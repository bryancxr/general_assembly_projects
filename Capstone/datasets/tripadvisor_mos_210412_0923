We stayed here for 3 days for a mini business appointment and a quick getaway.   Overall service of this hotel is great. The only slight hiccup with the property is the amount of people checking out from 11-12. It's so packed so you might want to check out early as they are very strict with their check out time. They don't allow late check out by the way (or probably we are the only ones who were denied)  Tv channel selection is limited but hey Singapore is a place to be travelled and explored so go out there and roam around.   Not a great place to spend honeymoon or anniversary as it's so packed they will eventually forget about you.  ,8.0,2016-10-01

I am most impressed with their friendly staff who are most willing to assist to your every whim. I did book through Agoda which somehow gives the best rates as i did try to call direct and it was at least S$230 more if you book direct.

However, it has dissapointed me during each of my pregnancy. First time I was placed in a room filled with construction and paint smell that I was not told about prior to checking in. Second time was recently when I was given a room with a broken air condition that couldn't be fixed after 3 visits from the engineering, flickering of all the room lights at night and a constant buzzing of the switch EVERY 30min to an hour. We switched rooms but buzzing from the a/c remained. Hotel location is undeniably excellent but when I come back at night the hotel should also provide me with a good nights sleep which is has failed to do so. I would hope my next visit would be different.",6.0,2016-08-01
