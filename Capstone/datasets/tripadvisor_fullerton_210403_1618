The cheese table was stunning, I have never seen so many cheese choices before in one place and they were really good cheeses.   The seafood wasn't as varied as I've had in other buffets and the lobster was a little dry.

Unfortunately, on the day itself, we opened the door to a sad looking little room, with a little balcony. The room was so embarrassing that our family and friends went back to the lobby instead. Even the curtains were dirtied and the bed cover had a small hole in it.  We were too tired to bother requesting for a change of rooms at the end of the day. Upon checking out, we reported the issues and were informed that the rooms on that level were the smallest (level 7?) and that we should have been given a room on level 6 instead, given that we were hosting our solemnization at the hotel.
