Great breakfast, nice location within a very short walk from over a dozen bars and restaurants. It is also incredibly close to the metro and main office area at Raffles.  The service was second to none. Special shout out to Rafi at Concierge desk who went out of his way to save my bacon!  Try to ask for a Marina Bay Room. It comes with a nice balcony and an uber fantastic view of the marina area.   The only reason it doesn’t get a 5 star from me is that the room is somewhat dated.
