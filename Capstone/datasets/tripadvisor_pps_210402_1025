My room was modern and had a nice bathroom, but these were the only good things to say about my stay. The check-in took ages because of a massive queue of people. After I got to the front of the queue the service wasn't that great. I had to ask for my large bag to be brought up to room and the receptionist didn't make me feel that welcome.

The staff seem to be the most accommodating and genuinely happy to help you than we have ever seen.  This includes everyone from the doormen, to the reception, to the lounge staff, to the pool staff, etc.  The outdoor pool is not too deep but wide enough to allow people to swim freely with comfortable seats (including couple-seats) edged along the outside.  There is a bar here and also a spa.  Near the pool is a gym equipped with practically everything you would want even if you are a professional",10.0,2017-02-01

465451127,pps,tripadvisor,2017-03-01,Philippines,Only an overnight stay so difficult to give broad assessment.,"As with much in Singapore to price appears high at first sight, but the hotel does at least represent good value for money. Hotel interior (atrium) has to be one of most dramatic I have seen; worth looking inside hotel just for this.",8.0,2017-03-01

Spend the little bit extra and stay in a club room. The 38th floor Pacific Club is extraordinary!!! French champagne and the most amazing cocktails included every evening. Lovely club with snacks and afternoon tea. The rooms are beautifully clean and maintained, soft towels and turn down service in the evening. Super close to MRT and shopping! The staff are just lovely x 360 views of Singapore from the club- beautiful sunset tonight ",10.0,2017-03-01
