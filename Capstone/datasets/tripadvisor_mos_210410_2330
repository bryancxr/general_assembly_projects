If I recall correctly, they had Singapore’s first discotheque called The Boiler Room.  The Mandarin has changed a lot over the past 5 decades but what hasn’t changed is the service and quality. Our family spent several nights there and we had no complaints with the room. It was clean, gave a new feel, we had a good view of Orchard Road and I think there was even an massage recliner in the room.  Took a dip in the pool one afternoon and the water was freezing cold.

I had room service with chicken rice which is evaluated as the best in Singapore.

Many of the men were obviously drunk and were shouting obscenities at each other for over an hour.  This made the situation unpleasant for everyone else in the lounge.

Check in was fine but when we asked for an extra bed for our 10 yr old we were told it would be an additional $100 per night plus the 21%.  Given that our rooms already cost $600 per night we thought this was absolutely outrageous.  We opted to have them provide blankets for the couch instead which worked only because he is small. The hotel is well located and yes there was a smartphone provided but having just come off of a 3 week SE Asian holiday, this is becoming more common.
