Cons - the rooms need  a refurb. The Powerpoints in my room (I stayed in room 571) were all coming out of the wall, some had been glued back into place with silicone which looked like my 10 y/o son had applied it, the aircon system is obviously ageing and there were signs of water leaks in the room.

When you first walk into the hotel your greeted by the smell of fresh flowers which are constantly looked after and grand in size. Once your into the middle of the grand lobby you've got a waterfall feature which goes to the ""basement"" level and features a large pool of Koi Carp.

At $395.00 p/night for a balcony room overlooking the river, whilst magnificent, is certainly on the very upper end of what I would be willing to spend on a room! As usual, I’ll start with the positives/pros of the hotel. Presentation/architecture: Does this really matter in the great scheme of things? For the price you pay, I’d argue yes, and you want to FEEL like you’re in a top notch hotel for that money.  From the outside, the hotel is beautiful, in elegant, almost Edwardian style architecture. Although totally grey from the outside, at night, the hotel lights up beautifully and can easily be seen from atop the Marina bay Sands across the river (we’ll get to the location in a second).
