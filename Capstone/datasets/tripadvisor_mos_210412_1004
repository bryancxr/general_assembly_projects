They ameliorate the situation with red-uniformed facilitators who guide people in the queue, both in the lobby and at the ground floor concierge.  It helps enormously to have an insider navigate you through the pandemonium. We checked in at close to midnight so there was no queue, and we were able to do an express check out even though I could not figure out how to press the ""confirm"" button on the TV screen.  I phoned and was granted an express check-out. We were upgraded to a superior room, 2045, that was large with a sofa and a king sized bed.
