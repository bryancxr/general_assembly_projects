But that’s where the compliments end and at around $750.00 per night it’s grossly overpriced for what it offers. The buffet food on the first floor is very disappointing with same same bainne maree food every day including Indian vegetarian curries that hardly got touched. The food in general at the buffet breakfast was poor with limited choices and limited quality. The Straights Club on the 4th floor was very uncomfortable overcrowded poor canapés and a very limited wine list as well as cocktail choices.

After 3 nights I moved to the Four Seasons at the same room rate and a different world of service and quality of food.  I don't like the outer Orchard Road location of the Four Seasons  as well as being downtown, but the move was worth while, and the Four Seasons is luxe.
