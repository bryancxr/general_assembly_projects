342587533,mos,tripadvisor,2016-01-01,China,Very good experience,"Third time staying in this hotel. Very hospitable staff ~ bell boy, front desk, lounge and restaurants. Questions answered promptly, smiling always, extremely helpful in all aspects. Room clean and comfortable. Location excellent. Good food. Nonetheless, the hainan chicken and lobster laksa not as good as I had tasted in the past. Should be at least hotter when served. Better to place the front desk on ground floor. Lounge provides 360 degrees view of the city with quiet and pleasant environment.",10.0,2015-12-01
342573400,mos,tripadvisor,2016-01-01,North Carolina,A good second choice,"Nice, large, clean room and helpful staff.  Seemed to be much more of a business hotel than I had hoped for.  Food in lobby restaurants was astronomically high-priced.  Lobby layout was a little strange, on 1st and 5th floors.  All staff members were pleasant, competent, and helpful.",8.0,2015-12-01
