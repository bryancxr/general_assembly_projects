It is the excellent friendly service that makes this place, but other positives include the huge and comfortable bed, double headed shower, daily laundry service (so we managed a week on hand luggage), 24 hour gym, and quality (and quantity!) of food wine and cocktails in the club lounge. Within a short walk to the Marina Bay and the Promenade MRT stop, places of interest were easy to access. Pool area was well staffed and maintained.

We had a warm welcome and quick check in and the reception area and lobby and bar are spectacular. The room was large and very clean and the beds comfortable and there were nice views.The hotel is well located in Marina Bay and Singapore is easily accessible from here. The hotel facilities are exceptional with great options for eating and drinking. Unfortunately the pool was out of action while we were there, but apart from that everything else was great.",10.0,2016-10-01

You don't even need to go outside there's an escalator from the hotel that takes you straight into the mall. We stayed in the city suite which was amazing...the rooms are very spacious and very clean. The suite has a separate living room which was great to lounge in. The bed is nice and big and the bathroom was nice and spacious too. The bar in the lobby is great too with cool seating areas. Staff are very pleasant and helpful.,10.0,2016-10-01

Service is excellent, and staff are always there to help. Rooms are of high quality, clean, and with all facilities you can really need. There are many restaurants within the hotel itself, with great variety. The pool area has just been refurbished and is now an excellent place to pass time during the day. Gym is also done with quality Tecnogym equipment. Highly recommend.",10.0,2016-09-01

424255557,pps,tripadvisor,2016-10-01,California,Could not have been better,"We expected it to be nice.  It was better.  From the greetings, personal attention, beautiful room, our 6 days were stress-free and a wonderful way to start a month-long vacation.  We opted to get a room with Pacific Club access and it was the best bargain we found in Singapore.  Between free breakfast buffet (loads of choices), and afternoon happy hour, we were never hungry.  But it was the attention to detail and the very personalized attention we received that made this hotel our hotel of choice whenever in Singapore.",10.0,2016-09-01
