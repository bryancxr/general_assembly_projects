264668208,fullerton,tripadvisor,2015-04-01,Texas,Service is second to none.,This hotel should be the best in Singapore. Best is the region. Best in the world. The service is second to none. They meet you at the door during checkin and walk you to the counter. They keep track of your stays and 'welcome you back' every time. They remember your preference for newspaper and everything. There is a cake boutique for take away gourmet desserts. The location is the best! Right in the middle of the old colonial area.  The pool is amazing. Beautiful views. There is an attendant that brings you ice water with lemon. You can order food.  I can't say enough good things about this hotel. ,10.0,2015-01-01

Service was exceptional - especially in the Club Lounge where staff greet you by name (the first time they greet you by name was a bit strange giving they had not met us before!). The extra cost for a Straits Club room is well worth it - includes champagne breakfast, afternoon tea (lovely scones) and evening cocktails (and bottomless champagne between 6 and 8 pm).  The building is the old post office, converted into a hotel, so don't expect the modern, ubiquitous square rooms offered by most large luxury hotel chains - would be impossible to compare the accommodation against, say, Ritz Carton, but would say The Fullerton exceeds on service.

207035994,fullerton,tripadvisor,2014-05-01,Japan,最高～っ！,　予想にたがわず良いホテルでした。６か月も前に予約したので、内容を忘れそうになりました。 夜景のきれいなキールーム（湾側）のテラス付きの部屋で、向かい側にあるマリーナベイサンズからのレーザー光線を３夜楽しみました。１泊4万円＋と少し高めでしたが満足できました。実は、２人ではなく３人で泊まったのです。特別ベッドを頼むと２万円プラスになるので、備え付けのキングサイズベッドで寝ましたが、それほど窮屈感はなかったです。 　気になったこと。バスタブと洗面所の間にブラインドがなく、タブを使っている人は洗面所の鏡にまともに裸が見えてしまうのです。換気扇の力もやや弱く、鏡が曇ってしまいます。それとシャワーノズルの切り替えが固くてうまくいかず、係員を呼んでやっと解決しました。備品は２人用しか準備されていませんでしたが、常時６階に係員がいて声をかけるとすぐに持ってきてもらえました。ＮＨＫ番組も見られるのでなんだか外国に来た感じがあまりなかったです。ところで、常駐の日本人スタッフが私たちが着いた翌日休暇を取って日本へ帰国してしまいました。そんな時やはり片言でも英語が話せると便利ですね。 　朝食なしのプランだったのですが、１回だけ話のタネにビュッフェを利用しました。１人５，０００円くらいでこれもちょっと高めでしたが、内容にはとても豊富です。メニューを置いてある場所は、途中に段差があるので転ばないよう注意する点以外は満足しました。 　せっかく泊まるなら見晴らしの良い部屋がいいですね。,10.0,2014-05-01
