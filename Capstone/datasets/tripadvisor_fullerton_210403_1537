The staff at the door, reception, restaurant/room service and poolside are a credit to your hotel. They were so friendly, accommodating and helpful and made our short stay a great one. It was our anniversary while in Singapore and the room was decorated beautifully with Balloons, Strawberries and Wine.  On the poolside the gentleman overseeing the pool was really attentative coming up with glasses of water and even ice lollies at one point. The pool was gorgeous over looking the city and was great to relax for an hour in the sun.  The location of the hotel couldn't get any better and we managed to walk alot of places from the hotel.

First off, the architecture is very nice - no doubt about it. However the infrastructure is bit old.  While it's quite well maintained, there is wears and tears on the sockets, walls, cabinets.  I am staying on the side which has only one elevator - every time (I mean every time!) I have to wait quite long for elevator.  It works very slowly.  Not a good news if you are in a rush for business.  Second, I don't get the ""warm"" services that I read from other reviews.  Maybe it's just my luck.
