Totally unacceptable especially at the significant price premium. Our room was large and spacious but the space was underutilized. It seems like they just spread the furniture out rather than adding pieces to add warmth and comfort. When watching the light show be sure to take it in from ground level as well as in your room. It is a very different experience.  The casino was huge but you had to queue to have your passport checked to go in and to leave.  That took 10 minutes each time.  Subway access was easy.

When arriving from the airport I was blown away by the number of people checking in. However, everything ran like a well-oiled machine. The wait was minimal. This was the first glimpse of the scale and size of the property. For some reason, I was expecting to walk up to an empty check-in desk.

It looms over the bay like some giant's toy cricket stumps, with the Art and Science museum like an abandoned broken ball by its side. Just hope the giant doesn't come back anytime soon to restart the game!! You quickly run out of superlatives as you move around the hotel - biggest, best, highest, longest etc. Even the flower pots in the lobby atrium are taller than a man and house trees rather than flowers.  To carry on with the cricket analogy I stayed high up in the off stump (Tower 3) just beneath the bails. The tower curved away from me below so my window looked straight to the ground below and out over the spectacular bay and skyline beyond.  The rooms are big",10.0,2016-09-01

There's something for everyone to do. Being connected to the mall with a Theater and the Arts and Science Museum is nice since there's a diversity in what people can do. There's also a connection to the Gardens by the Bay.  Bus stop and MRT stop also available. Taxi cabs also available.    Of course there's also a casino for those who want to gamble. It's nice that there is a no smoking area since some people want to go to the casino but are turned off by the smell of smoke.    There are nice dining options within the hotel. Dined at Hide Yamamoto (Japanese) located above the casino and the food and service was excellent.  Jin Shan (Chinese) located at the hotel's lobby offered great afternoon teatime dimsum.

I can only explain it as 'welcome to obnoxious Ville' it hurt to be by the pool. iPads and and phones attached to people who sit by the infinity pool hours on end taking hundreds of selfies!

Another event is that when I try to go to 1st floor, the lift went down to certain level and then started to go up again.   The service attitude is ok but I can't feel the enthusiasm.

We had taken an over-night train from Malaysia, so this was heaven when we arrived! As we arrived early, the room wasn't ready when we arrived, but that was no problem - we were given access to the pool until the room was ready, which was what we were there for anyways!

From the moment you arrive in front if the hotel and the moment when you exit the hotel you can put your brain to rest and let the hotel staff take care of everything. Awsome service, amazing views and the pool!!!  Tip of advice:  - ask for early check-in to avoid all the new guests with the standard check in.  - Avoid going to the infinity pool from 4 to 7pm as it is fully packed with people.  - If you plan to go to one of the restaurants in the hotel area book ahead of time as usually they are sold out for 1 day in advance.
