2,,ADHD,"Dr. Andrew Huberman is a professor at Stanford, his podcast Huberman Lab is amazing. 10/10 recommend.

He referenced a study done on sleep and performance. Turns out, consistently getting ~about~ the same amount of sleep each night is better than striving for this magical 8 hours (which apparently is kinda bullshit)

So if you sleep for 4 hours, 6 hours, 5 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours... that will be better for you than if you were to sleep 4 hours, 9 hours, 5 hours, 8 hours, 10 hours. I hope that makes sense. 

The most comforting thing is - don’t worry about following a set of rules when it comes to sleeping. If it works for you, you’re probably doing the right thing (even if it’s not the magic number)

So if you stress about “getting enough sleep”, try to be consistent with whatever amount of time you usually get.

6,,ADHD,"I have ADHD, depression, anxiety, and possibly bipolar 2. My brain is physically different due to the adhd alone. 

The other day my partner described moving to another task briefly while in the middle of a debate with me (I had to vacuum real quick) and he told me he forgot what it was and had to reconstruct his thoughts when we resumed our conversation. Maybe he's adhd as well but idk. It also doesn't help I don't have a baseline for ""normal"" lol.

I basically cannot fathom how ""normal"" people function. My brain is CONSTANTLY going. I'll start on one thought and end up on another which is a complete 180.

Can I also mention how fuckin tired I am all the god damn time? Idk if its my depression or adhd or both but i am routinely exhausted. I'll get hit with random waves of strong fatigue. It feels like I can't do anything because I'm so tired. I feel like i could sleep all day and night and STILL be tired. It doesn't make sense! And normal people don't deal with that??? They're just... awake??? And when they're tired they drink caffeine and then they're awake??? With caffeine there's a 50/50 chance it wakes me up or puts me to sleep. I don't understand how that fuckin works but it does.

Ya know what else I don't understand? How do people just... do things?? Like, their brain says 'do the thing' and their body just gets up and does it???? Mine is like a lump and won't move unless I scream internally a lot. And even then it doesn't always work.

7,,ADHD,"My 7-year-old daughter, who is awaiting diagnosis, tries her hardest but struggles to focus and remember what she needs to do. She's a lot like me.

As we were leaving for school, we went through her schoolbag checklist.

""Homework?""

""Yep.""

""Lunch?""

""Got it""

""Piano Books?""

""Oh, I forgot, they're in my room!"" 

Her piano books are a big issue. She has lessons at school once a week and often forgets them.

We get to school and I drop her off only to realise that I have lost my wallet. Crap. I've left it at my friend on the other side of town's house. So I head over to his house. Soon as I arrive, I get a call from school.

""Your daughter has forgot her lunch.""

HOW?!?! It was in her bag. I saw it! 

Oh well, I chat with my friend for a couple of minutes and then head back to pick up her lunchbox and...the phone rings. It's the school wondering where I am. IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME! I wasted the whole morning with my friend! I grab the lunchbox (it was under a pile of books) and head to the school.

She gets her lunch ten minutes late and every is fine.

I've just walked in the door and sitting in front of me on the kitchen table is the ""pile of books"" her lunch was under.

It's her piano books. 

I need a drink.

8,,ADHD,"A colleague forwarded me [this article](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/03/what-pandemic-doing-our-brains/618221/) about ""Pandemic Brain"" and I just found it to be heartbreaking and ironically amusing. For example, here's a description of what the author is experiencing:

&gt; Sometimes I grasp at a word or a name. Sometimes I walk into the kitchen and find myself bewildered as to why I am there. (At one point during the writing of this article, I absentmindedly cleaned my glasses with nail-polish remover.) Other times, the forgetting feels like someone is taking a chisel to the bedrock of my brain, prying everything loose. 

It's like: Yeah.  That's me ALL THE TIME.  That was me on my BEST days BEFORE the pandemic.

Another quote:

&gt; Everywhere I turn, the fog of forgetting has crept in. A friend of mine recently confessed that the morning routine he’d comfortably maintained for a decade—wake up before 7, shower, dress, get on the subway—now feels unimaginable on a literal level: He cannot put himself back there. 

Again, me, every single day BEFORE the pandemic.

Meanwhile, her third grader, who is attending in-person school, keeps leaving his books, papers, and lunch at home. Inny Ekeolu, a 19-year-old student from Ireland, says she has found herself forgetting how to do things she used to do on a regular basis: swiping her bus pass, paying for groceries.

Let me tell you why. 

Achieving goals requires consistency. But consistency is boring.

It’s boring because you have to do the same thing over and over. For example, you want to learn to cook. 
You have to be CONSISTENT. You have to cook every week. You have to cook the same time to master it. 

But BORING is the death of us. The second we are bored with something, we move on to the next goal.

14,,ADHD,"As the title says, I thought I'd share some of my skills I have learned over the years that help mitigate some of my adhd symptoms. I am aware that everyone experiences the symptoms of this disease differently, so I will add that these tips may not be for everyone, but I figured they may help some.

\- Eat a high-protein breakfast as soon as you can in the morning. This has some scientific backing that you can research, but essentially it sets your brain up for good performance. Eggs, meat, protein bars, etc. are all things that have helped me feel more mentally prepared during the early hours of the day. 

\- To help cut down on ""time-blindness"" related shenanigans, I started playing a game where I try to guess the time before each time that I check a clock. I've always been surprised just how bad I was at predicting the amount of time some tasks take, but after doing this trick for a bit it has gotten a little better for me. 

\- Put your overactive imaginations to work! I have always had an overactive imagination, running so constantly and vividly that it sometimes is the main cause of my distractions. I'm sure some of you have experience in this. I've had some success generating interest in dull tasks and work-related things by just simply imagining it being more interesting. I know this sounds childish, but who cares if it works right?

\- Caffeine is more helpful by itself than it is with all of the sugar and add-ins from energy drinks and supplements. Caffeine consumed as stand-alone pills can be pretty effective at helping to maintain focus and clarity without too many side effects (watch your intake, no more than 2-3 200mg pills spaced out over a day for most people). Energy drinks can be great for improving alertness and boosting energy, but I have always found they actually reduce my ability to focus. This is not the case with coffee, tea, and other things that have caffeine without all the add-ins (such as taurine, insane amounts of b-vitamins, etc.). 

\- Make removing clutter a high priority. Clutter is a way of life for a lot of us, but trying to mitigate symptoms while surrounded by unfinished obligations causes sensory overload for me. Speaking for myself, when I enter a room in my house I literally notice and am fully aware of all the visible clutter in the room. I've realized that this takes up valuable resources in my brain that could be better spent on other things. I notice that I have an easier time managing symptoms when I have eliminated the clutter. As for the motivation to get it done, the best time for me is on a day off, immediately after breakfast, coffee, and medicine. 

\- More frequent short breaks are better than fewer long breaks. I feel like my brain works on a shorter time scale than others. Anticipating a 30 minute break that is 4 hrs into my shift is distant enough into the future that it is almost abstract in my awareness. Taking a 5 minute break every hour keeps me focused and refreshed and I have an easier time staying aware of what I can do within that hour before a quick break. 

\- You don't need a bullet journal, you just need a notebook with page numbers and an index. This is essentially what a bullet journal is, but don't bother with all the other stuff that people swear you need (calendars, habit trackers, etc.) you just need a place where you can write notes and be able to find it easy for later. If you already have a system that works for you that is great, but I find with a lot of adhd people that adding all the extras that require consistency are just adding more things to keep track of that really aren't that helpful. They also just add more things to procrastinate on which can lower your mood. Keep it simple and don't create more obligations in an attempt to help keep track of your current obligations.

16,,ADHD,"I can’t explain it to anyone. Not in a way they’d understand. I’m venting, because it hurts, knowing my career is destroyed, my life in ruins, all because of this fucking condition, despite all the medication.

My ADHD never interfered with my learning, because I’d get everything done before I lost interest. For my entire life, I was the first one done with exams. I’d usually ace them too. I took the LSAT after maybe studying it for an hour, about the most I could manage. I got a 166.

I graduated a top 20 law school in the top 20% of my class.

And I am a failure.

In the past five years since graduating, I have been fired from 3 jobs for performance issues, all from 2017-2018. I had to run around doing social security disability hearings on a contract basis for a year and a half, before getting a job as general counsel for a small company (hence my name) before that too ended in January. They said my performance wasn’t an issue and it was just that they took on in-house too early. Maybe, but, in my head, I wonder otherwise, although I never did get a complaint.

I regularly get fleeting suicidal thoughts because of how frustrated and despondent I am about my career. All my life, everyone said I’d do great. Instead, I’m a fucking bum. I won’t hurt myself, I’m devoutly Catholic, couldn’t do it, also I know people love me.

It’s impossible to explain to people. They say “You’ll bounce back”. What suggests I will bounce back? I fucking can’t keep a job.

I have a great doc who truly cares, and we are changing my medications. But I don’t think it will matter. I’ve been medicated since the first grade. I take it every day. It made no difference at my job.

I feel robbed. I feel like I got the ultimate screw. To be good throughout school, and then to fail when it matters. I wish I wasn’t smart at all. At least I’d have no expectations.

22,,ADHD,"A month or two ago I really got the idea that I could have un-diagnosed ADHD. Basically looking into how it presents in adults, looking at threads here of other folks experience and having constant ""oh my god, that's exactly what I'm like"" reactions, etc.

My story, why I think I have ADHD:

* emotional / short-fuse as a kid
* As a young child I heard stories of me running out of class to go have recess when it wasn't time, but I don't remember it.
* Had major problems rambling and people think I was annoying
* Throughout elementary school teachers always giving the feedback that I'm doing well, but daydreaming all the time
* Later elementary school once we had our first ""long-term"" projects (rather than just daily assignments) is when I started to have a hard time. Had one that my Mom essentially did in 5th grade because I put it off to the last minute, another in 6th grade that I failed but hid the report card from my parents so they never found out.
* Always pacing during conversations, can't sit still
* Jr. high I got good grades but continuing the trend of assignments all being completed last minute when the urgency kicks in. Lost a letter grade in Science even though I did well on the tests because our teacher required them to be taken home to be signed by parent
* High school always running late, trouble getting assignments in on time, didn't take study halls because I couldn't use the time appropriately anyways. Got everything done super quick last minute anyways.
* Had a teacher organize their seating chart based solely on where I was sitting relative to my friends (because I talked so much during class)
* Fell asleep during ACT's but still got good enough grades to go to state school
* In college same thing...just got everything done last minute. But it seems like everyone did that??? I don't know...
* A lot of anxiety / depression because I feel like I'm not reaching my potential because I'm lazy / unmotivated
* Now I've been working for 6 years at a company that has a culture of very little oversight and a ton of meetings. I don't have a problem attending meetings because I just multi-task if it's boring and walk around the house. Outside of attending meetings and responding to emails if I have any independent work it often takes me days / weeks to build up the motivation to do a couple hours of work. On average I probably do only about 30 minutes to 1 hour of independent work per day

The ""problem"" is that I've been successful in my job but I feel super trapped. Like I've found this niche situation where I'm being paid decently, have a great manager, great work-life balance, but I feel horrible because I feel like I'm doing 1/10th of what I could be doing if I could just work 8 hours a day.

Had a meeting with a new therapist yesterday and we just went down the rabbit hole of talking about my job. She didn't say it, but I got the vibe that she didn't really think I had ADHD, and was just going on about ""what are your goals"", ""I think your job is just too easy and you're bored"", ""you're unmotivated because you don't have accountability"", etc......

I don't know....maybe I'm overreacting, but I just feel like I needed some validation that's like ""yup, it sounds like you have ADHD""....and I didn't get that. I know the things that she's saying are probably helpful whether I get the diagnosis or not....but it just has me second guessing things.

What's your take?

26,,ADHD,"Sorry this is so long, maybe there's someone out there who will read this and I can connect with. Im overwhelmed and here's my verbal diarrhea. 

Always thought ADHD was the kid bouncing off the walls who couldn't sit still and that wasn't me. This community has opened my eyes and resonating with me a lot.

Organizing my life and doing all the ""normal"" things is so overwhelming to me. I never remember what I'm forgetting or not doing. The weight of always being behind on things, having forgotten things, being disorganized, is constant. And I don't even remember what all the things are I am behind on or need to do. 

If my bills aren't on autopay they don't get paid. Forgetting to pay my bills has impacted my credit score even though I have plenty of money.

I've shown up to cities on the wrong day, airports on the wrong hours, shown up to job interviews and realized I forgot half my suit, and just feel like I can't keep things straight or remember them right. 

My company doesn't understand why I can't submit my timesheets on time like everyone else, or why I can't prepare and submit my expense claims on time. It's gotten really bad and I'm known as the ""special case"". They tolerate it because I'm exceptional at what I do when I can focus. 

In university, lectures were such a slow pace and so boring. One time I missed my entire semester of classes because the first lecture was moving way too slow, then forgot I was even enrolled in the class. At the end of the semester I saw my exam of the course I forgot on my schedule two days before the test. I crashed the entire course in two days of hyperfocus before the exam and got the highest mark in the class (final exam was 100% of the grade if you missed the midterm).

I know I'm smart and it has gotten me by and on the outside it seems I'm thriving in many aspects. I've been promoted early for everything and seen as an overachiever. I've been at my job for 10 years but bounced around from division and function every couple years maximum. I change my work location every couple hours, and can't sit at a desk for a 9-5. I change where I live often and jetset around the world. 

I struggle so hard to get up in the mornings. I didn't know that was associated with ADHD. I sleep in until the last minute or miss things. In grade 10 I spent a semester unable to get out of bed on Mondays until the afternoons and would miss my mornings of school. 

I honestly can't remember what I can't remember as to all the reasons I think maybe I could have ADHD.

Last week I tried Adderall for the first time to see what effect it would have (not via prescription). I was able to sit for HOURS and work. I got things done I had been putting off for MONTHS. But I also felt like a zombie and not myself. 

I'm overwhelmed. What if I have ADHD? And now that I've thought maybe I do and it could explain so much in my life, what if I don't??? I'm almost more scared I dont have it. 

I'm trying to get myself to go through the diagnosis process now but it's hard. I have to try and organize my benefits package, sign up for their online portal, figure out how to contact their services, etc. I spent some time today then gave up.

I’m just happy to feel happy and energized today, and I’m definitely going to ride this out for as long as I can!&lt;/p&gt;

38,,ADHD,"Hello I'm 26F. I was diagnosed not even a year ago but suspected it a while before. There were signs, seems obvious now. This means I suddenly recognise some patterns in other people.

**My mother has undiagnosed ADHD, I am sure of this.**

She went through a rough time when I came around due to other reasons and was under stress.

Growing up:

1.There's unread bills and papers everywhere. We always had cereal and other crap for dinner in front of the TV (3 times a week tops I'd say bc my grandparents were involved otherwise). 

2.We had a bedroom in our house we couldn't use because it was so filled with unused furniture and papers and so much stuff that she never got to. We had to climb if we needed something (wasn't dirty, it was just many things)

3.I had a backlog of vaccinations to get. I had to get 3 at once, one time, because they were past due and the school wouldn't let me enroll otherwise (no she's not anti Vax, she's just overwhelmed when there's things to get done). I never got the HPV vaccine for the same reasons even though it was free.

4. Mood swings, so much accumulated frustration. It got worse when I became an ADHD teenager of course and there were a lot of fights.

5. She always got into projects at home and then had a couple accidents. Eg. Decided to paint the cupboards and accidentally ended up glueing her forehead to the cabinets. Dropped the ladder and went to pick it up without noticing glass shards, needed many many stitches, there was so much blood. And many other things.

6. After moving out I had to go to her place and she didn't want me to. I found out its because it was an incredible mess. She is amazing at cleaning up the day before, it looks like there was never any mess. But you can't ever go unannounced...

7. She has this compulsion to say she'll help and then the time comes and she doesn't do the things she said she would, and she's the one who offered.

8. We were late to everything. I was always late to school, she often was late to pick me up. Lateness is a main thing in my life and her life and it's impossible to correct at this point.

Did you guys notice the same in your parents?

I wish she were diagnosed so she could have recognized it in me instead of not knowing how to parent and me being a ""bad child"" and demonized for leaving a wet towel on my bed and not tidying my room enough. There were SO many fights. Nobody got how or why it was difficult for me to remember the dishes.

To me, living like it's your last is exactly what it's like living with ADHD at times. 

 I live every emotion like it'll be the last time I fell that emotion because I dont have the ability in real time to remember when the last time I felt that emotion was and change my behavior accordingly. 

I interrupt people like it's my last day on earth because if I dont I feel like I'll never remember and never have a chance to say what I wanted to say. 

I make decisions like it's my last day on earth because I can't see how that decision will impact my future.

44,,ADHD,"TL;DR: any advice on constant exhaustion/fatigue?

I'm just tired all the time. It doesn't help that I've moved back home and due to the time difference have to work online till 3:30 am. Seroquel helps me sleep at night (diagnosed bipolar as well) but I'm just... a zombie during the day. 

Pre-covid, my highest high was the brief period where I was living my best life. I miss the routine that I worked hard to create, waking up before dawn, enjoying the sunrise and quiet morning, while also magically  being more productive in those 2 hours than the other 22 during the day. Getting in some exercise and nature on my bike ride to work, lunch hour zumba class at my work gym and evenings to people-watch or read at a park, tend to my community garden or socialize. My mind, body and soul felt nourished. This was a big win after a lifetime of trouble sleeping and waking up - I had finally found a way to have a fully occupied day to tire myself out and fall asleep at a decent hour. Of course, this would come and go with slumps in mental health but it gave me hope of a semblance of normalcy and balance for my life. Now I can hardly drag myself out of bed at 2 in the afternoon after 10 hours of sleep. 

Depression hit me hard late last fall when I decided to move home but it has been a chaotic mess. My parents are super supportive but my home/family life is crazy and overwhelming, my schedule and medication has been a bit out of whack (I was diagnosed ADHD in Oct but hadn't started on adderall yet while adjusting my depression/bipolar meds) and the one doctor I approached to get my prescription transferred was an abominable adhd denier. I am honestly infuriated by those who claim to be in a profession to help people, or at least do no harm, ignorantly invalidate our experiences and the SCIENCE behind this neurobiological condition which frankly, most of us have worked so hard to come to terms with due to the stigma and disinformation out there. 

It has been over 2 months and I'm so tired. I'm tired of being a husk of myself - the me I have seen and the potential that I know. I just can't function as a human being. I'm drifting along day by day as my heart aches to just brush my teeth. I haven't showered in weeks. The mental jujitsu by which I plan and negotiate what I can do tomorrow and then silently watch in pain as I can't bring myself to do any of it. I'm just sick of myself.

The worst part is, I was so elated with my diagnosis. It finally helped me answer so much about my struggles, gifted kid who completely crumbled in college and all my plans and ambitions which never materialize. I had something tangible to say: I'm not lazy and unmotivated and dumb, I'm fighting a real condition in my brain day to day to survive. But I've somehow fallen prey to the belief that I am incapable without the medication I need which will cure me and help kick start my brain to do all I want to.

I know I can do this. I know I will. I will try again tomorrow and the day after and onwards.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m hoping to eventually figure out how to manage my time &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; to carry out my good intentions most of the time. Has anyone found techniques that have helped them long-term?&lt;/p&gt;

62,,ADHD,"\[Disclaimer: I'm not saying using nicotine is a good idea. I'm not saying you shouldn't try to quit it if you're addicted, you probably should. This is just observation\]

I've just recently realized that I have problems in my life that I can really only explain by me working differently. Seeing videos and reading about ADHD has been an eye-opener. I've heard countless times that people with ADHD tend to self-medicate, and boy does that make sense to me now.  
I've had some revealing observations lately, related to my (believed) ADHD and brain altering substances.

Dec 20 last year I quit nicotine (bags). My feeling has been that my mind is scattered and I'm restless. I've been unfocused, have had immense troubles with following through on tasks, quite absent minded as well. When I've sat down and tried to work, I've had a hard time motivating me to even do stuff I know is simple. I think about how many extra steps it will take and it just doesn't feel effortless.

I've noticed this and attributed it to me quitting nicotine. I've quit before, in my experience it took a couple of months for me to not think about picking up the habit again. Only this time the scattered brain and restlessness never wore off, it's almost 3 months since I quit and I don't feel ""recovered"". Really, I'm not quite sure they ever did the previous times.

I've been a mess at work right now. That and I'm waiting for my next appointment, it's 3 weeks away.

Yesterday I bought nicotine mints in hopes of it relieving some of the symptoms I've been experiencing. I want to point out that I believe myself to be fully recovered from the nicotine bags, I've been resolute on not picking up that habit again. This was a conscious decision in hopes of relief and so that I can focus on work.

Today I've used 4 mints: 2 before lunch, 2 after. I just want to say that I'm baffled, the effects are very noticeable. A few minutes in I felt more focused, more purposeful, less overwhelmed, there was less of a barrier to just do stuff and I actually dug into something I've been dreading and putting off for too long.  
I'm not saying nicotine made me employee off the month, but it pushed me over a threshold I've been trying to cross for several months now, in a very noticeable way.

As a comparison, each mint is 1mg, so that's 4mg for the whole work day. Each nicotine bag is 1-2mg, and I might've gone 10-15 in a work day.  
The mints just lie in your mouth until they're gone, for 2.5h, the intake is much slower compared to the bags. There was SOME withdrawal at 16:00, which I might need to keep in mind.

Of course I don't want to get into an addiction again, I'd rather find medication that's tuned to my needs. But it's very clear to me now how nicotine have affected me in my life both when I've been on and off it.  
I'm probably gonna use mints until then, but I might try to use less than 2 per 2.5h period.

63,,ADHD,"Hello! 

I was previously on 10mg of Adderall XR and it was astronomically too high of a dose for me (for reference I get high off of the adult dose of Benadryl and am a lightweight with basically every substance and medicine ever) so my doctor moved me to 5mg of Adderall XR and it works great... after a few hours. In the first 4-5 hours I’m exhausted beyond belief. 

Being at home during the pandemic is helpful while trying to adjust / find a medication that works for me, but I wanted to pop in here and ask if this is normal? I get so incredibly tired on Adderall, like all I could do right now is just sleep for ages. Will this fatigue reaction go away? It makes me feel a bit foggy and tired and I feel more “focus” but I also feel groggy and exhausted. I feel like I could accomplish more if I *wasnt* tired. 

I read on here someone saying that if your sleep schedule is bad it can cause this to happen because addy will highlight any sleep deprivation you might have. 

Anyway, any advice? Will this probably go away as I get used to Adderall? This is my first time taking any adhd medication. Is there anything I might be doing wrong? I started getting some muscle twitches and I breifly wondered if my electrolytes are off, last time I had muscle twitches it was because my diet was sorely lacking potassium. 

If I allow myself to sleep while on Adderall , I end up waking up feeling very refreshed and totally ready to take on anything but this ruins my schedule.

EDIT I WANTED TO ADD: I am in pretty close easy contact with my doctor and psychologist, they’re a message away via a patient portal and ultimately I’ll be bringing it up with them too, but I wanted to hear from the experience of other adhd’ers about this.

EDIT 2: I am also wondering what about diet can affect this.

Which is the exact opposite of how I have felt my whole life. I also feel guilty if I spend too much time doing something merely for pleasure. Because it is preventing me from doing productive things. In a way, I love this feeling so much, but I just don’t know how to deal with it healthfully.

81,,ADHD,"UPDATE AFTER TALKING: Read below for context. So we talked on the phone and it went about as horribly as I could have possibly imagined. It started off okay, I asked her some questions and told her I wasn't demanding an answer. It's all kind of a blur now but she basically told me that she was feeling the same connection I felt, up until we were about to have sex. I asked her if something happened that triggered a flashback. She took a long time to think and said that it probably wasn't a flashback. She told me that she just changed her mind after we were passionately kissing for twenty minutes. She said she's finicky and it causes emotional instability in other people. Those were her exact words and she said it while laughing. I was going to initially tell her off, but after talking to you guys I thought I would give her the benefit of the doubt. I did up until she said that.

For some added context, when we met we bonded over music, and she sent me this incredibly intense romantic song, right down the line by Gary Rafferty. I knew I was interested by then and her sending the song was kind of a fun little tease. I sent a love song back and we did that back and forth while getting to know each other. And every song she sent was the same: intense love song, no variation. Our first date we spent the entire day together. She brought me back to her house. I brought her to mine. She met my dad and we had dinner and laughed and talked until 10pm. At the end she told me she definitely wants to see me again. We were texting almost every day and by all indication she seemed at least interested in dating me. I asked her about that today and she tells me it was completely unintentional. The night before I asked her if I misread anything and she said no. But today it was all in my head. I'm not saying that I was expecting her to be my soulmate, but I didn't expect this either. It was like she was running hot this whole time and last night she switched to cold. 

It became clear to me that she didn't understand how damaging or confusing this was, especially because she kept laughing and her tone was like we were having a sunny afternoon chat. I tried to explain what happened to me the last time someone pulled a 180 on me like this (in the comments), how traumatic it was and she just kept saying the same three or four things over and over about how people are complicated, feelings change all the time etc, it's not her fault that I was hurt in the exact same way...she kept meandering and contradicting herself it felt like I was talking to a different person. As the conversation went on she just got more and more careless and kept laughing like it was a funny little misunderstanding. At this point I started breaking down, I told her that last night was one of my worst nightmares, and I wish I'd never met her. And then I hung up. 

Recounting this has caused something to resurface: last night we had drinks, and she was pretty quick to finish her drink. I've been known to put away a few so I didn't think anything of it. Sometime during or after dinner she mentioned that she used to be in a relationship with an alcoholic and it was very traumatic for her. This never once came up before, and both dates we drank together. I think something about us drinking and being intimate set her off. But according to her she just changed her mind, so I don't know. There were some other things I found kind of weird. When she sent me that love song deep down I wondered if that was too intense for someone to be sending a potential lover they just met. I mentioned in the comments that I'm Brazilian and coincidentally she happened to spend time in Brazil and speaks some Portuguese. Turns out it wasn't a coincidence-- when we matched she looked me up on LinkedIn and saw that I was Brazilian. Then she waited to tell me until we'd talked more and gotten closer. I guess that was a red flag. I don't know what to take way from this. I've been in situations before where I caught feelings for the other person and deep down I knew they didn't feel the same. Like no matter what I said outwardly I knew my feelings weren't fully reciprocated. But this is the first time it's happened with someone I was convinced felt the same. Who by all outward appearances was at least interested in giving it a shot with me. I don't know what I'm going to do at this point, because I'm so suggestible and have imposter syndrome I'm convinced that there's something wrong with me and no matter how good of a fit the next person seems it will end the same way. I actually don't think there is anyone who is a good fit for me anymore. Every woman who has rung that bell ended up changing her mind. It's happened three or four times now at varying stages of dating. 

TLDR: we talked about what happened on the phone, and she made it seem like what happened was a funny little mishap, like it was so silly I would even ask about it. I feel worse than I ever thought I could feel.  I have severe depression and anxiety issues in addition to the ADHD and I don't see a way out of this for me without a drastic personality change and that's not going to happen. I feel humiliated, pathetic, stupid, unwanted, gullible, and violated. And I have to go through this completely alone, trapped inside my house in the dead of winter. I give up. 

&amp;#x200B;

ORIGINAL POST:

I'll try to keep this short. Right now I'm more heart broken I think than I've ever been. I met someone a few weeks ago, I'll call her C,  and when I say it felt like we were made for each other I mean it. Before I met her I was in a relationship for eight months and I felt closer to C in two weeks than I ever did with my ex.

This has happened before and it's always ended with me getting hurt. But in the past there was something I could pin point that at least gave me some clarity on what went wrong. I was too clingy, or I was neglectful, or she was giving off bad vibes...something. But with C, for the first time I felt that I clicked with someone who was as emotionally direct/honest as I am and who wasn't going to play games. She made it clear to me that she was catching feelings and I reciprocated. I thought it was going to be different this time because of the emotional honesty.

Last night we had our second date and it was perfect. We cooked dinner at her place and we had some drinks. No indication of anything wrong. We end up on the couch, undressing and kissing and after about 20 minutes she stops, gets up, stares off in silence for a while and then tells me she just realized she was wrong about how she felt about me. We talk some more and eventually she hands me clothes and I leave. She tells me we can't see each other anymore.

I don't understand any of this. Dating while being ND is scary enough but to have someone lure you into this fall sense of security...my entire reality is unraveling. And it keeps happening. This is just the worst one so far because I thought I found someone I could really be myself around, no mask. I'm 30 and I've been in one relationship that hasn't imploded in a couple months. I'm an absolute wreck right now and I don't know if anyone is even going to understand or reply to this. I don't even know if I'm making sense. It wouldn't be as bad except there's not a single person in my life emotionally equipped to talk me through this, not even my family. Even my therapist isn't the best at talking me through stuff like this. I don't know what to do. I just want to give up on life and become a vegetable.

If anyone out there can tell me anything other than ""just move on"" or ""you got attached too quick"" or anything that sounds remotely like NT dating advice please I'm begging you respond. I'm drowning in my own body.

TLDR: a lifetime of dating with ADHD has caused me to lose the ability to trust other people and my own feelings. The last straw was when a date I had with someone who I thought was the ""one"", who purposefully led me to believe that she was, ended with her realizing she felt nothing for me and kicking me out. Any support would help please.",t2_29qjnica,False,,0,False,How can I survive dating with ADHD?,[],r/ADHD,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_m28zl1,False,light,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Questions/Advice/Support,False,3,,False,self,1615423908.0,,[],{},,True,,1615440142.0,text,0,,,text,self.ADHD,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;UPDATE AFTER TALKING: Read below for context. So we talked on the phone and it went about as horribly as I could have possibly imagined. It started off okay, I asked her some questions and told her I wasn&amp;#39;t demanding an answer. It&amp;#39;s all kind of a blur now but she basically told me that she was feeling the same connection I felt, up until we were about to have sex. I asked her if something happened that triggered a flashback. She took a long time to think and said that it probably wasn&amp;#39;t a flashback. She told me that she just changed her mind after we were passionately kissing for twenty minutes. She said she&amp;#39;s finicky and it causes emotional instability in other people. Those were her exact words and she said it while laughing. I was going to initially tell her off, but after talking to you guys I thought I would give her the benefit of the doubt. I did up until she said that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some added context, when we met we bonded over music, and she sent me this incredibly intense romantic song, right down the line by Gary Rafferty. I knew I was interested by then and her sending the song was kind of a fun little tease. I sent a love song back and we did that back and forth while getting to know each other. And every song she sent was the same: intense love song, no variation. Our first date we spent the entire day together. She brought me back to her house. I brought her to mine. She met my dad and we had dinner and laughed and talked until 10pm. At the end she told me she definitely wants to see me again. We were texting almost every day and by all indication she seemed at least interested in dating me. I asked her about that today and she tells me it was completely unintentional. The night before I asked her if I misread anything and she said no. But today it was all in my head. I&amp;#39;m not saying that I was expecting her to be my soulmate, but I didn&amp;#39;t expect this either. It was like she was running hot this whole time and last night she switched to cold. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It became clear to me that she didn&amp;#39;t understand how damaging or confusing this was, especially because she kept laughing and her tone was like we were having a sunny afternoon chat. I tried to explain what happened to me the last time someone pulled a 180 on me like this (in the comments), how traumatic it was and she just kept saying the same three or four things over and over about how people are complicated, feelings change all the time etc, it&amp;#39;s not her fault that I was hurt in the exact same way...she kept meandering and contradicting herself it felt like I was talking to a different person. As the conversation went on she just got more and more careless and kept laughing like it was a funny little misunderstanding. At this point I started breaking down, I told her that last night was one of my worst nightmares, and I wish I&amp;#39;d never met her. And then I hung up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recounting this has caused something to resurface: last night we had drinks, and she was pretty quick to finish her drink. I&amp;#39;ve been known to put away a few so I didn&amp;#39;t think anything of it. Sometime during or after dinner she mentioned that she used to be in a relationship with an alcoholic and it was very traumatic for her. This never once came up before, and both dates we drank together. I think something about us drinking and being intimate set her off. But according to her she just changed her mind, so I don&amp;#39;t know. There were some other things I found kind of weird. When she sent me that love song deep down I wondered if that was too intense for someone to be sending a potential lover they just met. I mentioned in the comments that I&amp;#39;m Brazilian and coincidentally she happened to spend time in Brazil and speaks some Portuguese. Turns out it wasn&amp;#39;t a coincidence-- when we matched she looked me up on LinkedIn and saw that I was Brazilian. Then she waited to tell me until we&amp;#39;d talked more and gotten closer. I guess that was a red flag. I don&amp;#39;t know what to take way from this. I&amp;#39;ve been in situations before where I caught feelings for the other person and deep down I knew they didn&amp;#39;t feel the same. Like no matter what I said outwardly I knew my feelings weren&amp;#39;t fully reciprocated. But this is the first time it&amp;#39;s happened with someone I was convinced felt the same. Who by all outward appearances was at least interested in giving it a shot with me. I don&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;m going to do at this point, because I&amp;#39;m so suggestible and have imposter syndrome I&amp;#39;m convinced that there&amp;#39;s something wrong with me and no matter how good of a fit the next person seems it will end the same way. I actually don&amp;#39;t think there is anyone who is a good fit for me anymore. Every woman who has rung that bell ended up changing her mind. It&amp;#39;s happened three or four times now at varying stages of dating. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: we talked about what happened on the phone, and she made it seem like what happened was a funny little mishap, like it was so silly I would even ask about it. I feel worse than I ever thought I could feel.  I have severe depression and anxiety issues in addition to the ADHD and I don&amp;#39;t see a way out of this for me without a drastic personality change and that&amp;#39;s not going to happen. I feel humiliated, pathetic, stupid, unwanted, gullible, and violated. And I have to go through this completely alone, trapped inside my house in the dead of winter. I give up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ORIGINAL POST:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll try to keep this short. Right now I&amp;#39;m more heart broken I think than I&amp;#39;ve ever been. I met someone a few weeks ago, I&amp;#39;ll call her C,  and when I say it felt like we were made for each other I mean it. Before I met her I was in a relationship for eight months and I felt closer to C in two weeks than I ever did with my ex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has happened before and it&amp;#39;s always ended with me getting hurt. But in the past there was something I could pin point that at least gave me some clarity on what went wrong.

I went to an alternative high school my last year (2012) and I fell into a friend group that prioritized having fun over school, and my grades showed it.

88,,ADHD,"I’ve been taking adderall for close to two months now, absolute life changer and it’s been great. The only people that know my diagnosis is my mom, my sister, and my partner. It’s not something I actively hide, but I’m generally a very private person, so I wouldn’t talk about it unless someone asked. 

Just for reference, parents are divorced and my dad lives in a different state, so I don’t see him or talk to him super often. We’ve had a rocky relationship in the past but honestly it’s gotten so much better over the years, and it vastly improved when my parents separated. 

I think the reason I’m scared is because from the ages of about 15-18 I dealt with really severe depression and anxiety/panic attacks, and he didn’t handle it well. His only concern were my grades, not so much my well being. He was anti-therapist and anti-medication, I don’t really know why. When I started on anti-depressants he made me read all this info about all the negative side effects and what horrible long term effects I could have. It was rough and my mom tried to protect me from him the best she could. 

But that was 7+ years ago, and like I said our relationship has improved and I like to think he’s gotten more tolerant of mental health issues. I certainly don’t need to tell him about my diagnosis or medication, but he’s my dad and a big part of me wants him to know. I guess I’m just scared of the reaction. 

I called him yesterday just to chat, and I had every intention of bringing it up but then I just couldn’t. I’m considering bringing it up next time he comes to see me in person, I just don’t know if I’ll be able to. He might also be hurt that I’ve kept it from him.

92,,ADHD,"I always hear about others with ADHD having specific interest that they connect with or constant go back to, but I feel the opposite. While yes I have interest and hobbies I often feel I have to pretend that they are as important to me as others do. Almost like I’m mirroring their excitement for the things they deeply enjoy with things I just kinda like. The same goes for hobbies I might like something like music or doing an activity and then I see someone with the same interest and I’m like “wow they are really into this thing like they really enjoy it and honestly I like it but I could live without it”. It’s not quite imposter symptom because I don’t feel like a poser I am more just upset that I can’t like something with as much passion as they do. 

An example is I know a lot of ppl who can watch the same movie/show over and over again because it’s their favorite, but I really can’t do that. No matter how much I like a show I rarely will rewatch it unless it’s with someone else or there has been enough time for me to forget it. Sometimes I will be into a certain thing but at most it will last a week then I never pick it up again and when ppl talk about it I might know about it, but I have no interest in relating to them about the topic. In general I feel like I only bring up my “interests” because people are suppose to have them. 

A lot of this might be because I never have the energy to dive into anything and instead just skim the surface of everything I enjoy. I deal with other disorders as well and this could be related to them instead, but I do really feel this is related to my ADHD.

96,,ADHD,"It’s so demotivating. I was so proud of myself because I’ve been able to get work done using some 10 minute YouTube video ADHD timers and listening to loud music. I also have been gamifying tasks (can you finish writing that email before this song ends?). And so far, it has actually worked! I’m getting things done and I’m excited about it.

All this effort, all this conscious research to improve myself to fit in with the neurotypical expectations... yet no one really expects me to do well anymore. I don’t get a thank you at work for going the extra mile today. My boss worries that I can’t finish this or can’t take on that. She doesn’t want me to do anything I am actually excited to do in fear that I might not finish on time or get overwhelmed.

* He decides to pay out of pocket for full script this time, with GoodRX, to avoid complications
* **Polite** pharmacist then recommends that his doctor send in two separate scripts next time: 2x30mg and 1x30mg. That way at least 2/3 is covered and 1/3 out of pocket. Cool! Super helpful\~
* Next appointment, his doctor recommends the same thing the pharmacist said, independently.
* Doctor sends in two scripts. He picks up first 2/3 of script (2x30mg)
* 4 days later, CVS sends ""ready for pickup"" notification to his app for remaining third. (1x30mg) 
* He calls before heading out, just to double check before driving up.
* **Rude** Pharmacist *decides* she can't authorize it, even though it was ""ready for pickup/filled"". She was really not having it, you could hear it in her voice.
* He explains the situation, points out last month's dose of 3x30mg to show her that this was indeed intentional, and she doesn't care, says his doctor did it wrong, *no he didn't hun*. **The doctor ordered this.** 
* He stated that he's only going by what the doctor and pharmacist said was the best way to go about this. 
* She calls him a liar, essentially, and that no pharmacist said to do that. *(Yes she did. I was there.)*
* She said he can't receive any more for next 30 days. 
* I know for a fact that there is nothing stopping them from allowing him to pay out of pocket.

&lt;p&gt;Eating is a challenge. I get a stomachache anytime I eat anything, even just a few bites. But I&amp;#39;ve been making myself eat as much as I possibly can. I haven&amp;#39;t been exercising, and I haven&amp;#39;t made any lifestyle changes. So, I have to assume these are due to my medication.&lt;/p&gt;

107,,ADHD,"TL;DR at the end.

I don't have a super hard time remembering appointments/meetings/dates, but I am constantly forgetting to bring things I need with me. I'd say 3/5 work days, I have to go back into the house at least 2, if not 3 times to get something I've forgotten. Sometimes I'm already driving and have to turn around. Commonly forgotten items: laptop, lunch, phone, wallet, charger, work badge, watch, notebook, coffee cup. I also leave a lot of these things at work by mistake. I'll get to the parking lot or get home and realize I left my charger plugged in or left my coffee thermos on my desk.

It is so exhausting to constantly have to go back and forth because I've forgotten something. My boyfriend gets kind of frustrated when it takes me 3 tries to actually leave the house because I have to keep going back in. Also, forgetting my wallet kills me. Sometimes it is on my desk at home because I bought something online, or I changed bags and forget to switch it over. It is so embarrassing to go get food with people and realize I've forgotten my wallet. Or worse. The grocery store with a cart full of groceries... so humiliating.

People tell me to put a checklist on my door, but I am only ever thinking about that when I'm in the middle of going back to get something, and I'm already late and flustered at that point. Also, I tried putting a note on my office door reminding me to grab my charger but at this point the note is just part of the wall and I forget it exists.

I picked up a few tools from my time actively participating in a Buddhist group that greatly helped me manage my rejection sensitivity. As rejection sensitivity is fairly prevalent amongst individuals with ADHD, I thought I would share it here in the hopes that it might help someone else.

Am I actually being rejected or is my brain being a fuck?

If I did something wrong or that hurt this person, what can I do in the future to try and prevent this from happening again? (also apologize for doing whatever it was that you did. Do not try to explain the why unless it is extremely necessary, like did the right thing for their safety but still hurt them, so that they are aware of the danger. Otherwise leave it at hey I did this thing and I recognize that it hurt you and I'm sorry.) You can sometimes follow this up with a conversation with the person where you agree on techniques that may help mitigate this thing happening again in the future as often times these things tend to be caused by misunderstandings in communication.

118,,ADHD,"Hey yall, so I recently just got back on vyvance after taking about 2 years off. When I was first prescribed I was dosed at 30mg and it worked wonders for me, didn’t have to raise dose ever and in many cases I cracked open the capsule and did a half dose instead of a full 30. 

ANYWAY. I just got prescribed again but at a 20mg dose. Knowing about my prior use, I thought this was going to be a perfect dose plus I haven’t been on an stimulant for 2 years so I I’d assume my body would be refreshed......

NOPE, after taking my first dose I felt it, but definitely not like I once experienced before, the next day I tried again and it only lasted for 3-4 hours???? I’m just so confused and frustrated because this was the best ADHD med I’ve tried.

120,,ADHD,"TL;DR - Didn't have ADHD meds due to pharmacy error and poor planning on my end so I was without meds for a week. This happened to be the same week my midterm had been rescheduled to and because I haddn't been checking my e-mails or going to online lectures I ended up missing the entire midterm.

Could really use some advice. I've been doing ok-ish in this class, the professor is really difficult and sets a lot of high expectations (none of them are unreasonable I'm just having a hard time keeping up) and I just realized that the midterm I thought was today was actually last week.

I really can't stand online classes anymore, its so easy to just skip the lectures and say ""eh I'll watch it later"" and then realize that one you skipped had vital information on the rescheduling of your midterm from one date to another.

Not only this but because I haven't had any classes in person its been even more difficult for me to form any connections with my peers in this course who could have told me that the midterm was moved.

I know this all just sounds like me feeling sorry for myself, and i guess it is, but I'm just trying not to lose my mind thinking about how I just wasted my parents money for this entire semester since that midterm was about 25% of my grade.

I also posted this on r/CasualConversation, but what I didn't say in that post is that this midterm happened at the worst possible moment. We had  a huge winter storm and all classes were closed for the entire week due to power outages. This set our schedule back a week and as such this set the midterm back.

Then, the following week, I run out of my ADHD medication. I ask to get it refilled and it takes the pharmacy ***an entire damn week*** to refill the prescription. In hindsight I really should have put the order in ***before*** I ran out but it is what it is. So I was without my prescription for all of last week which ruined my sleep schedule and my normal organization system.

Thus I missed a bunch of lectures and e-mails all of which would have told me that the midterm date had been moved.

And so here I find myself, 4 days away from spring break wondering how I'm going to tell my parents that I missed an entire midterm due to my own incompetence.

The reason why I didn't say any of this in r/CasualConversation is because I don't want people to think I'm trying to blame this all on my ADHD. Honestly I don't know where to place the blame for this, it all just seems to be like the perfect storm.",t2_16wxb1,False,,0,False,"Just realized the midterm I thought was today was actually last week and I didn't even realize it, tell me why I shouldn't be losing my mind",[],r/ADHD,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_m28ui5,False,dark,0.75,#cbf0ec,public,2,0,{},,9e6bf1d6-0cb2-11e5-9630-0e7ddae6ef03,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1615439865.0,text,0,,,text,self.ADHD,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TL;DR - Didn&amp;#39;t have ADHD meds due to pharmacy error and poor planning on my end so I was without meds for a week.

&lt;p&gt;Not only this but because I haven&amp;#39;t had any classes in person its been even more difficult for me to form any connections with my peers in this course who could have told me that the midterm was moved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this all just sounds like me feeling sorry for myself, and i guess it is, but I&amp;#39;m just trying not to lose my mind thinking about how I just wasted my parents money for this entire semester since that midterm was about 25% of my grade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also posted this on &lt;a href=""/r/CasualConversation""&gt;r/CasualConversation&lt;/a&gt;, but what I didn&amp;#39;t say in that post is that this midterm happened at the worst possible moment. We had  a huge winter storm and all classes were closed for the entire week due to power outages. This set our schedule back a week and as such this set the midterm back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, the following week, I run out of my ADHD medication. I ask to get it refilled and it takes the pharmacy &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;an entire damn week&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to refill the prescription. In hindsight I really should have put the order in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I ran out but it is what it is. So I was without my prescription for all of last week which ruined my sleep schedule and my normal organization system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus I missed a bunch of lectures and e-mails all of which would have told me that the midterm date had been moved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so here I find myself, 4 days away from spring break wondering how I&amp;#39;m going to tell my parents that I missed an entire midterm due to my own incompetence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why I didn&amp;#39;t say any of this in &lt;a href=""/r/CasualConversation""&gt;r/CasualConversation&lt;/a&gt; is because I don&amp;#39;t want people to think I&amp;#39;m trying to blame this all on my ADHD. Honestly I don&amp;#39;t know where to place the blame for this, it all just seems to be like the perfect storm.&lt;/p&gt;

121,,ADHD,"Not looking for a diagnosis (have an appointment for that on Monday) but currently fixating on the idea I might have add and am looking for another opinion. 

To start, I should mention I am 26f, diagnosed depression/anxiety and have been taking Zoloft for the past 6 months which has all but annihilated my anxiety/depression and with that my ability to focus/get things done. I had assumed most of my problems were related to these things. That is when I came to the idea I might have ADD inattentive type. 

I’ve always been quiet, introverted, and socially anxious. As a kid I was the top of my class in school, did well on tests, and turned in homework on time. I didn’t speak in class/was well behaved, other than daydreaming in class a lot. I did forget my homework/other things quite often, and felt like I had to study harder/longer than others to be successful. I procrastinated but got things done, often the night before it was due. I had MAJOR anxiety around school in elementary/middle/high school, to the point I would cry if I got anything less than a B. So I was always able to push myself to do homework and study. 

Friendships were mostly fine, however I had a hard time maintaining them unless I saw my friends in person. After school I preferred to play video games instead of hang out with other kids. Often, during school breaks/weekends, I would play video games all day for days at a time, or read books like Harry Potter straight through until I finished them. 

I’ve always been an “airhead”, organized chaos in my bedroom and forgetful/losing important things. I have trouble organizing myself and my thoughts, and telling stories. I have considered it part of my personality. 

I also play with my hair constantly, and bite my cheeks. In situations where I’m bored, like church or a work meeting, I feel an intense need to be done and go move around, always looking at the clock. 

In college, I completely fell apart academically. I took an extra year, and did poorly on most assignments since I never could pay attention in class. Without structure, I couldn’t get myself to study or pay attention in class. Ever. I started every semester with motivation to take notes each lecture and start assignments early but could only do that for the first week. My grades heavily depended on acing final exams. I would study for hours in the library but spent most of the time browsing the Internet or talking to friends. 

As an employee today, I feel the same way. Unless there is an imminent deadline I procrastinate on my work and cannot pay attention in meetings or 1:1s with my manager. At home, I am struggling with my boyfriend being very neat and clean and I need to have things out where I will remember them. I forget things a lot when I’m leaving the house and I can’t keep in touch with friends long distance as I forget about their existence. 

Additionally, I fixate on ideas for weeks at a time. One moment it’s skiing, the next it’s changing my hair, or buying stocks. I impulsively spend on things relating to my current fixation. Once I accomplish or receive whatever it is, I move on to something else. I’ve lost control of my spending as an adult. 

I think the fact that I was successful in school before age 12 (and my parents/teachers/friends can corroborate that) might be an indicator that I don’t have it? I seem to have a lot of the symptoms and reading others’ stories on here makes me feel heard. But I am really struggling as an adult and really need help.

Edit: tldr; i am struggling as an adult from what I thought was anxiety/depression, but I have fixed that and I identify with inattentive ADHD.

My psychiatrist and I are 90% sure that i have adhd. Since I was a kindergartener my mom used to tell me to stop staring out the window off into the distance daydreaming. I almost always pace around the subway platform while I wait for the train and tap my foot at blast beat speeds in class and at home.

136,,ADHD,"I have not been officially diagnosed with ADHD but I have always had problems with procrastination, starting tasks, staying focused, etc. as well as with excessive daytime sleepiness. I have started uni this year and those things have been making my life much more difficult. After multiple attempts to deal with those problems without any medication, my psychiatrist prescribed me 20g of Medikinet (methylphenidate hydrochloride) which is often used to help people with ADHD. I am going to be honest, I was a bit concerned at first about the side effects, becoming dependent, and all that stuff. 

But holy crap, after taking the drug I felt so much better. My head was clear and I was actually able to focus on what I needed to do. I have also noticed that it helped with my anxiety and overthinking, which allowed me to be more social in certain situations. Since then I have been taking the pills on days I knew I was going to need to be productive and stay focused and it has been working out fine.

Now it has been a couple of months since I have been prescribed the meds and I have noticed that their effects are way weaker than before or sometimes even negligible. My thoughts run ramped just as much as before, staying on track is difficult and what's worse is that I have had situations when I felt sleepy after taking the drug, which is the main thing that it was supposed to help me with. Honestly, I'm kinda worried about it because the meds have really helped and allowed me to feel a bit more ""normal"" I guess.

&lt;p&gt;But holy crap, after taking the drug I felt so much better. My head was clear and I was actually able to focus on what I needed to do. I have also noticed that it helped with my anxiety and overthinking, which allowed me to be more social in certain situations. Since then I have been taking the pills on days I knew I was going to need to be productive and stay focused and it has been working out fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it has been a couple of months since I have been prescribed the meds and I have noticed that their effects are way weaker than before or sometimes even negligible. My thoughts run ramped just as much as before, staying on track is difficult and what&amp;#39;s worse is that I have had situations when I felt sleepy after taking the drug, which is the main thing that it was supposed to help me with. Honestly, I&amp;#39;m kinda worried about it because the meds have really helped and allowed me to feel a bit more &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; I guess. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR The medication prescribed to people with ADHD, that has also helped me a lot, has stopped working as it did at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does somebody know what may be the reason for that? And do you have any tips or advice on how to deal with this issue?&lt;/p&gt;

Fuck I hate this feeling. I have known i have ADHD for about 7 years now. But I've always thought it was just mild or very light. Only when i discovered this sub and r/adhdmeme i started to grasp how bad it was. That was in the middle of 2019.

Since then I started to try a lot of coping strategies, try to understand my own head, and in general, try to treat it on my own. When i realized I couldn't and it was only getting worse i asked for my mom's help. She managed to get me to a therapist and my therapist was awesome! She helped a lot to understand who I was and what is adhd and that it is a part of me and not some other thing. But ever since the start she said that as soon as I could i should go to a psychiatrist. 

Well it took a long time, but after I insisted a lot my mom managed to get me there too. Yesterday I was diagnosed officially and got my prescription. Today I got my pills. 

I am yet to take any, but everyone that i talked about it, friends, family, everybody answer to me like I was going to use crack or something just because I want to take ""the easy route"" like I was going after some happy pills i didn't need because big pharma told me to.

I tried making those planners and such but i kept forgetting to put things in them, I tried talking to you for god sake but you wouldn't listen and just shut me down.

143,,ADHD,"Warning: This is long, but I broke it down in bullets to make it easier to read. You can delete if it's too much.

So, I've been for two sessions, finishing my second yesterday and have to wait maybe 2 weeks for the results. The first session was going over my history from childhood to adulthood. It was pretty long and in depth and made me second guess myself to the extreme since I don't really remember having too many defining symptoms as a kid. My teenage/high school years are a blur of depression, trouble making, a few misdiagnoses, and being overly medicated to the point where I was asleep most of the time and my memory is shot. I didn't end up going the conventional route in school since I really couldn't but still got my GED a year before my class graduated and was able to get my diploma through a special program as long as I worked until my class graduated. 

Anyway, it brought up a lot of emotions. After the grueling questioning, I had to take a test on the computer where letters would pop up on a stark white screen in different intervals and I had to press the space bar every time they popped up except for the letter ""X"". The screen was so white I had to look more at the bottom of the screen and look out of my peripherals. It was interesting and very boring. He gave me some other tests to take home and fill out. PAI test(?) and another questionnaire asking me questions about how I view myself, parents, peers, emotions. That one was kind of dark but I can see how useful it could be. I told him it was stressful fill out. The way he explained it made me think maybe I would also be getting some more general mental diagnosis for problems I have. That would be very helpful. 

I went in yesterday for my second session. It was maybe 3 hours of testing and I was so exhausted and drained afterwards. I'm pretty sure these aren't in order of how they were given.

1st- I had red/white blocks with the different sides either being one color or both split. With those I had to reproduce the shape on the paper in a certain amount of time. Pretty easy as I am a visual person. I missed the last one though, almost had it. I stared at the paper for a second after knowing I could have/should have gotten it. \*Brain cues anxiety\*

2nd- I had to repeat the numbers he said to me in order it was said. Then in hierarchy from 0-9. I closed my eyes to visualize which helped quite a bit. Also tapped my fingers to recall which number was said with what finger I tapped. Maybe a few I blanked on. When my anxiety kicks in it sometimes my thoughts are like a marker on a dry erase board. It's blank again with a quick swipe.

3rd- He read two words and I had to describe the similarities in them. I got most but a few I just couldn't express them in words. I understand how they are similar, I just couldn't say it. \*Down we go again\*. 

4th- I had to define words, same thing. \*Dumb dumb, why can't you find your words? You know exactly what they mean and how to use them.\* 

5th- I had to find the pattern in different shapes and color formations with with one tile being blank to fill in with the options below. The more intricate ones were very hard to focus on to find the pattern. Again, visual person, why can't I get this? The time, the pressure, my anxiety. I made the best guesses on some and made it obvious I was guessing. 

6th-I was given two shapes that were different colors. Below, were probably 10 or so lines with the two shapes and two colors. I had to mark the ones that were the same as the two examples given as fast as I could until he said stop. I accidentally marked a few wrong and I know I missed a few. A couple I realized I missed as soon as a passed them and marked after. Calling myself dumb under my breathe as I mess up. With the mask on, I'm not sure if he heard me or not. We did that a few different times. 

7th- I was given the numbers 0-9 with a shape or lines being underneath. There were probably at least 20 lines of numbers with a fill in the blank box underneath to fill in the shape associated with the number. Again, as fast as a could. I don't know how I did. There was an arrow pointing upwards for one and I kept accidentally writing an A on impulse. Same with maybe one or two others. But, for the most part I think I did okay. 

8th- Mathematical word problem with no scratch paper. Not fantastic at math but none of them were very hard. But again, I didn't have a piece of paper to write the numbers down. I can do the math in my head. I just needed paper to keep the numbers straight for the multi step ones. He was allowed to repeat them once which was nice. I flubbed a few times when I got nervous and couldn't keep the math straight in my head. There was also someone talking outside the office and I would lose any train of thought. I finally said something. Felt like an idiot. They give these questions to kids I assume. 

9th- This might have been the final one. He would say numbers and letters which I would have to repeat but put the in order starting with the letters and followed by the numbers, A-Z 0-9. Finger taps again and eyes closed. The more intricate ones I'm pretty sure I flubbed.

To be honest, I was almost in tears through a lot of it. I could feel my eyes start to water and worked hard to keep it in check. I don't like feeling like an idiot and I'm really hard on myself. I get sensitive when I'm wrong. Especially if I know I could have gotten the answer. I went to my favorite bar with my favorite bartender and had a shot and a beer to ease the nerves before going home. I just didn't want to be alone with my thought quite yet. When I got home and my husband got done with work we talked and I just started ugly crying and hyperventilating. I just felt so f\*\*\*ing stupid and I apologized so many times to him for being so stupid and everything else I do to make his life harder. It was hard to even look him in the eyes. I don't think I did the entire time. I kept covering my face with my blanket so he couldn't look at me. I didn't want to be looked at. He calmed me down and made me lay on the couch and I took an anxiety/allergy pill to make me sleepy. I realize that I'm very anxious and hard on myself. But, did anyone else feel this way? I would hope not everyone goes through this after the test. Maybe I don't have adhd and I'm just anxious and dumb.

After the grueling questioning, I had to take a test on the computer where letters would pop up on a stark white screen in different intervals and I had to press the space bar every time they popped up except for the letter &amp;quot;X&amp;quot;. The screen was so white I had to look more at the bottom of the screen and look out of my peripherals. It was interesting and very boring. He gave me some other tests to take home and fill out. PAI test(?) and another questionnaire asking me questions about how I view myself, parents, peers, emotions. That one was kind of dark but I can see how useful it could be. I told him it was stressful fill out. The way he explained it made me think maybe I would also be getting some more general mental diagnosis for problems I have. That would be very helpful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went in yesterday for my second session. It was maybe 3 hours of testing and I was so exhausted and drained afterwards. I&amp;#39;m pretty sure these aren&amp;#39;t in order of how they were given.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1st- I had red/white blocks with the different sides either being one color or both split. With those I had to reproduce the shape on the paper in a certain amount of time. Pretty easy as I am a visual person. I missed the last one though, almost had it. I stared at the paper for a second after knowing I could have/should have gotten it. *Brain cues anxiety*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2nd- I had to repeat the numbers he said to me in order it was said. Then in hierarchy from 0-9. I closed my eyes to visualize which helped quite a bit. Also tapped my fingers to recall which number was said with what finger I tapped. Maybe a few I blanked on. When my anxiety kicks in it sometimes my thoughts are like a marker on a dry erase board. It&amp;#39;s blank again with a quick swipe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3rd- He read two words and I had to describe the similarities in them. I got most but a few I just couldn&amp;#39;t express them in words. I understand how they are similar, I just couldn&amp;#39;t say it. *Down we go again*. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4th- I had to define words, same thing. *Dumb dumb, why can&amp;#39;t you find your words? You know exactly what they mean and how to use them.* &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5th- I had to find the pattern in different shapes and color formations with with one tile being blank to fill in with the options below. The more intricate ones were very hard to focus on to find the pattern. Again, visual person, why can&amp;#39;t I get this? The time, the pressure, my anxiety. I made the best guesses on some and made it obvious I was guessing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6th-I was given two shapes that were different colors. Below, were probably 10 or so lines with the two shapes and two colors. I had to mark the ones that were the same as the two examples given as fast as I could until he said stop. I accidentally marked a few wrong and I know I missed a few. A couple I realized I missed as soon as a passed them and marked after. Calling myself dumb under my breathe as I mess up. With the mask on, I&amp;#39;m not sure if he heard me or not. We did that a few different times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7th- I was given the numbers 0-9 with a shape or lines being underneath. There were probably at least 20 lines of numbers with a fill in the blank box underneath to fill in the shape associated with the number. Again, as fast as a could. I don&amp;#39;t know how I did. There was an arrow pointing upwards for one and I kept accidentally writing an A on impulse. Same with maybe one or two others. But, for the most part I think I did okay. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8th- Mathematical word problem with no scratch paper. Not fantastic at math but none of them were very hard. But again, I didn&amp;#39;t have a piece of paper to write the numbers down. I can do the math in my head. I just needed paper to keep the numbers straight for the multi step ones. He was allowed to repeat them once which was nice. I flubbed a few times when I got nervous and couldn&amp;#39;t keep the math straight in my head. There was also someone talking outside the office and I would lose any train of thought. I finally said something. Felt like an idiot. They give these questions to kids I assume. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9th- This might have been the final one. He would say numbers and letters which I would have to repeat but put the in order starting with the letters and followed by the numbers, A-Z 0-9. Finger taps again and eyes closed. The more intricate ones I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I flubbed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I was almost in tears through a lot of it. I could feel my eyes start to water and worked hard to keep it in check. I don&amp;#39;t like feeling like an idiot and I&amp;#39;m really hard on myself. I get sensitive when I&amp;#39;m wrong. Especially if I know I could have gotten the answer. I went to my favorite bar with my favorite bartender and had a shot and a beer to ease the nerves before going home. I just didn&amp;#39;t want to be alone with my thought quite yet. When I got home and my husband got done with work we talked and I just started ugly crying and hyperventilating. I just felt so f***ing stupid and I apologized so many times to him for being so stupid and everything else I do to make his life harder. It was hard to even look him in the eyes. I don&amp;#39;t think I did the entire time. I kept covering my face with my blanket so he couldn&amp;#39;t look at me. I didn&amp;#39;t want to be looked at. He calmed me down and made me lay on the couch and I took an anxiety/allergy pill to make me sleepy. I realize that I&amp;#39;m very anxious and hard on myself. But, did anyone else feel this way? I would hope not everyone goes through this after the test. Maybe I don&amp;#39;t have adhd and I&amp;#39;m just anxious and dumb. Again, Sorry this was so long and I commend anyone who got through this cluster f***.&lt;/p&gt;

146,,ADHD,"I've been on Ritalin for a year now. On the standard version from 5mg all the way to 20mg, then on the modified release version starting with 20mg and now 30mg.

The thing is I've been building resistance to it very quickly. It got slower with higher dosages but remains an issue. The 30mg would work for 7h for the first month, but over time it became 5h, then 3h and finally something around 1h40.

Because of this my doctor wants to add some emotion regulators to me treatment. So that I can feel better on the days I don't need to work/focus and so that I use the Ritalin less often and stop building resistance (I'm not a fan of his approach, he thinks that meds should only be taken when I need to work, so I've been heavily insisting that it's only half the problem).

But where will I be in another year or 2? It's pretty obvious that I'll keep building more and more resistance to the substance and will need more for it to get the same results. And the same probably goes for the regulators.

So how is this issue resolved? (Specifically in countries where only one type of medication is available?)

156,,ADHD,"So I've finally started taking ADHD medication for the past month. I have an appointment with my doctor today and have plenty of questions to ask.

First of all, it seems to work. I can focus on mundane tasks, and at the same I don't feel the urge to abandon hard tasks. It allows me to have a fully productive workday, and that's exactly what I asked for.

But then there are the issues.

First, it gets me a little ""cloudy"" and agitated (shaking legs, some strange body sensations, some difficulty reading) for a bit before the calming effects get noticeable. Is this normal? Like, I take 20mg Ritalin LA at 10am, and will feel a little agitated until around 10h45, when I'll start feel calm and focused. By 11am, after I'm completely focused at work, it goes away. By 1pm it's the perfect spot. I feel like a normal, capable human being. No rushes, no shaking legs, no strange body sensations, just peaceful. Could this be because the dosage is high or low? I don't remember feeling that on Ritalin IR, but I felt it throughout the days when I took only 10mg of Ritalin LA. After upping to 20mg, now I only feel it at the beginning like I described.

Second, I already had IBS, and Ritalin seems to make it so much worse. From what I've read, it seems like my body isn't processing fat properly: feces get yellowish, and there's a bit of ""oil/fat"" in there too. Having a stricter diet, reducing carbs and eating more fiber (fruits, vegetables, etc) seem to fix this, but I just couldn't gather enough data to know for sure if it's a definite solution or not (I also have no way to guarantee that I'll be able to keep a healthy diet in the future, some times we have to go through bread and rice for some days because we have no time to do groceries).

Third is the crash. Holy shit, the crash is though. It starts at around 4pm and it feels unbearable. My body hurts, my muscles feel tense, I can't focus on anything, I get sad, fatigued and unmotivated. Talking a walk helps a bit, laying still in a dark room, eating something, etc. These all help to an extent, but don't fix it completely. I've not managed to take a nap because I feel like if I'll end up sleeping too much and then will be unable to sleep at bedtime.

The problem with the crash is mostly in days I have appointments or chores around that time. If I'm in a meeting I just feel like a useless, dumb cabbage, unable to process anything or contribute to anything. I don't even feel like playing video games with the kids because I'm irritated and don't want them to feel the bad vibes. The other day I was in a ""tough conversation"" with my boss when it started and I can only imagined what it might have looked like to her to see me going from 100 to 0 in half an hour. Until now I have avoided taking it the days I have therapy because I don't want to go there in the middle of a crash. Today I took it even though I have my doctors appointment later, and I think it'll be fun to talk to him like this.

The doc said I could try taking a IR pill to push the crash a little bit later and it does work, but makes the delayed crash more intense, and I feel like a drug abuser or something, taking more of it just to keep the high. I did exactly this yesterday, then crashed from 6h30pm until 8h30pm, had a strange night where I didn't know if I was awake or not, and woke up with sore muscles.

Also if I don't time the IR pill perfectly, I get some nice 30 minutes of weird cloudy shaky feelings (like I described in first point) until it settles in.

So my question to y'all is: is that normal? Will it subside with time? Is the dosage too low or too high? Should I try other medications? Ritalin is cheap and manageable (I can time LA + IR usage), I haven't tried Concerta, Vyvanse is too expensive and that's about all the options my doc gave me.",t2_k00fc,False,,0,False,"Finally prescribed ADHD medication, have some questions",[],r/ADHD,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_m1zew1,False,light,0.81,,public,3,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Questions/Advice/Support,False,3,,False,self,1615388708.0,,[],{},,True,,1615417302.0,text,0,,,text,self.ADHD,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ve finally started taking ADHD medication for the past month.

158,,ADHD,"\[20 y/o M\]

Hi all, recently got my ADHD diagnosis and was excited to head to a psychiatrist and start medication. Beforehand, I obsessively researched a lot of medications like Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse, Concerta.

After I discussed my symptoms and diagnosis with my psychiatrist, she decided to prescribe me Strattera. I didn't even know what that was, but I assumed it was something similar to Vyvanse because she said it was a less addictive medication than something like Adderall.

After the meeting ended (because she really didn't give me any time to ask questions), I went ahead and researched Strattera and... I'm just so confused. Everywhere I look says it is only supposed to be a second-line medication if stimulants don't work. And it takes about a month for it to start working? And there are hundreds of side effects especially during that first month? And it's significantly less effective at treating ADHD than stimulants?

I don't know, I was just so confused. I'm literally not going to fill that prescription because I honestly don't want it. I'm in school right now and I have too much going own to afford a whole bunch of side effects for a month.

What should I do? Just get a new psychiatrist? I'm really bummed out because I had to wait a whole month to meet with that one.

Applied to hundreds of jobs, took several interviews and took too many rejections. My interviewing skills suffered because of my ADHD. Fidgeting, stuttering (and saying ummm... A LOT) twitching, scanning the room constantly instead of making eye contact, mind wandering and being unable to recall information on the spot (even after countless rehearsals) were just a few of the symptoms that held me back. Before I got diagnosed I got very close to landing a job at home depot, and they even interviewed me 3 times basically telling me I had the job, and then boom, no contact for weeks until I recieved an email telling me I was rejected. If that didn't make me feel unemployable, I don't know what would. 

But since I got diagnosed back in January and getting on the right medication, I was able to fix a lot of these problems! Not all, but a lot of them. I got my first interview since my diagnosis and I ACED IT! They contacted me the next day, and the next thing I knew I was signing the job offer and began online training. I couldn't be happier!

164,,ADHD,"I (24F) got a referral from my GP last year as I was struggling and needed help. He referred me (as he did a questionnaire and said it's most likely I have ADD) to the Primary Care Team who assess and diagnose ADD/ADHD. I finally got to see the psychiatrist (60s?F) today after a few months wait. She went through my whole childhood with myself and my mother. I have a LOT of traits from ADHD (hyper focus, spacing out, terrible memory, forgetting how to form sentences, picking up hobbies and leaving them, impulsiveness, talking over people/ending their sentence, constant need to fidget, can't carry out simple instructions, unable to listen or take in words, losing my possessions, careless mistakes/reading over stuff, easily distracted and cannot focus in conversations, excessive talking) that are making my life a train wreck and I opened up and told her everything, showed her my notes, told her about how I had a bad time in education and doing daily tasks.

The reasons she said I don't have ADHD are:

* I was not bouncing off the wall when I was a child, like most boys (I was quiet and reserved) and kept comparing me to my male cousin with ADHD.
* I had friends and socialised (I was the quiet one who just listened to everyone and usually then just stopped talking to them, failed to keep up social relationships).
* I got through education and I'm now doing a difficult course (I had the worst attendance through Primary and Secondary School, barely passing my GCSEs and dropping out during A-Levels. I'm now going into Final Year in University this September and I have struggled the whole way through).
* I have generalised anxiety disorder so there's no way it can be ADHD (My anxiety is situational and usually only when I'm travelling or it's something unknown and unfamiliar so it doesn't stay around on a daily basis).

She seems to think because I have GAD, my mind is over-working and it's leading to the same traits as ADHD. 

I am suffering **every day** and University has made it more prevalent. My two closes female friends along with my dad seem to think I need a second opinion from someone who specialises in female ADHD. I really hate how the only characteristics they ever consider is hyperactivity and have bad grades from education. Should I get a second opinion or go private? I'm feeling so hopeless after that appointment.

**TL;DR** Mature doctor compared my childhood to boys and hyperactivity. Says I can't have ADHD if I'm smart and have made it this far. Diagnosed me with GAD and says I'm emotionally unstable.

He referred me (as he did a questionnaire and said it&amp;#39;s most likely I have ADD) to the Primary Care Team who assess and diagnose ADD/ADHD. I finally got to see the psychiatrist (60s?F) today after a few months wait. She went through my whole childhood with myself and my mother. I have a LOT of traits from ADHD (hyper focus, spacing out, terrible memory, forgetting how to form sentences, picking up hobbies and leaving them, impulsiveness, talking over people/ending their sentence, constant need to fidget, can&amp;#39;t carry out simple instructions, unable to listen or take in words, losing my possessions, careless mistakes/reading over stuff, easily distracted and cannot focus in conversations, excessive talking) that are making my life a train wreck and I opened up and told her everything, showed her my notes, told her about how I had a bad time in education and doing daily tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons she said I don&amp;#39;t have ADHD are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was not bouncing off the wall when I was a child, like most boys (I was quiet and reserved) and kept comparing me to my male cousin with ADHD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had friends and socialised (I was the quiet one who just listened to everyone and usually then just stopped talking to them, failed to keep up social relationships).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I got through education and I&amp;#39;m now doing a difficult course (I had the worst attendance through Primary and Secondary School, barely passing my GCSEs and dropping out during A-Levels. I&amp;#39;m now going into Final Year in University this September and I have struggled the whole way through).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have generalised anxiety disorder so there&amp;#39;s no way it can be ADHD (My anxiety is situational and usually only when I&amp;#39;m travelling or it&amp;#39;s something unknown and unfamiliar so it doesn&amp;#39;t stay around on a daily basis).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She seems to think because I have GAD, my mind is over-working and it&amp;#39;s leading to the same traits as ADHD. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am suffering &lt;strong&gt;every day&lt;/strong&gt; and University has made it more prevalent. My two closes female friends along with my dad seem to think I need a second opinion from someone who specialises in female ADHD. I really hate how the only characteristics they ever consider is hyperactivity and have bad grades from education. Should I get a second opinion or go private? I&amp;#39;m feeling so hopeless after that appointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; Mature doctor compared my childhood to boys and hyperactivity. Says I can&amp;#39;t have ADHD if I&amp;#39;m smart and have made it this far. Diagnosed me with GAD and says I&amp;#39;m emotionally unstable. Gave me a referral for therapy to control my emotions. What should I do?&lt;/p&gt;

165,,ADHD,"Just a word of warning to everyone just starting their meds. This euphoria you're feeling in your first week or even month isn't going to last. You're high right now because of all the new chemicals that haven't become the norm yet.

This will eventually calm down and that's completely normal, it doesn't mean you need to rush to up your dose or switch meds (I'm not saying don't do these things as recommended by your doc).

Make the most out of this time but don't kick yourself if you're not as productive a month from now when the high is gone and your energy levels get closer to normal.

The more profound effect of the meds will still be there to help you focus and function but feeling the pill kick in like a rocket up your arse won't. The crazy unending motivation to be productive won't either and that's on you to keep up when the high dies down. Use this time to change some of your habits and build a routine that will last.

Another thing to remember as this all normalises in your brain is that you will feel more ADHD than you ever have when you don't take your meds. When you find yourself having forgotten to take your pill or taking a break from it, that isn't how you were before you started your meds, it's all super exaggerated. Brain fog will be 110% cumulonimbus, you'll likely not have the focus to pay attention to a 10 minute youtube video and you may want to eat a planet. Don't start thinking this was how you were before meds and treat the meds like a crutch because that's not what they're there for.

They help with focus and that's all they should do.

If you catch yourself wanting to take more than you should to get that high back then stop and have a long hard think about it before you do because that's a slippery slope to substance abuse.

I've put off getting help for years constantly thinking my mentality is purely situational and that hard work will change it. It never has, I've spent the last few months trying to learn to code Python and it's felt like I've spent the whole time hitting my head off a brick wall. I can't find the motivation to study, to stay engaged and to break down concepts that I struggle to understand. The course I enrolled in moved too fast and my introverted mentality meant that when I struggled I stayed quiet and acted like everything was fine despite me feeling like I was living in a burning house.

Depression and anxiety leave me feeling like I'm in constant ""wait mode"" and the only thing that really drives me is making music. I think it's the ability to constantly alter what you hear and create that keeps me engaged with it. I could literally spend days on end recording and not doing anything else.

All these feelings made me reflect on earlier instances where I've struggled with education and there was a pattern that was pretty clear to me.

I'm waiting to start meds and I can't seem to think about anything else - it needs to hurry up already

I literally have seen my friends start in the same job as me and progress onto great careers, whilst I've dropped out from being unable to cope with a busy office environment and never made it back to the starting line.

I dropped out of uni. I had to retake courses many times, I've qualified in actual careers and yet i'm not doing any of those things... 

The things I have achieved is due to my long term partner who I now realise picks up most of the slack and I know if I was solo again, I would lose it all in an instant as everything would just crumble around me.

Please tell me meds will make my brain clear, quiet, able to store and recall important data,and prioritise simple tasks!

Did anyone else experience a sense of grief over lost potential, accepting that I cannot do better without meds... and frustration that if only someone had said something earlier I wouldn't have had to suffer and struggle for nearly 40 years, and a sense of loss of identity?

170,,ADHD,"I've been on stimulants for over 20 years, although changed to the XR form (adderall) only in the last year. 

Over the past 10 years or so I've been struggling a lot with exhaustion. It's not constant, although I'm rarely high energy per se, but I'll have weeks or months where I struggle with it a lot.

Or is the exhaustion the product of a dopamine deficiency the medication helps with??

I am relatively anxious and reaching out for help is hard. I can't transfer my medical records because i am from country that is not a part of EU, so i am not even sure where i should go first and where to start.

194,,ADHD,"Hey there so I was diagnosed with Inattentive ADHD and Generalized Anxiety Disorder this past November. I’m currently taking a generic Adderall XR (25mg once a day) and it’s been a few weeks now. Before this, I was taking a generic Adderall (10mg twice a day) for nearly a month and before that, I was taking Buproprion (various doses) for several months.

Buproprion definitely helped with GAD but not really for ADHD. I felt a lot more calm but still struggled with motivation and getting things done, among other things. Once I switched to Adderall, nothing seemed to change except for a slight increase in motivation. Now that I’m on XR, I definitely have the energy and excitement to do things — and to actually make them happen. I study/work in the creative industry so it feels good to be on an upward track because my projects used to be super hit or miss. I would come up with these big ideas but my performance couldn’t always deliver on it. Now I feel like I can.

However, I’ve had a lot of crying spells since taking XR (about two weeks ago). They happen almost everyday and seem to be triggered by a negative thought/reflection floating in my head or after acting on a random moment of anger/frustration. I just get super into my head, feel horrible for being this way, and then spiral into some really intense crying. Like I’ve only ever cried this hard after a bad argument or when a loved one passed away. It also feels physically crazy/manic in my head and makes me have suicidal thoughts. I’ve always struggled with this kind of emotional dysregulation but I think XR is making it more frequent and quite strong for how short a crying spell is (1–2 hours), especially triggered over something as little as a thought. I completely go back to normal when I get myself to stop crying but the suicidal thoughts have kinda stayed on my mind. Not that I’m going to act on them anytime soon. It just feels “revealed” to me now that it might be a possible outcome for me in the future, as dark as that sounds, sorry.

I wonder if any of you had similar experiences with Adderall XR? It probably doesn’t help that I’m a big coffee drinker and have had terrible sleeping habits since childhood.

Also, considering my mixed reactions to XR, it makes me wonder if I have bipolar disorder. I can write paragraphs on this and I’ll obviously just need to speak with my psychiatrist but I was wondering if any of you with bipolar disorder realized it after taking stimulants?

196,,ADHD,"I've been struggling with this question but finally got around to posting this because I'm due for a med review in two weeks and I feel like I'm at an impasse.

I apologize for the length of this.

Brief history on my medication.  I have a history of IV drug use and am on methadone maintenance.  I got clean almost 5 years ago and started the process of coming off of it last year.  It's a very long process but I'm halfway there.  I've always struggled with adhd and was on medication for it in high school (ritalin) but that was before my addiction.  It has been pretty difficult to manage with it unmedicated and last year I sought mental health treatment.  I was prescribed vyvanse and am on 30mgs twice a day.  It was affecting my family and I couldn't pay our bills (even though the money was there) because focusing on even logging in was painful.

Present day: I am noticing that even though I'm on this medication, I revert back to my pre medicated behavior in the afternoons.  I am really forgetful and have trouble staying still long enough to finish a task.  It's almost as though the methadone that I take cancels out the positive behaviors that I have in the morning.  

I know that my psychiatrist would ask me what I would like to do and has mentioned adding an extra medication in the afternoon if i feel that i need it but I'm hoping to not have to flood myself with stimulants to combat the sedating effect of the methadone.  Is there anyone that might have any insight on this or a personal experience?

I also need to add that I'm not a relapse risk and I've been in recovery for years.  The circumstances of my life have changed so drastically that illicit drug use just isn't an option anymore.

-Made a “green folder” for anytime. So these are apps of medium potential for wasting time but are enriching like Duolingo. Or ones that actually help me manage ADHD like Forest.

&lt;p&gt;i started concerta last month at the lowest dose. it mostly just made me really sleepy for the first couple of weeks, and after that, it didn’t do much. now i’m taking 38mg, and i feel.. great, actually! i feel a lot sharper than i’ve felt in a long time; my thoughts aren’t constantly racing, and i can actually hold long, meaningful conversations with people. starting new meds has allowed me to get closer with some of my friends because i’m much more present and grounded in the moment, and i’m so, so fucking grateful. i’m still having trouble getting myself to focus on the Right things, and getting past the mental block of Doing Things, but i’m taking it one step at a time, and feeling so much better. &lt;/p&gt;

201,,ADHD,"I take 10mg Adderall. Through process of elimination I went from taking it 2x 4 hours apart to finding that I have to take it 3x 2.5 hours apart to not dip during the day. The 25 minutes it takes to kick in brings it out to about 3 hours of duration before things start heading south again, so this schedule seems to be catching it right on time. Dr agreed I may be metabolizing it quickly. Gave Vyvanse a shot and I didn't notice any change, if anything it triggered a wave of depression. Very doomy feeling. This was how we landed back at Adderall 3x.

Everything I've read states larger doses only hit harder/produce more side effects but will still be metabolized in the same amount of time. This makes sense, but what if you are taking too little?

I seem to have some luck with 12.5mg (as my 3rd dose) lingering around a tad longer but I can't tell for sure - it could be the subtle stacking of just taking 3 doses. I have not tried XR as I'm worried the coating that delays the second bump will dissolve slower than I metabolize the actual Adderall, creating a dip.

204,,ADHD,"I've googled and a lot of websites suggest a lot of the same, I'm gonna assume I'm not the only one that has issues with those general suggestions. So what have you found that works? Have you always done it like that? How have you adjusted your method over time?

In the military I was always told to carry a small notebook for notes and I got used to it. So for school I was always carrying a journal all the time,  so once a week I'd make one page specifically separated in sections by class and in a different color(blue) I'd write down the assignments due in a week and a half and add the due date in red. This has worked for me tough,  I did frequently run into this issue of always forgetting to go back into my journal to see things I needed to do and also this only has worked for school. It's not exactly worked for me for work or for my personal life. 

I think this is because with university you're always constantly doing something so it probably joist never leaves my mind to check it, where as with my personal life it's like I write it down and then like a week or 2 later I'm like oh yes didn't I have to 'the thing' then I re-add it to a new list in my journal and it doesn't happen. With work I find that the hard part is finding some structure. Like in a school you have 4-6 classes each with their often assignments that are constantly happening at the same time and each class almost expects you to put in the same energy into all classes at the same time(at least that's the way it feels to me), but with work itself like you 3 projects but you may have forgotten about one because it wasn't a job that required a lot of time or there wasn't any rush etc. 

How would you guys suggest I edit my time management style to adjust to these things?

I am currently struggling even with university this last semester because I keep forgetting things I need to do. Or I overly focus on one class and forget about the other 4. 

I've been trying to set alarms for every assignment as I get them, and set reminders 1,2, and 3 days out. Tests are 1 weeks, 5, 3, and 1 days. But this is becoming tedious and I'm forgetting to do it. I'm starting to notice 3 out of my 4 teams this semester may think I don't care. But I do, and I'm frustrated. 

 I was considering doing a mix of my journal and my calendar, but again -&gt; tedious. I tried this one website called Zapier (or something like that) so that I could add each assignment to a google sheets and it automatically adds them to my Google calendar, but I don't know if it may be that I don't understand how to set everything up or that it may not be a refined platform yet, but it's not exactly working for me very well. I also did a new google sheet, and pinned it to my chrome, I treated each thing in my life as an action item and when I complete it goes green and is hidden, also has a countdown for each assignment, but again... I keep forgetting to check this and update. 

I learn the platform a bit better, but I don't want to spend a whole day or 2 figuring it out right now. Maybe in the future. But right now every day is too busy to dedicate to learning this.

I had an intense couple of days at work (Occupational Therapy). It's always busy but the particular combination of working with patients and other staff, getting excited about patients' progress, and coming up with ideas and solutions - has been really intense and varied.

209,,ADHD,"How has medication helped you in your romantic relationships, or relationships in general? Give me some hope.

Hi all!

I have an appointment at a psych for medication management with a psych on April 1st so that I can get back on ADHD medication (I was diagnosed as a child) 

As a child, hyperactivity was the big challenge for me. I couldn’t sit still. I was constantly falling out of my seat at school. I couldn’t focus. My thoughts we’re all over the place. My mom told me my medication made a night and day difference—you could see it in my eyes lol

Now, the big challenge is finding the energy to do stuff and emotional regulation. My emotional regulation has been shit since high school. It’s gotten a little better, but it’s still bad. I hyperfocus on relationships with a single person and then almost cast them aside when someone better in my eyes comes along.

I...

- obsess over them texting me and me replying to them. Seriously. I would miss out on activities and going places because I was so afraid to miss replying to them.

- fear bringing up any sort of boundary or starting any fights in fear that they’ll leave me.

- take every single little change as an indicator they’re over me or lost interest. Ex. My boyfriend not FaceTiming me one night means he’ll never FaceTime me again and he’s lost all interest in me despite texting me all day.

- get jealous if they mentioned anyone other than me. If my friend mentioned another friend, or if they called someone else their best friend it’s the end of the world for me. Same with my boyfriend commenting on other people’s appearance.

- would use my anxiety as a crutch in order to draw attention to me when I felt something was wrong. If I didn’t get the reaction I wanted, it would make it 10 times worse. Sometimes I even want to die when I don’t get the response I want. I used to even tell my friends that, which was SO toxic in retrospect, and I no longer do that even though I feel it deeply.

- get offended when it seems someone isn’t responding the way I want them too. I compare the beginning of relationships to the comfortable now and crave the passion and the overtrying—it makes me want to jump in and repeat the cycle even though I’m happy where I’m at.

- stop caring for these people I obsess over after a new person moves in.

I’m worried I might actually have borderline personality disorder. I actually took several online tests to indicate and compared to my neuro typical friend—she was mild indicator and I was severe. However, I know a lot of symptoms of bpd and ADHD overlap.

210,,ADHD,"Hey y'all,

I've been prescribed Vyvanse (30mg) a couple days ago and yesterday started taking it for the first time. I have previous experience with Ritalin and Strattera and so far, Vyvanse seems like the best option (ofc I can't *really* tell yet, it's only been 2 days bla bla yada yada). 

I was kind of afraid of starting to take it because I feared my appetite would be gone entirely (and this is my 1st experience ever with a stimulant) like the Strattera did (eating on Strattera was insanely hard for me which was a shame bc I love food and I'm a foodie), but to my surprise it... Actually seems to increase my appetite? I ate regular meals today, like I usually do, and despite that I was still hungry afterwards (even with snacks in between!). Is this a side effect? Will this subside eventually?

Further, I have nausea from time to time despite eating regularly and drinking a fuck ton of water (i have no issue with the latter, I normally drink 3-4l a day). I wonder whether this will subside as well?

Advice would be appreciated. I would really like to continue with this med as I, so far, have the most pleasant experiences with it (and don't feel totally ""drugged up"" or ""spaced out"" like on Ritalin/Strattera, but actually I feel like myself, just with a bit of improved focus).",t2_2b823kz4,False,,0,False,Vyvanse makes me.. hungry?,[],r/ADHD,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_m23f9t,False,light,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Questions/Advice/Support,False,1,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1615426949.0,text,0,,,text,self.ADHD,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey y&amp;#39;all,&lt;/p&gt;

214,,ADHD,"So I was tested for ADHD in middle school and was told that I just had severe anxiety that caused ADHD symptoms. I always thought this wasn't quite right and researched basically every disorder in the DSM trying to figure out what was wrong with me. Funnily enough, I never looked at ADHD because I was told I didn't have it. I finally started consistently taking anxiety medication a little over a year ago, and it helps big time to calm my anxiety, but it does nothing for those ADHD symptoms. I finally started to realize that the psychiatrist might've actually been wrong. The thing that really pushed me to get tested again was the fact that my younger sister, who's turning 20 in about a week, got diagnosed in February. I know that ADHD has a relatively large genetic component so I did a lot of research and literally my entire life made sense. Why I couldn't remember simple tasks, how I would always cut people off and finish their sentences (literally can't get through a 2 minute conversation without interjecting), how it's nearly impossible for me to read a textbook, how my ex would constantly tell me that I was terrible at listening and how my mind would go absolutely blank every time she would get mad at me, how I did well in school up until college and all of a sudden I'm quite literally failing out because I finally hit my wall (also a reason I never pursued a diagnosis because I wrongly assumed that I couldn't possibly have ADHD and do well in school), and how I would have some incredibly terrible angry outbursts at my exes that still haunt me to this day.

It's just so frustrating that I could've found this out as a child and been able to manage it and understand myself. Instead I wasted 22 years going on a wild goose chase when the answer was right in front of me the whole time. Looking back, it's almost ridiculous to think that this went under the radar for so long. 

Long story short (TL;DR), I'm new to this and could really use some help. I know the basics, but I know there is so much more to ADHD that meets the eye.

The thing that really pushed me to get tested again was the fact that my younger sister, who&amp;#39;s turning 20 in about a week, got diagnosed in February. I know that ADHD has a relatively large genetic component so I did a lot of research and literally my entire life made sense. Why I couldn&amp;#39;t remember simple tasks, how I would always cut people off and finish their sentences (literally can&amp;#39;t get through a 2 minute conversation without interjecting), how it&amp;#39;s nearly impossible for me to read a textbook, how my ex would constantly tell me that I was terrible at listening and how my mind would go absolutely blank every time she would get mad at me, how I did well in school up until college and all of a sudden I&amp;#39;m quite literally failing out because I finally hit my wall (also a reason I never pursued a diagnosis because I wrongly assumed that I couldn&amp;#39;t possibly have ADHD and do well in school), and how I would have some incredibly terrible angry outbursts at my exes that still haunt me to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s just so frustrating that I could&amp;#39;ve found this out as a child and been able to manage it and understand myself. Instead I wasted 22 years going on a wild goose chase when the answer was right in front of me the whole time. Looking back, it&amp;#39;s almost ridiculous to think that this went under the radar for so long. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short (TL;DR), I&amp;#39;m new to this and could really use some help. I know the basics, but I know there is so much more to ADHD that meets the eye. If anyone has any helpful information, advice or literally anything that you&amp;#39;ve found helpful, I could really use it right now. I feel like a new born baby just now figuring out the world. I seriously have no idea what I&amp;#39;m doing.&lt;/p&gt;

She added a stimulant recently that has had zero effect and now wants to try another medication but wants to work toward getting me into the partial program.

226,,ADHD,"I've been applying for jobs more or less since the pandemic began. I've lost count of how many applications I've submitted, but can count the number of interviews I've been offered on one hand. Late last year I was offered a very promising job only for the employer to withdraw their offer for vague reasons.

Last week I finally got another interview invitation from somewhere I applied for thinking I'd never hear back from. This place is basically everything I've been looking for and actually pays way better than any other similar role.

I just sent the administrator an email saying I wouldn't be able to make it.

I set aside the first two days of this week purely to prep for the interview, but (naturally) only found true panic-motivation this evening. I just couldn't get my thoughts or slides in order and found myself staring at things I should know with no idea how they worked. The anxiety monster was thrashing in the pit of my stomach and there was still paperwork to collect together and I hadn't packed my bag. At 1.30am I called it and decided to write that email.

I feel terrible. My dad's life motto is ""Never give up"" and he's impressed upon me how important it is that I never do either but I really don't think he understands how difficult things are for me. This feels like the first time I've had to just make the call and give up on something so important and it's just amplifying my impostor syndrome to new heights.

I dont always feel like this, sometimes I wake up and I can smash the day out and come home and smoke some of the good stuff and relax knowing ive actually done something productive and I think, do I really have ADHD? I mean, I have a job, its not the greatest in the world but I've been there 10 years now and its obviously going well or they wouldn't want me there would they?

But then some days i can barely function, its like I wake up and my brain says *NOPE* and ill spend the rest of the fucking day REALLY unmotivated and not doing a whole lot at work and just the bare minimum to scrape by. 

Its even worse at home, I can sit here for hours and just stare at the fucking blank TV screen 🙃.. or just look at things in my room or go downstairs and stare out the window.

 I want to do something but what? There's fucking LOADS of things to do, I just DON'T get it.

I'm a literal time billionaire, I still live at home, I dont have any kids and im single. I can literally do what I please (within reason) I have a shit ton of money too, its fucking annoying, I can spend it on something but due to a really bad drug habit I managed to kick after 3 years (yay!) I just hoard all my wages and dont spend it cause I used to spend it all on drugs but now I don't, I just get paid and pay my rent and buy weekly shopping. I used to live on like 90 quid for an entire month and the rest went on drugs but obviously after living on such pittance for years ive probably most likely conditioned myself to not spend money but I dunno, I get anxiety when I want to buy something? So I just don't spend it. So fuck knows what I've done to myself. Lmao. 

Anyway the titles abit misleading sorry, but today is the day when my adhd plays up, maybe its cause its lockdown? Its raining and I'm just feeling really unmotivated, I drink far too much coffee aswell. I'm always searching for that dopamine fix (which I got from taking drugs) dont do drugs kids its really not all that great and if you do, don't fucking get addicted to them! If you are taking drugs and want to quit, get professional help! 

I'm just rambling now cause I can't find anything to do, I want to do something but my brain can't decide what to do cause I have all these thoughts and none of them are sticking. Fucking adhd brain, I fucking hate you. 


Just read that back and maybe cause I am a time billionaire is the problem!? I just got far too much time on my hands. Maybe? I dont know, asking reddit isn't going to give me the answer. I'm also fucking addicted to reddit. Well, better then being addicted to Facebook that's for sure.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just rambling now cause I can&amp;#39;t find anything to do, I want to do something but my brain can&amp;#39;t decide what to do cause I have all these thoughts and none of them are sticking. Fucking adhd brain, I fucking hate you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just read that back and maybe cause I am a time billionaire is the problem!? I just got far too much time on my hands. Maybe? I dont know, asking reddit isn&amp;#39;t going to give me the answer. I&amp;#39;m also fucking addicted to reddit. Well, better then being addicted to Facebook that&amp;#39;s for sure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to go back to staring at stuff again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: lmao wtf. I just had to edit out the word &amp;quot;w**d&amp;quot; as it wouldn&amp;#39;t let me post this&lt;/p&gt;

236,,ADHD,"TL;DR at the bottom

I just started Vyvanse three days ago. I am being started on 30mg, however my psychiatrist predicted before starting that I will probably need 50mg, but we're just starting me on 30mg to test the waters since I suffer a lot from anxiety.

So basically when the vyvanse kicks in I feel great. A little bit of a headache but it goes away after some gatorade. My body becomes very relaxed and I don't feel like fidgeting that much anymore. It also helps to ease my anxiety and intrusive thoughts TREMENDOUSLY as my emotions are more stabilized and I feel like I got much more control over my thoughts. I do become less creative and less funny lol, but it's worth it. I become more hyped to do average shit and I also get more excited to talk to other people lol. I don't procrastinate when I am going to do something, I can do stuff without getting side tracked and it is much easier for me to finish what I started. 
However, I still fidget. Not as much, but I still do it. I also honestly don't feel a lot of improvement with my focus. I'm more able to do stuff without getting side tracked, but I still skimread etc and struggle to do written tasks (my reading/writing skills are good but I just still struggle to focus) this is the main thing that makes me want to up my dosage.

This lasts for about two/three hours until I start to feel tired and sluggish, and more restless/fidhety again. If I don't eat or drink enough I can feel extremely ill, like as if I have the flu, and feel extremely sleepy even if I got enough sleep the other night. I also feel numb and a bit sad/irritated and things doesn't excite me. I then feel like a zombie for the rest of the day.

Should I up my dosage? Has anyone else experience this?

TL;DR: I started Vyvanse 30mg three days ago, it hasn't improved my focus too much but my executive functioning has improved and my anxiety has gone down a lot. However I start feeling restless and sluggish again after 2/3 hours and I feel like a zombie for the rest of the day.

&lt;p&gt;I just started Vyvanse three days ago. I am being started on 30mg, however my psychiatrist predicted before starting that I will probably need 50mg, but we&amp;#39;re just starting me on 30mg to test the waters since I suffer a lot from anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically when the vyvanse kicks in I feel great. A little bit of a headache but it goes away after some gatorade. My body becomes very relaxed and I don&amp;#39;t feel like fidgeting that much anymore. It also helps to ease my anxiety and intrusive thoughts TREMENDOUSLY as my emotions are more stabilized and I feel like I got much more control over my thoughts.

I've been working really hard (just tryna finish my master's thesis... on year 3 and feeling so low) lately and that's resulted in me forgetting to take care of myself. A week ago I pulled an all-nighter as a 25 year old for the first time since high school. I had a deadline and my perfectionist tendencies won. Last night, I was up until 3am. After getting up at 6am, driving 2 hours to main campus for some help/to pick up some things (including my adderal Rx; I just moved home for my mental health and finances). Drove an extra 1m5 hours to drop something off to a friend, then drove 2.5 hours back home. I got home at 8pm. I drank a black coffee, a sugary Starbucks coffee, and a bag of Starbucks chips between 7am-8pm. I was nauseous. Hangry. Mentally exhausted. Emotional. Snappy with my partner. When filling up on gas before the final stretch of the drive, the gas station attendant had to remind me to TURN MY ENGINE OFF. It was 530pm. I was in a daze. 

I forget that my meds are not a substitute for nutrition, hydration, or energy. Im a bright gal but I push myself too hard and don't realize it until I am risking an explosion at a gas station.

You'll take longer, you'll get more distracted, you'll be more stressed and you'll struggle more to handle that. And that's okay. It's okay to accept that and go at the pace you can.

My first big presentation is Mar 24, so I have about 2 weeks to do 2 months worth of work. And I still can't seem to motivate myself to go in, I haven't done anything since last Thursday. People think I'm joking when I say stuff like that, I trust this community will understand that I literally haven't done *anything*.

I feel like I used to have a slightly better handle about at least doing enough to keep my head above water before COVID, but the last year I've literally done almost no work whatsoever at my last position or at this one. And somehow I got away with it because of the craziness of the year, but this new position I won't be able to do that.

I don't know what to do. I'm on Vyvanse and I have been off and on for over a decade. I'm afraid to talk to a doctor because if I admit that I'm struggling I feel like he will want to change things up, and I'm scared of it getting even worse than it is now. I'm 32 years old and I've basically managed to just get by my entire life because people cut me breaks all the time thinking I have potential, and I'm afraid that my ADHD has become more severe and I've reached the point in life where that no longer will work. 

I feel like I never should have taken this job. I feel like I'm letting down the people that recommended me here. I feel like I'm going to let down my family. I have no idea what I'll do if I actually get fired.

Today is my first day on it and any sort of medication in general, and I feel... weird. I am definitely seeing some improvements, I can pick up whole conversations and not have to piece together the rest, I can focus on stuff that doesn't interest me necessarily. I can pick up on a lecture I had today and I have a better track of when I've done stuff and how long ago I've done it. I don't have the urge to overeat. Most importantly I feel like I can finish something without the immense amount of pressure that I needed to feel before.

But with that being said, I also feel weird. My brain feels odd, and lightheaded. The feeling comes and goes. Is this normal for my first time? My doctor says I would maybe feel stimulated and it would cause insomnia if I took it too late but I'm honestly feeling just, normal. I was never hyperactive but I feel more in control of my bodily movements now. Sorry for the jumble of thoughts but the whole situation is kind of odd to me.

248,,ADHD,"[TL;DR: I've been very open with my coworkers and supervisors about my adhd, but I have issues so inconsistently that people have begun suspecting that I'm faking problems to get out of things I don't want to do. I've talked to management about it and thought we'd reached an understanding, but things are getting tense again. I wonder if my recent improvement in handling my issues might be working against me.]

I'm 37, diagnosed at 30.  I take Adderall daily. After I lost my office job two years ago, I started working in fast food (well, beverages, really.)

I've been learning a lot about adhd since my diagnosis, and sensory overload didn't even enter the conversation with a therapist until about a year before I lost my job.

When I started the fast food job, I knew there was going to be an adjustment period for me to get used to working in a fast-paced, noisy environment with frequent demands to multi-task.  I also knew that I would be in very close proximity to other people and that physical contact would be unavoidable. (We bump into each other a lot!)

I've been very open with my issues, and everyone was generally very supportive, at least at first.

It's taken me a long time to get to the point where I can function more or less normally, but I still have major issues with being told to ""speed up"" (Which leads to me panicking and making mistakes), and with completely shutting down when I get overwhelmed. I also had an anger outburst last year that was completely out of character for me and led to my getting a write-up.

So here's the problem:

Some days, I'm completely fine.  I've gone full months without any problems.  And then out of nowhere, suddenly I'm having meltdowns or multiple days where I'm having major problems at work.  It's extremely inconsistent, and some of my coworkers commented to supervisors that it looked like I was just ""having issues"" to get out of things I didn't want to do.

That led to complaints from coworkers to management that it was unfair that I could just start stuttering or acting anxious, and then get to go sit in the back or wash dishes.

I was only made aware of this when a supervisor made an offhand comment about how I'm ""being babied"" and how I needed to knock it off.

There were conversations between me and management and I thought we'd reached an understanding, but things are starting to get tense again.

I recognize this is definitely the wrong environment for me, but I do get decent benefits from my job and I'm still hoping that I'll eventually be able to go back to school to get the certifications I need to pursue what I'm passionate about.

Management at my store recognizes that I do good work, but when I've directly asked if they think I'm faking my ADHD (during conversations regarding the above problems), they don't outright say yes, but they do give me that ""knowing look"".

I've been steadily improving with coping and taking measures to prevent shutdowns and meltdowns, but I think that might be working against me?  Like ""oh, you can do it NOW, so I guess you just needed to try hard and work at it"" or something like that?

It's gotten to the point where I'm even questioning whether I've actually got adhd or if I've just convinced myself that I do.

I&amp;#39;ve talked to management about it and thought we&amp;#39;d reached an understanding, but things are getting tense again. I wonder if my recent improvement in handling my issues might be working against me.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 37, diagnosed at 30.  I take Adderall daily. After I lost my office job two years ago, I started working in fast food (well, beverages, really.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been learning a lot about adhd since my diagnosis, and sensory overload didn&amp;#39;t even enter the conversation with a therapist until about a year before I lost my job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started the fast food job, I knew there was going to be an adjustment period for me to get used to working in a fast-paced, noisy environment with frequent demands to multi-task.  I also knew that I would be in very close proximity to other people and that physical contact would be unavoidable. (We bump into each other a lot!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been very open with my issues, and everyone was generally very supportive, at least at first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s taken me a long time to get to the point where I can function more or less normally, but I still have major issues with being told to &amp;quot;speed up&amp;quot; (Which leads to me panicking and making mistakes), and with completely shutting down when I get overwhelmed. I also had an anger outburst last year that was completely out of character for me and led to my getting a write-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;#39;s the problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some days, I&amp;#39;m completely fine.  I&amp;#39;ve gone full months without any problems.  And then out of nowhere, suddenly I&amp;#39;m having meltdowns or multiple days where I&amp;#39;m having major problems at work.  It&amp;#39;s extremely inconsistent, and some of my coworkers commented to supervisors that it looked like I was just &amp;quot;having issues&amp;quot; to get out of things I didn&amp;#39;t want to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That led to complaints from coworkers to management that it was unfair that I could just start stuttering or acting anxious, and then get to go sit in the back or wash dishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was only made aware of this when a supervisor made an offhand comment about how I&amp;#39;m &amp;quot;being babied&amp;quot; and how I needed to knock it off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were conversations between me and management and I thought we&amp;#39;d reached an understanding, but things are starting to get tense again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recognize this is definitely the wrong environment for me, but I do get decent benefits from my job and I&amp;#39;m still hoping that I&amp;#39;ll eventually be able to go back to school to get the certifications I need to pursue what I&amp;#39;m passionate about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Management at my store recognizes that I do good work, but when I&amp;#39;ve directly asked if they think I&amp;#39;m faking my ADHD (during conversations regarding the above problems), they don&amp;#39;t outright say yes, but they do give me that &amp;quot;knowing look&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been steadily improving with coping and taking measures to prevent shutdowns and meltdowns, but I think that might be working against me?  Like &amp;quot;oh, you can do it NOW, so I guess you just needed to try hard and work at it&amp;quot; or something like that?&lt;/p&gt;

I know that ADHD is linked heavily with feelings of shame but the articles I’ve found really only mention shame from perceived failures due to ADHD symptoms.

However, I’m 22 but I’ve had some very stressful things happen including sexual assault, abusive relationship at 16 with an older man, etc. things I know are not my fault and would kill another woman for feeling shame over. Yet I feel so much shame over those events that I cannot for the life of me speak about them with anyone. I’ve only spoken about them to a therapist once and only because I dissociated severely and daily and told her while dissociated and barely knew what was going on. But since those episodes stopped, I feel a debilitating embarrassment at the thought of anyone finding out or trying to speak with me about them. 

I’m usually a super happy person (the H ADHD is strong haha) but since I’ve never properly processed, I do get flashbacks, occasionally dissociation and cannot be in the presence of a man more than once without some serious Xanax. I know that processing through will help SO MUCH but i literally physically cannot because of embarrassment.

&lt;p&gt;at 1am the urgency finally kicked in &amp;amp; i wrote my entire presentation script. but now my eyes are heavy. i made a few slides but i know damn well im not finishing this tonight. it’s 4am again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so basically im exhausted and i keep sabotaging myself. i was THIS close to meeting a deadline &amp;amp; i ruined it at the last minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tomorrow (or today ig)  isnt the only day to present, thursday we’re presenting too, and my teacher told me i could totally take a thursday slot. but it still feels like failure. presentations stress me out &amp;amp; i just wanted to take my second slot on the first day &amp;amp; get it over with. i just wanted to set ONE goal and meet it. and now im double sleep deprived &amp;amp; im probably gonna crash off my meds tomorrow, which is also conveniently my last one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;anyways im just sleep deprived &amp;amp; tired of my brain not agreeing with me. i made a pact with myself to do my slides as soon as i get home &amp;amp; then go to bed at like 10pm like a normal person, but we’ll see how well that goes&lt;/p&gt;

I hate my college education right now. So much. Today I couldn't even muster the energy to glance at my work and I knew I'd fail assignments for classes that I'm already shakey in. I just don't freaking care. I'm not attached to the classes or the people in the class, or anything really.

I'm a biology major and I'm usually good with science, but I can't force myself into doing it anymore. I'm not sure if it's because it's online or what, but I'm suffering. The only class I like is a gen ed, Ethics. Like I love this class, but I'm not sure I love it for on the contents or because it's just easy. I'm the kind of person that is either natural talented at something, or just plain ole shit at it (and I will never ever put in the effort to better myself in it if it doesn't come naturally). That alone might be an ADHD thing, I'm not sure. But it should be said that I hate even the classes that pertain to my major. 

I'm flirting with the idea of switching majors, but I'm hesitant. I'm a sophomore and I switched my majors last year's from veterinary science to general biology so I don't want to just keep switch shit up. I will mention I noticed this pattern that half way through a school year I will get bored of everything and the second semester I will start to suffering in grades and care. 

At the same time, I'm suffering from apathy. I want to be a english major, which is completely fucking different. I know nothing with switch over and I'm terrified I'll begin to hate english too. It's hard to convince my parents who are paying for all this too. The thing is that I love english and I'm good at it, but I'm scared it will be a ""grass is greener"" situation that I'll wind up regretting. I know any major will have it's challenges, but I actually think I might have a shot with this one. That's also what I thought when I changed my major before.

And fuck this fucking covid online thing. I'm so good at learning when it's in person and I can't fucking telling I'm struggling with the content I'm learning or the online aspect or both. I'm in like a whirlpool and possible things that could push me in either way and I can't fucking tell what's what anymore and this decision will affect my entire fucking life.

262,,ADHD,"I have struggled with timely sleep my entire life. ""Revenge Bedtime Procrastination"" generally, but sometimes my rhythm is just off. I am middle aged now and if I miss more than two nights of timely sleep, it will literally take WEEKS to recover.

Sleep hygiene advice is good and helpful, and has worked in conjunction with this strategy I've been trying to do the past few months, and has been pretty successful at helpinge get back on track.

I have 7 blue square cards that have restickable tape (painters blue tape) on the back, and ""sleep"" written on the front. They all look the same.

I have decided, for me, that I want 7-8 hrs per night. I've learned I feel best after this amount. I need to wake up by 7:30 so I need to be in bed between 11 and 12.

Success is when I make decisions that are in support of this habit, eg.. Choosing to do my night routine at 11 or so. 
Not success is  starting another episode, or another project, or doing anything else that isn't leading towards sleeping in my bed, 

I fall asleep well enough (sometimes with sleep aids) that starting my routine is sufficient to lead to better habits; your definition of success may he different.

When I have 2 successes consecutively, I stick a blue card up on the wall byy bathroom. If I have a single not success, I do not add a card. If I have two consecutive not successes, I remove all the cards that I had accumulated.

I've found that 7 or 8 cards (the number on the boundary if the brain just shorthanding ""many"")  is sufficient for me, tho there's no reason it couldn't continue indefinitely.



Originally, I started with adding one every night and then wiping all of them, but I found that to be a bit unkind to myself, and I felt like I failed a lot more if I messed up a day. It sucks when an opportunity comes up that requires bending the rule a little and you lose all your progress, y'know?

My longest streak with this was November to mid December (2020) -- about 6 weeks. The difference in my brain function was notable. I had two days of vacation time, spaced a few days apart, around xmas, where I stayed up too late and lost ally progress. I am currently at 3 cards, going on 4 tomorrow.

266,,ADHD,"Hello again! Your advice helped so much last time, it meant a lot. We got a lot of the blue tack off the walls now! My partner has a calendar they use! Yay!

There is a small thing I need advice on. It bugs the hell out of me and I can't tell if it's a me problem or something that needs worked on.

My partner always seems to remember things when I do them. Like, always. Examples: if I go to study, they remember they have to study. If I sweep the floors, they remember they wanted to sweep the bathroom floor. If I lay down because my back hurts, they need to lay down too.

It's really started to irritate me because it's made me feel like all jobs are my responsibility to notice first. Also it means they get in the way nearly every time they begin the same task I'm doing.

I will start getting dressed and then they will. If I go to the grocery store, they have to come with me, because they have a list too.  If I water the living room plants, they water the bedroom ones.

You would THINK I'd appreciate the help, and I do, but it means I also can't hyper focus on any of my chores. I have to constantly be aware of their presence, I will be halfway through a chore, say watering plants, go to the bedroom with my watering can and oh... They are doing it as I'm in the doorway. I suddenly have to switch tasks. And then when I do, they do that one too.

Is this as annoying to others as I am finding it? I understand someone with ADHD needs reminders, but I don't exist to be a living reminder either, you know? Plus sometimes I would like to focus on a task from start to finish without being abruptly interrupted.

I've tried to talk to them about this before and they said they understood why it would make me feel like the pressure on me was to start every task we do, but it never stopped because adhd and forgetting, you know? They simply do not remember they had tasks planned unless I start them.

There is a huge caveat here that I am disabled and my partner is great at daily chores, cooking, laundry, the really obvious stuff. It's the non-obvious chores like sweeping, wiping windows, counters, cleaning out the fridge, studying etc that they can't keep track of.

So do I just need to calm my farm or should I try to word this discussion a better way to my partner?

Tl;Dr at the end.

I was diagnosed earlier this year and I'm undecided on whether I made the right choice. I decided not to go on, or even try meds. 

My reasons being I wanted to give it a true genuine go myself before resorting to medication, I'm prone to health anxiety, and I have underlying autoimmune issues and I don't want to put a strain on my body.

But ever since then............I've been in a funk. 

I'm writing this because it will feel better to get it out. No one understands what I'm struggling with (except my mum). My friends try to empathise and give advice, but their help doesn't always work for me. My venting makes me sound lazy and undisciplined, which I hate, because at my core im not like that. So I don't usually say exactly what im going through. It's a struggle just to get a grip on functioning. I've just started to eat properly like a normal human again, with actual nutrition. My friends ask me ""how was your day?"" and I have nothing much to say, because I can't get to bed at a decent hour, so I can't wake up at a decent hour, and if I don't have premade food, I don't eat, and if I don't eat I can't do anything until I've eaten. If I don't eat properly, my mental and physical health is a mess. I'm constantly being distracted both intentionally and unintentionally.

I tried to get onto an adhd coach that was recommended by my doctor....so many times. But they never got back to me. I emailed. I called multiple times. I left a message. I left my email on their website to be contacted. Nothing. Nada. So I feel let down. And like what's the point. Also adhd coaches are so expensive! I am terrible with money, I keep losing it. 

Tl;dr. 

1. Got diagnosed.
2. Decided not to medicate. 
3. No one understands my struggles.
4. I'm really struggling to function. It's an uphill battle, and I have an invisible handicap.
5. Can't get through to recommended adhd coach
6. I'm not good with money. Adhd coaches are expensive.
7. This is hard! I feel really bad about myself. I'm going to keep trying harder though. I will succeed.

I was diagnosed as an adult and I'm currently on 36mg Concerta, and I've been taking it every day because I have work to do every day. I'm desperately trying to keep up and can't really afford to be less productive. 

The issue is that my sleep has been kinda messed up. I will sleep like 4 hours a day, and I'm woken up really easily by noise (I'm not normally), so really it's more like 2 blocks of 2 hours sleep a day. If I try to sleep more I just lie there for hours in the dark. I'm always a bit exhausted which also won't help productivity. So I decided not to take my meds over the weekend and I slept like a log. \~14 hours both days. I was so hungry and sleepy all the time. This was a lot of time to lose to not working.

&lt;p&gt;She got me all excited because on our first session she was telling me that she thought i was mildly autistic (asperger&amp;#39;s level) as well as having ADHD. Ive thought this too because I have been diagnosed several times with NVLD which alot of people think is very related.. this would open up so much for me as far as  employment help which i desperately need&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supposedly she specializes in ADHD but i think that&amp;#39;s just a bunch of crap. Is this just what therapy is or is it just harder for us with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;

288,,ADHD,"Where I live (Italy), I can definitely say mental health is not a trivial matter and that many people are aware about mental disorders. But ADHD is always unheard of. 

There are psychologists and classes about mental health at school, but neurodevelopmental disorders, especially ADHD, are often overlooked... People kind of know about autism, dyslexia, etc. But have never heard of ADHD, met anyone with ADHD in their life or learned about it anywhere.

When I first suspected I had ADHD, I told my experiences to my friends and to one of my teachers, but all of them didn't recognize the disorder, my friends thought I just had depression (true, but that's not the point). Note that these people are pretty progressive and open-minded, a couple of my friends are also very keen on mental health and educating themselves about such topics, so I was very surprised when they told me they didn't even know such a disorder existed.

I feel like in the US ADHD is more recognised, and even if there are stereotypes and prejudice at least there is a bit of awareness. Here when no one even knows what I'm talking about really discourages me to even explain  it to others, like my family.

Depression or anxiety disorder for example, are well known, therefore people are more understanding and lots of psychologists are specialised for it, while an ADHD specialist is pretty rare to find. The fact that I live in a relatively small city doesn't help, but we do have resources for other mental health issues, like mental health centers or counseling centers. 
So I wonder how do we not have much awareness or knowledge about ADHD? 

I know like one famous YouTuber who has it and that's it, never met people who have ADHD or heard people talk about it, even my school counselor and psychologist basically don't know what is it.

We also have limitations on pharmaceutical use, I think only some Methylphenidate based medications and Atomoxetine are commercially viable in Italy, Adderall and Concerta for example are not prescribable, so if a those type of medications don't work for me I can do nothing about it.

I also wish I could formulate more coherent and eloquent conversations to help raise awareness and educate people, but when I do try to explain ADHD I turn into a fumbling mess, diminishing how serious of a disorder it actually is... people are already unfamiliar with it, what I want the least is for them to misunderstand ADHD as a person just being lazy and unmotivated.



TL;DR There is very little awareness of ADHD in Italy, although mental health is supposedly an important issue here.

289,,ADHD,"Story about my experience with my first and only psychiatrist. Last December I thought it was time to do whatever it took to become mentally stable.

From what I understand the general (super simplified) idea is that people with ADHD can’t filter out external distractions, and can’t control their impulses to engage with these distractions, so they often get sidetracked and then can’t remember what they were doing before they got sidetracked because of the poor working memory. Also there is a problem with time-blindness and inability to learn from the past and see into the future, including delayed future consequences, so people with ADHD act ”in the moment” and struggle to motivate themselves to sustain future goals (especially if it requires some boring and repetitive action).

296,,ADHD,"  So I recently left a job at Starbucks, as I found many aspects of the work to be overwhelming, such as the fast-paced environment, the need to multitask, rude customers, etc. For context, in addition to having ADHD, I also have issues with slow processing, particularly auditory processing, and have been diagnosed with ASD (although I lack many of the common symptoms).  I am also more of an introvert, which can make customer service jobs such as Starbucks even more stressful.

So this is my first time back in school after a 1 year-ish hiatus. 

As someone with ADHD I have a lot of trouble with organization and whatnot but I’m working on it. My mind feels SO much more capable now but I still have tons of issues with organization and planning. 

Everything being online is kinda new to me but I thought I was fine.

The thing is, for the longest time now I’ve had massive anxiety when it comes to texts/emails/inboxes/etc. It is very easy for me to be overwhelmed or to be scared to check my inbox of texts or whatever.

On the first week of school I had a day where I had a bad GERD/IBS flare up and I was miserable the whole day and then I missed an assignment deadline (only 5% reduction which is fine). I sent my prof a dramatic email apologizing about being late and explaining myself. 

The problem is that because of that embarrassment I started being scared of checking my inbox for school.

So NOW, there’s 2 assignments that I ducking missed because I didn’t ducking check my inbox. They were already due fucking 2 days ago. Like I literally was not aware of the assignments until an hour ago. I need to complete 1 assignment to unlock and complete the other assignment. The first assignment is very small but I need to get 100% on it to unlock the following assignment. The problem is, because it’s fucking late because I’m an idiot, I can’t unlock it. So I have to email her. 

I feel like such a fucking moron. I want to scream. The thing is in my first dramatic email I already told her “sorry sorry it won’t happen again” and then “I don’t want to be a problem student” but here I fucking am 


What the hell am I supposed to tell her

“I’m sorry professor on top of the PLETHORA of other issues I have, I also have massive anxiety when it comes to fucking checking my inboxes because of past trauma involving a romantic partner and probably something else I don’t remember. Can you please unlock the assignment?” 

I would just take the L but she came across as the type of professor that wants to understand her students. 


Like on one hand, I don’t want to just make excuses. But on the other hand I want to explain myself and I’m so ducking embarrassed but I was already embarrassed about my OTHER late assignments.

298,,ADHD,"Hi all,

About 12 months ago I resigned from employment and this anniversary has led to me doing some introspection.  I’ve come to realise that I’ve quit every full-time permanent position I’ve held on something of a whim.  In actual fact, with both of my two most recent resignations I went to work that morning not knowing I would quit my job later that day.  This means that across the six roles I’ve held in my life, the longest period of continuous employment has been 16/17 months and the average length has been roughly 10-12 months. 

There’s a pattern of behaviour here in so far as I become very frustrated/resentful with the structures/constraints that formal employment places on me as an individual.  This steadily builds up over time as the novelty of the new role and the new people starts to dwindle.  I also become frustrated/resentful with a lack of promotion and pay increase which (rightly or wrongly) I feel increasingly entitled to.

I’ve been lucky as on the two most recent occasions I’ve failed upwards so I have no serious regrets as such but I’m also aware my behaviour has meant I’ve taken on significant financial, professional and emotional/social risks without any prior consideration.

I’m looking to see if this is consistent with other people’s experience of the condition as well as to understand if there are any coping techniques to try and control such behaviours in the future.

301,,ADHD,"Alright you little bastards put down your gamestations and your tiktoks and listen up.   
If youre like me and have a 9-5 it can be really fkn hard to get moving in the morning, so here's a top tip.

TL;DR: Knock over a few little jobs first thing.  It will make life easier i swear.

I used to work in general engineering. Every day there was a handful of jobs on our plate and we'd chip away at it, staying more or less on top of it. Days would consist of phonecalls, clerical and shop work. I did my best to keep my one week/2 pages diary open on my desk all the time. Any little job, or change, or phonecall went in it. I did my very best to keep it stuck to my desk and updated with a few notes a day. I know many people here have trouble with diaries, and i used to just lose them or give up on them. The reason i think this worked for me was i made a rule that it never left my desk. 

So I would come in in the morning and have a look at the BIG JOB and want nothing to do with it. Instead of freezing up and wasting time, i'd try to have a look at all the little 5 minute jobs I was going to get around to. Call the guy, drop off the thing, etc.

I've found that if you have a crack at a couple of little jobs in the morning, you start to get your ball rolling. Finish off a couple of easy things and your brain gets a lil bump of dopamine. You can tick something off in that diary. Now you have a little momentum and all of a sudden that BIG JOB doesnt look quite as big.

I got good grades in high school, but always knew that I had trouble with concentrating and actually understanding/retaining information. I suffered a lot in university, but I’m in my last year and trying to study for the MCAT so that I can pursue my dreams of becoming a doctor. 

I have tried out medications since being diagnosed, here are my experiences: 

Vyvanse: 30 mg -&gt; 60 mg (3 months)
My concentration was slightly better but I was not any better at retrieving information. I felt like I had constant brain fog and found myself to be forgetting things (more often than not on it). I felt like a zombie and no emotions. 

Strattera: 40 mg -&gt; 60 mg -&gt; 80 mg (3 months) 
I hated it so much. I couldn’t sleep at all, I averaged maybe 7 hours a week, had constant migraines and headaches (I’ve never EVER had them before in my life) to the point where I would cry from the pain and I felt so depressed and anxious on it. Didn’t help my concentration at all.

Wellbutrin XL: 150 mg (1 month) 
Definitely improved my mood! I’m motivated to do my routine in the morning, I’m less irritated and I can calm myself down when I get upset. But it’s not helping my concentration at all. 

My doctor recently prescribed Ritalin IR 10mg twice daily, but I’ve had no effects from it.

I’m so frustrated of switching medications and getting my hopes up thinking that I’ll finally be able to do the things I want to do. I look at this group for support and although I’m happy, I can’t help but feel jealous of others who have found the right medications for them. I want to be able to experience a clear head, being able to do what I love and actually sticking with it, and being able to retain information. I feel like I am SO close to being able to do it, like I have the potential to do amazing but I just can’t focus or bring out the information when I need it. My doctor doesn’t seem to understand this. He keeps telling me that I should try mindfulness even though I have in the past. My mind constantly wanders, I want to move around all the time and I have too many thoughts going on at once.

311,,ADHD,"Hello! I just got diagnosed with ADHD in January, started on 18 mg of concerta originally, it was helping my anxiety and my mood issues, as well as my hyperactivity but it wasnt helping me focus so we decided to up me to 27 mg. The 27 was a bad move as it caused a really bad pounding heart feeling, make me so hyperware and just extremely uncomfortable for the first bit. I was more awake through out the day, and eventually I kind of settled into it after like 2 weeks, but I was still having off days where it hit me particularly hard. It almost made me worried that I was getting a high off it. It was again helping hyperactivity, mood,  and anxiety but I dont think focus. We decided to switch me to focalin xr and my psychiatrist converted the 27 of concerta over to 15 mg of focalin, and she was kind of worried that i would get the same like wide awake heart pounding and shes said from the beginning that maybe I just cant handle stimulants. The focalin didnt give me any side effects, no pounding heart no hyper awareness, nothing. I was extremely surprised but for the first hour or so after it kicked in I was sitting on my phone and I realized like I wasnt hearing anything around me. My house is extremely noisy and I wasnt picking up on any of it unless I took the second to think about it. I had gotten 3 hours of sleep the night before so im kind of chalking it up to lack of sleep or maybe a placebo effect, but I dont even know how to explain it, I had this feeling of I was so zoned in on my phone but at the same time my brain was working so slow that I wasnt like whole heartedly processing what I was doing on my phone. When I got up and walked around I felt like I was just so much slower. My brain almost felt empty for once, but at the same time I kind of felt claustrophobic because everything was so slowed down. It was like everything had been stripped away. I dont know if it was a good or bad feeling, if it means it was working or not?

312,,ADHD,"I was diagnosed with ADHD in third grade. I tired several medical options. Concerta worked best for me, no crying for no reason and stuff.

I can't really remember my first experiences with medication. But my parents told me that in 3rd grade I spent about 3 hours doing my homework. Much more has not got stuck.

I now take Concerta every day. 4 or 5 years ago the pressure was less and at the weekend I either forgot to take it and at some point consciously skipped it. Food tastes soo much better without it!!!

I love food :D

My experience with Concerta has changed me a lot personally. I don't know if others can confirm this, but the difference between with and without medication is very big.

I would describe myself as socially competent, friendly, extrovert and very interested in other people. I like interacting with other people and like myself. But without medication, I find it difficult to concentrate and adhere to the limits of others (family). I forget a lot and tend to be messy. 

With medication (especially at school), I tend to be quiet and reserved and I am less enthusiastic about the interests of others. I am more of an observer and passive participant in the conversation. But I can concentrate much better and I'm about to graduate from high school (Abitur). I am familiar with Anxiety attacks which are mainly reinforced by the medication. I've learned to deal with something like that and meanwhile I have no more problems with something like that.

313,,ADHD,"So, like a lot of people, I'd like to get diagnosed/treated for adhd. Only issue? I'm scared of the cost.

So, I was wondering how you all maybe cut costs in order to get diagnosed and treated. For background, I live in the US (New England). I have okay insurance through my job.

I was wondering if I got my doctor to write me a referral, is it common to have the consultation covered? I don't think itd take much to get the diagnosis. I have the symptoms and I can easily describe them. My biggest red flags have always been my issues with sleep (for example, I have a fear of snakes. If I think of a snake while trying to sleep, my mind will fixate on it and it will keep me up for, no joke, hours. In a dark room. Just awake. Conversely, if I'm thinking about a topic I'm interested in, I will also spend hours just in my head without realizing it before I fall asleep) and my issues with time management - as in I just don't always realize time is passing? Like I randomly get so lost in my many thoughts that I disassociate from reality until I am late to everything.

I started realizing something was wrong when I asked this guy ""what are you thinking about?"" And he said ""nothing"". And I pressed on like ""you have to be thinking about something"" and he insisted that he really wasn't actively thinking about anything. I was baffled. I had always thought having constant engaging thoughts all the time about anything at all was normal!

I kinda realized it was adhd when I did a sleep study at my university and they said I had high brain activity. Searched it up and every internet link was about adhd. 

Even now, I'm supposed to be sleeping but I absolutely had to write up this post which I'm putting way too much information in I think but what the hell.

315,,ADHD,"TL;DR I think my psych views me as """"med seeking"""" and I feel like I have to walk on eggshells to get my needs met, especially after a recent miscommunication. I am not at an effective dose and I'm afraid to ask for a higher one.

From the beginning, I felt very scrutinized and judged by this doc. I have been diagnosed before, but by a provider in another state. Despite this, she insisted I get diagnosed within the practice and sent me off to someone I had never met who berated me for two hours about my childhood and trauma and made me fill out 3 different print outs of the tests you'd find online when you search ""ADHD diagnosis quiz."" He came back and said ""your scores are pretty high"" with a lot of suspicion and, ""well you are bipolar and people with bipolar generally have worse focus than people without"" (as if they're not extremely comorbid), but did inevitably diagnose me.

We have been ""titrating"" my dose for months and I'm only on 15 mg Adderall XR. My last psych stabalized my meds at 18.8 mg Adzendys (equivalent to 30 mg Adderall XR). During our last appointment, I thought she suggested at that time I take the last of my 10 mg with my 25 mg until I was due for a refill and she could change my script; this was also written on the after appointment summary I received. My last psych would go up in 10 mg doses like this and combine meds until my insurance would cover a refill, so none of this registered as out of the ordinary, and I was relieved I felt like I was taken seriously. After a week, I messaged saying that this was more helpful, but I'm still not quite able to perform the bare minimum at work or keep up with basic chores. She messaged back that I should not have been taking 25mg, and need to go back to 15 mg. I told her multiple times before, over message and during our last appointment, that 15 mg has barely any effect, good or bad. It's been 5 days since that message where I have been on this dose and after taking a dose that was a little more effective, I am incredbly aware of how difficult everything is.

I feel very insecure continually begging to up my dose, but this is having major effects on my life and like I have ADHD so I'm really impatient even beyond that. My numbers at work since I started working from home (so moving from a place with more accountability and social structure and an all around less distracting environment to one with no accountability where I literally have to do all my work on the same smart phone I scroll witter with) are abysmal and I have received multiple warnings and am afraid of losing my job. I am becoming a little depressed being unable to take on personal projects or follow through on plans with friends out of sheer lack of focus and distractibility. My partner has been busy lately and the house is in chaos because I am unable to keep up with the chores. I literally procrastinate and forget about doing basic tasks such as drinking water to the point that I've been having awful and painful flair ups bc I've got a chronic illness that requires I actually do just the bare minimum to stay healthy. My doctor does not seem to hear me when I express this and I'm all around am very disheartened. 

I am really scared to reach out for fear of even further judgement that may like I don't know get me put on some list or something, but I cannot keep living basically undiagnosed, it's miserable.

And even after surprising myself with two months of consistent practice, I didn&amp;#39;t notice any difference in my playing, any improvement in the drills, and I couldn&amp;#39;t bring any intention into my playing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My ADHD diagnosis is relatively recent, so I&amp;#39;m wondering if anyone can relate to that? Or has any helpful advice? It&amp;#39;s discouraging to feel like there&amp;#39;s such a low ceiling to any of these efforts I undertake.&lt;/p&gt;

330,,ADHD,"Last month, I went to the dentist because I saw a small dot on one of my teeth that I thought could be a cavity on the left side of my mouth.

But when I went for the checkup, my shitty memory and nonexistent spatial reasoning skills had me say that the spot was on the RIGHT side of my mouth. So that's where they looked.

They also did a full exam and told me I had no cavities, and that I had a small spot where I had an old filling and that might be what I was seeing. (I was so happy because that never happens to me!)

The other day (about a month later), I was brushing my teeth and saw... a spot. But because of this incredibly bad memory, I could not remember if this was a new spot or the same spot. I also couldn't remember if the dentist had addressed it or looked at it. 

That's where my anxiety kicked in. I could NOT remember what went down, but my anxiety was telling me that this was a brand new cavity and I HAD to get it looked at immediately or it was going to develop into a root canal. I just can't relax thinking I'm going to have a medical issue if I don't do something.

... So I went back to the dentist about a month later. They looked at the spot and said the exact same thing: it's just a spot from an old filling. 

This shit is really, really humiliating. I feel like I'm this special brand of stupid because my memory fails and then my anxiety gaslights the shit out of me.

To top it off, I live with someone who is immunocompromised, so going to the dentist is kind of an ordeal - every time I come back I isolate for 5 days and then get a covid test. So it's a huge pain in the ass (and more anxiety) for no reason. Thank god my insurance will cover the second trip too or I'd also be paying a hefty ADHD tax.

My biggest symptoms of ADHD are lots of decision paralysis, difficulty motivating myself to start tasks because of a feeling of overwhelmedness, my environments ending up overly cluttered / disorganized, constantly running late to things, etc. – along with some of the ""upsides,"" like the ability to hyperfocus on a thing once I get the inertia going to do so

My doctor told me that they generally do not prescribe stimulants out-of-the-gate, starting with non-stimulants instead.  ""If we find these aren't working well for you, and we want to seriously consider the stimulants, then we have to do a little bit more work – have some testing done""

I've absolutely heard of wellbutrin being prescribed for ADHD; an ex-partner of mine was prescribed it, and did amazingly with it

I'm concerned, however, because a lot of the posts I read here – as well as information elsewhere on the internet – seems to suggest that non-stimulants (esp. off-label wellbutrin) are considered a second-line treatment, if stimulants have issues.... which seem to the be the opposite of what my doctor is going with

I'm not sure of the logic here.  My guess is it's one of the following:

* Is it that stimulants are more of a controlled substance, so it's an easier thing to go with something like wellbutrin first?
* Is it because stimulants can have negative physical effects, such as cardiovascular health issues, so it's better to start with a non-stimulant from this school of thought?
* Is it because my main symptoms that I struggle with have a lot of overlap with depressive and anxiety disorders, and therefore wellbutrin would do better in addressing that intersection than a stimulant - as a drug that works for both depression &amp; ADHD?

Today I had a really big cry because it all hit me how I feel a layer of permanent dissociation from the world due to how out of hand my inattentiveness and internal monologue has gotten to, and I said to myself “okay enough is enough, starting today I’m going to meditate everyday, as often as I can to make myself feel more grounded and centred and actually present in reality” so I did that, with a bit of struggle, I managed to feel the most mentally grounded that I have for years and years now and I gotta tell you, it was the best I have felt mentally for years and years. 

The layer of dissociation caused by my severe inattentiveness and maladaptive daydreaming caused me to not be able to enjoy movies like I used to, caused me to not react appropriately in social situations, caused a lot of emotional dysregulation, and many other things on top of that, it was actually severely crippling to my mental health. 

Today I put my first foot forward at trying to ground myself and wax my brain into a more grounded and much much healthier mindset. 

Thought I would just put this here because I am so incredibly happy right now and have been giving myself some self love today, brought me happiness beyond belief.

348,,ADHD,"Story/Rant time! 

I recently purchased a Garmin VenuSq (smart watch) to help keep track of my activity and general health. Now, something I had been hoping to get along with the watch was a smart water bottle (keeps track of water intake &amp; will send reminders if you’re not drinking enough) which seems like an amazing tool for someone who routinely forgets to drink water because of ADHD! 

I went online and to my dismay, any smart water bottles I could find were only compatible with Fitbit or Apple watches so I turned to the Garmin reddit community in hopes that they might be able to direct me to one that I might have missed in my searches.

Boy was I wrong

Here are some of the replies I got to my post... (0 likes on post)

&gt;&gt; I agree. Smart water bottles is where I draw the line. If you can’t keep track of how much water you drank, or you can’t tell you are thirsty, there is a problem (5 likes)

&gt; Garmin has a hydration widget! It means manual input but it’s fairly easy to use and can save you a ton of money because instead of a smart bottle you can buy a YETI bottle and you are set! (only decent reply, 0 likes)
&gt;&gt; (me) I have ADHD so manual input can be difficult for me to remember. I was hoping for something that could be a reminder for me to drink as well as keep track of my intake (0 likes)
&gt;&gt;&gt; I would say take a water bottle, put some tape on it and put lines on and set goals with how much you should drink before or at that time. Then keep the water bottle in view. Simple, and takes all of $1 for tape and a permanent marker (3 likes)

“If you can’t keep track of how much water you drank or can’t tell you are thirsty, there is a problem” THANK YOU KAREN! I’M AWARE THERE’S A PROBLEM AND IT’S CALLED ADHD AND IT’S SOMETHING I’VE STRUGGLED WITH ALL MY LIFE!! But THANK YOU for making me feel like an IDIOT for wanting to invest in something that is going to help me be a healthier human being! THANK YOU for reminding me of the struggles I have DAILY that regular people don’t struggle with at all! THANK YOU for making me feel like my my disability is something to be mocked!

And then there’s mr. smart guy telling me to use tape and a sharpie. If I can’t remember to tap my watch a few times and input my water intake, HOW IN THE HELL am i gonna remember to put tape on a water bottle, bring that water bottle with me and put it in plain sight, actually drink and refill said water bottle, and do it ALL AGAIN the next day?!?! And that’s not even touching on the fact that all of it takes motivation and personal accountability that I DON’T HAVE!!! 

Is it absolutely ridiculous that I need a watch &amp; water bottle to remind me to drink? Yes, it sure as hell is and I would VERY MUCH like it if I could remember to drink and keep track of my intake by myself. But the simple truth is that I CAN’T! I want to so bad! And I hate that nobody gets it and all they see is some stupid person who needs a water bottle to tell them when to drink....

351,,ADHD,"This is long, but I am struggling with possibly being misdiagnosed so I would really value some input.

I've been struggling with focus, procrastination, paying attention, meeting deadlines, etc. for years now. I'm 28 years old and in my PhD program. I first really noticed that it was affecting my abilities when I was 18. But my parents note hyperactivity, procrastination and some academic struggles in my childhood. I've always just coped with it. Since starting my PhD program 2.5 years ago, I haven't been able to handle it well at all. I've been thinking about getting evaluated since my first semester. In this last year, my progress has completely halted. It's gotten so bad that I have developed depression symptoms, and I might quit.

I finally got evaluated. It was determined I don't qualify for an ADHD diagnosis because they couldn't determine a high enough number of symptoms in my childhood. Also, my grades in college were average for the most part. For each of my symptoms, they isolated each one and explained it with an alternative cause. I was diagnosed with Adjustment Disorder, with the triggers being a relationship breakup 1.5 years ago, the pandemic and the rigor of a PhD. I really disagree with their assessment.

Firstly, the triggers don't make sense because I've been struggling with these issues for years, and I told them that. Secondly, they acknowledged that I am, in fact, exhibiting enough clinically significant ADHD symptoms currently to be diagnosed with ADHD if they only looked at the current time. And yet, their suggestion was just to get talk therapy. I feel this entirely misses the point. Thirdly, they looked at each issue individually and gave it an alternative explanation, instead of taking it all together as a whole. For instance, for the grades and subjects I did struggle with, I probably just have a learning disorder. For my inability to make solid interpersonal friendships, I have anxiety. For my inability to get work done and focus, it's mild depression. And, they asked me for more time to finish my evaluation because they needed more supervision and time as they were unsure about my diagnosis. If I'm on the line enough that they were unsure, I feel that diagnosing me with something that absolutely does not make sense and just disregarding the whole picture was irresponsible.

This process took me 2.5 months and about $200. I do not think I was adequately evaluated, but I'm just not sure, with how arduous the process is, if it is worth trying to get a second opinion. I am currently getting therapy to address my lack of productivity, but it is not working. I have also been on SSRIs for 3 months with no real apparent change. I feel like I've used up my options, and I don't know what to do.

I am currently getting therapy to address my lack of productivity, but it is not working. I have also been on SSRIs for 3 months with no real apparent change. I feel like I&amp;#39;ve used up my options, and I don&amp;#39;t know what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: despite my struggles and having &amp;quot;clinically significant ADHD&amp;quot; symptoms currently, I did not meet enough criteria for a diagnosis and was given Adjustment Disorder. Their reasoning was wrong IMO, but I don&amp;#39;t know if it is worth trying to get re-evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;

Happened more often than not.

But when I looked back, the sensation of waiting for something is one that I feel all the time. Like a constant part of my existence.

My hypothesis is this -

This waiting sensation is experienced on both a macro AND micro scale. Let me explain

The internal engine makes you feel like you have to do something, like something you're meant to do. Like some bullshit unknown destiny or something.

Despite not knowing what exactly, you have to do it, and soon. Mix this with time blindness, who knows how long that will be...

So until the time for you to do it arrives, you'll seat there quietly. Then you get this confusing feeling of not being able to do anything although you know you have to. So boom! Executive dysfunction.

What do you guys think? any merit to this?

361,,ADHD,"Wanted to share my experience with Foquest as medication for ADHD. It's a newer and possibly Canadian drug without a lot of reviews so this is just to add to that. I've been on it for almost a year now. I'm a woman in my mid-20s. 

I have gone from 25 to 35 to 45. Not much of a difference between the three- it just gets increasingly more powerful. I would say the **45 causes a bit of dizziness, though.** 

I remember being worried about feeling like a zombie or over-hyped, but **mood-wise I just felt completely normal.** The only difference was that I've always been the kind of person to fall asleep as soon as my head hits the pillow, and I would have to actually ""decide"" to go to bed. 

The first week I was doing things like vacuuming my room for the first time (ever). 

I found it much **easier to keep track of time-** I wasn't getting caught up in things and overestimating how much time I had. 

I wasn't scolded at work for dancing or speaking inappropriately- it was like **I was able to ""read the room"" all of a sudden. My voice isn't as loud and I don't sound as anxious.** More conscious with my words. 

School-wise, I have a 30-minute maximum attention span. I remember one day I realized that I had just spent **6 hours (straight) working on an assignment.** That has never happened before. In those 6 hours, I was **able to go to the washroom or get more coffee and still be able to return directly to my work.** 

If I went a day or two without taking them, I didn't feel any different. Just more tired and falling asleep earlier, and less motivated, but **there's no ""withdrawal**"" if you want to take a day or weekend off (at least for me, but I'm not a doctor so this is not advice). 

All in all, Foquest feels like a very safe choice- it's nothing drastic and if you aren't monitoring your symptoms you might hardly even notice. For me, it was an aha moment after a week realizing I had been actually following my schedule and getting things done.

367,,ADHD,"Hey Reddit

I'm an actor. I've loved every messy and difficult part of pursuing acting for the last 3 years – but something happened to me last fall that had a more profound effect on me than I initially thought. This is a really difficult thing for me to talk about, but I've been suffering in silence for months because I didn't feel like anyone in my life would understand. 

I signed to a small agency in haste last spring after being dropped unexpectedly by my previous agent the previous fall (2019)  In hindsight, I should have taken more time to vet this person but I was just so excited at the prospect of being represented again that I rushed into things.

There were warning signs that this person was very manipulative, but again I ignored them and pushed them off

""That's just how the industry works""

Everything came to a head when I sent in a self-tape that was apparently all wrong (By industry standards it was perfectly fine). We spoke on the phone and she began to insult me by questioning my intentions of being an actor.

*""Why did you want to become an actor? Tell me honestly why this is what you want to do.""*

*""Do you think you're even ready for this profession?""*

*""I never have to tell my other clients these things""*

*""Have you even done a self-tape before? What's going to happen when I send you into an audition room?""*

These we're obviously incredibly insulting questions. I was signed to a top-tier talent agency for two years. I've auditioned for leads in Netflix shows, I've almosted booked small roles next to huge names in the industry. I get seen by casting directors on a regular basis who are notorious for being difficult to audition for. I am unflinching polite, professional, and kind. I love what I do and I've worked incredibly hard to establish myself as reliable and fun to work with.

But I'm also a people pleaser and a pushover sometimes, especially when someone is upset with me. I get scared...

In a panic, I blurted out **""I have ADHD.""** 

I was about to explain to her that sometimes my ADHD causes me to make small mistakes and miss details in breakdowns, and that I was sorry and I would make sure to double-check everything before I sent my next tape... but before I could even finish she started grilling me.

*""Oh, I see... Well, I knew something was up with you. You clearly have some anxiety.""*

*""Are you medicated?""*

*""Is this a new problem or an old problem?""*

*""Of course these things always come out later... so explain to me how you manage that.""*

*""How am I supposed to trust that you'll be able to do your job if you book a role? Film sets are stressful, how are you going to manage that?""* 

*""I have so many actors not working right not because of 'mental health'.""*

I just didn't even know what to say. I've never had someone so blatantly tell me that they thought I was incapable of doing my job because of my disability. The arts industry is generally a more safe space for disabled folks, at least in my experience. 

Long story short, I told this agent to kick rocks. She was batshit. My mentor said something that really stuck with me ""Would you let a friend speak to you this way? This is a bad relationship, and we don't stay in bad relationships."" 

Though I was lucky that my friends and family supported me through this ordeal, I'm still traumatized. It really opened my eyes to ableism in the film/ arts industry. My confidence is still so shaken. Every time I try to do something related to acting I almost have a panic attack. Her words just ring in my head over and over again. Things are going back to normal soon and I want to be able to jump back into it, but I don't know how to get rid of this fear. 

I want to be proud of my disability. I want to show other aspiring actors with developmental disabilities that they have a place in this industry.

I am planning on using the dopamine method via sugary drinks and coffee as a reward system and working from home isn't the best for studying these things.

Painted the dining room recently. All furniture is in the hallway.

377,,ADHD,"First post here, and first Reddit post! This is a bit of a rant as well, but there are some questions I have that I hope I can get answers to. To start, I am not yet diagnosed however I have recently learned that my Mother, Brother, and Uncle had been diagnosed with ADHD. I have taken every online self-test, lurked here for the past couple of months, and I relate to a huge majority of the experiences I read about here.

I first suspected I had ADHD around six months ago (I think?) I had heard about some of the symptoms from who knows where and went on to read more about it and take some online tests. From there I was half in denial, and half thinking, ""How much more obvious could it have been, looking back?"" I remember checking most except for maybe two boxes on these questions and thinking, ""Doesn't everyone do that?"" No bud, as it turns out, most people don't lack the motivation to brush their teeth or to learn to drive, don't have crushing impulsivity, or cannot process emotions.

It became obvious that the constant struggle in school and on to college was not due to sheer laziness or lack of intelligence. Failing classes, forgetting to do work, failing to turn in completed work, the massive unorganized zipper binder, useless after school tutoring, multiple detentions, getting kicked out of kindergarten, the utter bombing of my college classes (two semesters in a row), scoring academic probation for poor performance, a late arrival to everything, not absorbing any information, and chilling in the library instead of going to calculus class altogether (but still attending the exam for some reason??)

I've discovered that other people don't typically have a radio in their head with the same playlist and with no control over it (It was playing the Day-O Banana Boat song today btw). And let me tell you, I wish I had a better singing voice because you better believe me when I tell you that my family doesn't appreciate the entertainment of me yelling ""DAAAAY-O DAaaaAAy-O"" from my bedroom. My dogs must think I'm insane when I bark at them (is this Tourette's syndrome or hyperactivity?) I'll also start unwanted games of tag with family, and I'll pace around the house with no goal in mind (I'm in my early 20's).

To get back on topic... so I expected I had ADHD (not knowing my family history at this time) about 6 months ago IIRC. Two months from there (4 mo. ago) I wrestled all week with my insurance's garbage website to change my doctor (I hadn't seen my old pediatrician for two years previously... gotta love procrastination.) After getting my new card in the mail... I did nothing for two months after that (did I think the appointment would make itself, hello?) Two months later (2 mo. ago) I battled myself for a week to make a phone call to make my first appointment (I'll do it tomorrow for sure... Oh would you look at that, it's the weekend now, guess I have to wait some more!) So it's finally time for my first appointment with my new PCP at the end of February.

At my first appointment, we restart medication for an unrelated health issue (Asthma, a lung condition), and I mention my concern that I have ADHD. My doctor doesn't diagnose so she sends a referral for Neuropsychology. They set up an appointment for a month later to adjust my lung medication if needed. They also tell me to call them if the referral doesn't call me to make an appointment for my ADHD diagnosis. Unrelated, but a week later I get my COVID vaccine (be safe people!) That next week I send a message through Mychart letting the office know I haven't got a call.

They then respond explaining that they don't accept my insurance and it must have been why I didn't get a call from them (""Why did you refer me there, then?"" I want to say. They ask me to find someone who accepts my insurance they can fax my referral to. Cue the garbage insurance website cycle again and after hours of searching for a provider, I give them the number of a provider. The time for my follow-up appointment rolls around a month after the first. We adjust my lung medication, and they say that the referral had been approved. My PCP says to call them again if the psych doesn't call me. Weeks pass, and I find that **THE PROVIDER LISTED ON MY INSURANCE WEBSITE DOESN'T PRACTICE ANYMORE?**

Repeat some back and forth until my next appointment and turns out my second personal recommendation falls through as well, turns out that the office had several negative reviews. That, and they didn't respond to my voicemail or calls after I missed a call from them. So here we are, three strikes down. I send over another office, making sure to confirm they do still exist before I go through this headache again. Everything seems in order.

So after the referral posts as ""Approved"" in Mychart, I fight myself for a week to make a call to make an appointment, but the weekend rolls over and today is the Tuesday I called (Anxiety?) So at like 2:00 PM, I gather enough motivation to call the office and even compose out possible paths the conversation can go on a notepad (Why? I don't know.) The receptionist tells me they aren't accepting new patients... *sigh* **BUT** they do give me two local places they have been referring people to. I'm glad I researched because it turns out one of them claims they provide ""spiritual treatment."" I go with the other option and miraculously they have an opening as soon as **tomorrow**. The receptionist said that is ""Unheard of"" and that the waitlist is up to the end of April. You better believe I took that opening.

But... they did warn me that they do not prescribe stimulant medications to unemployed people. I am currently unemployed by choice because of a fear of COVID in our United States, where wearing a mask seems to be optional in a redder state (remember my lung disorder?) I did complete my second vaccine, but I still fear for my family, as they are not yet vaccinated, and are vulnerable. Anyways my question is, are non-stimulant medications worse than stimulant medications? What should I expect from my appointment tomorrow?

380,,ADHD,"So I asked a question about if my ADHD would ruin my GameDev/Programmer career.
I got so much positive feedback and I think that I can do it. I can’t focus while watching game dev videos. It’s not that I’m not interested it’s just that I don’t have much to do while doing them. I’m getting a PC soon so I can probably focus better because I can like copy basic code or something idk if you know what I mean than you do. 

I could barely focus in class I just can’t. I still can’t in Online Class. That wouldn’t change anything but I feel more comfortable when I’m using technology. I like it. Anyways I feel like I can become a Game Developer. I can’t give away a game idea because I’m nervous someone will steal it, I have a friend I can talk to. He’s my only friend, but he’s a good one.

I joined this sever today and I already relate to a lot of the posts here. I feel kinda comfortable here. Also I would like to add that I’m trying to learn Java, Python, Unity, and Unreal Engine. I’m also learning Blender through Articles. It’s hard to pay attention but it’s working better, I really want to watch the videos because it could still help a lot. I need all the help I can get, I do not have a PC but I’m still going to learn as much as possible. ADHD (I call it ADD because I’m not really hyper) isn’t much of a problem for me but it’s not that great either.

I want to be the best Game Dev ever. I’ll try not to let ADD/ADHD stop me.


I would also like to add that I do not know much about ADHD/ADD. I learned that I have it like a year ago. I always felt distracted my whole life. Always hard to listen to the teachers. I daydream all the time during Online School. I always knew my Mom had it though. She also told me 10,000 times probably more can’t remember.

I got so much positive feedback and I think that I can do it. I can’t focus while watching game dev videos. It’s not that I’m not interested it’s just that I don’t have much to do while doing them. I’m getting a PC soon so I can probably focus better because I can like copy basic code or something idk if you know what I mean than you do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could barely focus in class I just can’t. I still can’t in Online Class. That wouldn’t change anything but I feel more comfortable when I’m using technology. I like it.

\*wonders if I'm even in the right place\*

\*thinks I should probably search to make sure this hasn't already been covered in another post\*

\*gives up, thinks about not posting\*

(yeah, I'm definitely in the right place)

(TL;DR at the bottom)

So here's the thing. I had a gnarly panic attack last week (9/10) that necessitated a trip to the ER. Those details are not necessary (of course I was ignored/treated like garbage), but I'm trying to figure out the big picture and I'm just not sure how I can go on. I need to know if there are others out there with this same combination of stuff and what you're doing to manage it, because I feel like I've been through every possible option and nothing is working.

(I am seeing a therapist and several providers who are all very nice and supportive and I am not looking to just try something without running it by all of them. I just need some outside validation/support/ideas from others in the same situation.)

I have a lot of ADHD and anxiety.

I also have a lot of depression and fatigue. I have sleep apnea, which I've had my entire life, or at least since I was a teen. It went undiagnosed for a long time because doctors assume that BMI is the only indicator, and I'm a fairly skinny dude. Anyway. Sleep apnea and depression not only share symptoms, but they exacerbate each other: depression makes me want to sleep constantly, and sleep apnea ensures that my sleep is not restful. The apnea is successfully being treated via CPAP, which I love and have no problems with, but it doesn't stop me from feeling fatigued all the damn time.

(I also have some trauma, PTSD, gender + body dysmorphia...I think that's about it)

\*tangent check\* - okay, not too bad so far

Here's what my life looks like: I'm tired all the time, from the time I wake up until the time I go to bed. I am also frantic all the time about not being able to do all the stuff I need to do.

This is, obviously, a problem.

I found out a couple of years ago that \[substance that I am not allowed to mention here\] cures my anxiety completely. Yay! Except it comes with its own lovely set of side effects (memory loss, couch lock, increased fatigue), and it left me without the ability to do creative work. I'm a creative person—I love writing music, taking photos, making films—and while \[substance\] is lovely for inspiration, I found that all I was doing was \*thinking\* about this stuff all day and not \*doing\* any of it.

If I took an adderall or ritalin, I could get stuff done for about 4 hours. But most of the time, I didn't feel like taking it. I'd light up instead and just keep on doing nothing.

So I decided to quit about a month ago. Yay! I also started exercising, eating better, and generally trying to get out of the rut I've been in. That actually has been going pretty well.

Along those lines, when I saw my sleep doc a couple weeks back, I asked if I could switch to Concerta, in the hopes that extended release would keep me going for longer, and I could get into a rhythm of just taking it every morning. She was on board with that and we agreed to start on the lowest possible dose.

I took exactly one Concerta and then had a panic attack. That really set me back. I'm scared to take meds now, and that is a very bad thing (that I am actively working through with my providers). I'm not sure whether the Concerta directly caused the panic attack, but the two are close enough together that my body doesn't want anything to do with pills right now.

So what I'm feeling is I have to go back to \[substance\] because that's the only way I have ever figured out to successfully manage my anxiety. And just live with the fact that I won't be able to do the creative work I want to do. (I'm sorry if this isn't permitted. I'm not trying to talk about substance abuse here, just the choice of how to manage my particular combination of symptoms and to get some advice from others.)

Is anyone else dealing with this combination of things? How are you managing?

\*double-checks rules to make sure everything is cool\*

\*slight panic about where to put the TL;DR\*

TL;DR LOTS of ADHD/anxiety but also depression/fatigue. Anything I take to manage my ADHD/fatigue increases my anxiety, and anything I take to manage my anxiety increases my depression/fatigue. Also, a certain substance cures my anxiety, but leaves me creatively unfulfilled. But when I stopped, I started having panic attacks.

385,,ADHD,"Hey guys. I’ve been thinking a lot about my ADHD journey thus far and I’m feeling super discouraged. I feel like every time I talk to someone (with ADHD, or any other mental issue) and they start new meds, it seems like they know exactly how the med is effecting them and whether it’s positive or negative, and I genuinely never feel like that.

When I start a new medication, whether it be for ADHD or my anxiety or depression, I literally cannot tell if it’s even effecting me, no matter what dosage it is or type of med. I’m getting so frustrated with myself because it makes it really hard for me to go back to the doctor and explain how it’s working or if it’s working at all, and I know he’s probably getting annoyed with me or I’m becoming less believable to him.

I was on Vyvanse a couple months ago, and I told him I didn’t notice much but thought I was on the right track so he increased it for the next month, but then I told him I didn’t know if it was working (again). Now I’m on Adderall XR (a lower dose, I might add), and I always read about how people with ADHD or ADD try new medications and are so amazed with how it helps them or even cry because they finally feel right, and I want that so badly and I can’t seem to ever get there.

I’m getting so frustrated with myself because it makes it really hard for me to go back to the doctor and explain how it’s working or if it’s working at all, and I know he’s probably getting annoyed with me or I’m becoming less believable to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was on Vyvanse a couple months ago, and I told him I didn’t notice much but thought I was on the right track so he increased it for the next month, but then I told him I didn’t know if it was working (again). Now I’m on Adderall XR (a lower dose, I might add), and I always read about how people with ADHD or ADD try new medications and are so amazed with how it helps them or even cry because they finally feel right, and I want that so badly and I can’t seem to ever get there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I just need words of encouragement, or someone else that also experiences this? Maybe just some advice? I’m not sure. I feel kind of unfixable lmao. Sorry for the long rant 😅&lt;/p&gt;

My partner and I are both DX and medicated, and while we both also love to cook, love to try new things and we do order out about 1x/week, after a year in pandemic lockdown we had run into our wits end when it came to figuring out what to cook and what groceries to buy for it while staying in our budget.  A few weeks ago I had a complete meltdown over it and refused to make any further decisions over food. It was bad. I ate little more than cereal and rage for several days.

After I calmed down and thought rationally about the situation, I decided to throw some money at the problem, and I looked into recipe planning services before settling on one. It does have an annual cost after the free 10 day trial, which is not a trivial amount of money to spend up front. We had briefly considered a meal delivery kit service, but ultimately decided that it wasn't best for us and our needs.  

Friends, we are only on our second week but this has already been a game changer for us. I wanted to share my experience for anyone else out there who is struggling to figure out how to feed themselves without going crazy, broke, or bored to death.

# What has a meal planning service done for us ADHDers, exactly?

1. It plans as many meals for us as we want it to during a 1 week period, so **no more having to think about how many meals we can get out of what we are buying for the week.** We were both really bad at that and usually ran out of any meaningful amount of food by Friday.
2. It will incorporate ingredients that we already have in our pantry, so **we don't have to figure out what TF to do with the rest of that bag of &lt;*****insert random ingredient here*****&gt;**.
3. It will re-use some of the same ingredients for several meals, so **we get the benefit of economies of scale and it saves us money in the long run.** For example, the first week we tried it, carrots were used in 2 or 3 different recipes and in very different ways so we didn't get sick of it.
4. It's adding waaaaaaay more variety to our diets because **we don't have to think up new and creative things to make.** Hello novelty, goodbye food boredom! Makes our particular brand of ADHD brains happy!
5. **It has put a ton more fruit and veg into our diets** because I told it that we both have some weight goals to hit.  We're both also emotional stress eaters who love our carbs. Not that carbs are evil or bad, but it did mean that we focused more on buying and making those than on produce, which has not helped our health.
6. On the above point, because almost everything we buy now has a specific purpose, **the fruit and veg aren't going bad because we couldn't be arsed to figure out how to use them**.
7. It connects to freaking Instacart and Amazon Fresh and tells it exactly what quantity of each ingredient to get, so **we don't have to spend the time to search for everything on our list one by one and also figure out how much of each thing to buy.**

&amp;#x200B;

# What doesn't this meal planning service do for us?

1. It doesn't send you any of the ingredients.  You still have to procure the goods.
2. It doesn't make you want to wash the dishes any more than you did before.  Sorry, mate.
3. It doesn't give you energy if you're feeling too tired to cook, although not having to make any decisions about what to make and how to make it has greatly reduced the mental load.
4. It doesn't plan more than a week at a time, so you can't just do your entire month at once and be done with it. Which is fine for us because it affords us the right level of flexibility for our needs.

&amp;#x200B;

# Bottom Line: This is Why a Meal Planning Service is ADHD Friendly

1. **It cuts waaaaay down on the mental load** of making decisions about what to cook, what to buy how much of each ingredient to get, how to use what you already have, etc.  That amount of decision making can be so overwhelming.
2. **It has given us so much more variety**, and our ADHD brains love the novelty!  Like I said, we both like to cook and try new things, but coming up with what to try, finding a decent recipe, and figuring out how to make it work without buying a bunch of ingredients you'll never use again is hard AF.
3. **It's balanced out our diet more**, which helps out with the ever-present guilt of not eating ""healthy enough"". Okay, some of that might also be our own personal food issues from childhood, but gravitating towards feel-good comfort food and away from fresh produce is not uncommon in our community.",t2_3993mhim,False,,0,False,How a Meal Planning Service Can Be ADHD Friendly,[],r/ADHD,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_m16gt4,False,light,1.0,,public,7,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Tips/Suggestions,False,7,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1615325603.0,text,0,,,text,self.ADHD,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Re-posting, as the original was removed, citing that it was an advertisement/self promotion.

394,,ADHD,"One year ago I was in my final year of undergrad for a design program. I was busy working part time at my college pub as a FOH team lead and trying my best to finish my thesis and graduate from my program. I started college back in 2013 and after a one year art program and about 2 years off from school, I was not about to fail and be forced to come back for another year. I was ready to begin my life as an adult….  
 

Fast forward to a year and while I did manage to graduate (THANK WHATEVER GOD THERE IS!) I I feel like I am much worse off than when I was almost failing classes in school… I am currently:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Unemployed
2. Ghosting a potential freelance client
3. Putting off my volunteer design work
4. Relying on my dad and the government for money so that I can feed myself and pay my rent
5. Absolutely miserable and completely bored with life. 

I know that my circumstances are not that different from others right now, and I am not special in anyway, but fuck this sucks!  
 

I haven’t improved anything about myself in one whole year. I am still a fucking mess, and I feel like even though I went to school I still have no skills that will make me stand out in any way to employers. I also just don’t even know if this is the industry (UX/UI Design) I want to be in.  
 

I seem to have this crippling like anxiety over doing anything that could potential help me. All I want to do is eat good food, and watch Superstore with my boyfriend on the couch all day long, but I also want to be successful and happy and have some kind of purpose in life. 

Anyways I don’t really know where I am going with this, I think younger me would be so disappointed and embarrassed with how I turned out. She wanted to make something of herself and prove to everyone that she was amazing and her life was interesting, but the older I get the more I realize that is just not the case. I am so average and so boring and kinda pathetic to be honest lol. I can totally understand why I don’t have very many friends, and I feel sorry for my parents for having such a loser of a daughter.   
 

ANYWAYS, I think I’m having all these feelings because I very recently started taking medication (18mg of Concerta) and I just kinda thought It was help solve my problems. I thought they were working and helping the first week of being on them, but now I am not so sure. I also find myself questioning my diagnosis A LOT. Some days I think “of course I have ADHD its so obvious!” And other days I think “Maybe you are just a lazy piece of shit with no potential”.

DOUBLE DISCLAIMER: Please do not diagnose me! I'm not asking for anyone to be a doctor, just need some advice with a side of ranting :')

So as a kid, I didn't think I had much problem with concentration when it came to classes, most likely because they didn't bore me and I actually enjoyed them for the ones I hated, my attention was zero. Obviously, I'm not saying that concentration is the biggest symptom, it's just the branch of multiple.

Also fidgeting, I need those to calm down and stimulate. Other than that there's the more serious symptoms which I've seen people with ADHD have which I relate to so much.

At the same time though, I'm scared to just go to a doctor and say, ""hey, I feel like I have ADHD can I get a diagnosis?"" Because I don't know how that would work.

400,,ADHD,"I’m looking for some advice as my head is about to explode. I’ve (27F) been in a relationship with an amazing guy (28M) for 5.5 years and he has untreated ADHD. I’ve educated myself for years trying to understand it and how to handle his outbursts and downright awful actions, I even bought him a book which he refused to read. Fast forward to now, we’ve broken up more times than I can count based on his actions which push me away. He has screamed at me, broken my things, threatened me, blocked me, given me the silent treatment for over a week, told me to pack my bags more times than I can count and then I realise there’s no helping him so I agree and leave. Usually within 2-4 weeks, he comes crawling back begging me to get back with him, promising he will research his ADHD and speak to someone and put some steps in place so I can help manage it too. Stupidly, because I love him, I forgive him and believed him. He’s nice as pie for a month or so and then the issues start again. He promises me he’ll talk to someone or at least research into it and he doesn’t which causes me to feel resentful towards him.

 To give you some context of my current situation, he bought himself an investment property 18 months ago for himself without telling me. He moved into it and I moved in with him part time until we saved for our own place. He kicked me out over 3 times and threatened me to pack my bags over 10 times. He then took a low paying job (part-time) and a high cost car therefore he couldn’t afford the mortgage although he told me he could, struggled with the financials and lied about it until eventually he kicked me out for good in November and moved back to his mums as he couldn’t afford to live there. After I forgave him (again), he promised me we would then get a place together as soon as someone rents his apartment. Someone is renting his apartment and I have completed all of the relevant steps in order to get us our first home (which is long overdue after 5 years) and I’ve done all of it by myself whilst he sits back making excuses. He then decides 3 months after looking for a property to dictate the budget (I had no say) and decrease it by £20k so he can have no less than £18k in his bank account after we agreed a fairly low budget to begin with. Every week for the last 3 months, he’s brought up new issues whether it’s relating to money or towards me and tries to make me feel like I’m doing something wrong when in my eyes, I’m just trying to find us a house together. 

I’ve been feeling pretty low during this last lockdown and I confided in him as he should WANT to support me but he threw it in my face and told me how much he hasn’t enjoyed my company recently and he’s not committed to a house due to my unhappiness. The next week, he completely changes and says how much he loves spending time with me and is even discussing our children’s names in the future?

The guy is all over the place with his emotions and I get the backlash. This last year, he’s had 3 jobs, 3 cars, 3 phones, argues with all of his coworkers, argues constantly with me and makes out he’s innocent in every scenario. He knows he has ADHD but he refuses to accept it. This last week, he’s blocked me, ended the relationship, told me he doesn’t love me and I’ve ruined his life all because I was frustrated that he broke his promises to research into his adhd, help me with the house search and not to give me the silent treatment.

The resentment I feel is crazy, I don’t believe anything he says anymore as he’s lied that many times about researching into his adhd so he can understand himself more and end this vicious cycle we are in. He thinks I’m the problem, he thinks I have a temper but the only time I’ll react is when he dictates and lies to me and he will sit there and point the finger to my responses to his actions and end the relationship.

He then took a low paying job (part-time) and a high cost car therefore he couldn’t afford the mortgage although he told me he could, struggled with the financials and lied about it until eventually he kicked me out for good in November and moved back to his mums as he couldn’t afford to live there. After I forgave him (again), he promised me we would then get a place together as soon as someone rents his apartment. Someone is renting his apartment and I have completed all of the relevant steps in order to get us our first home (which is long overdue after 5 years) and I’ve done all of it by myself whilst he sits back making excuses. He then decides 3 months after looking for a property to dictate the budget (I had no say) and decrease it by £20k so he can have no less than £18k in his bank account after we agreed a fairly low budget to begin with. Every week for the last 3 months, he’s brought up new issues whether it’s relating to money or towards me and tries to make me feel like I’m doing something wrong when in my eyes, I’m just trying to find us a house together. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been feeling pretty low during this last lockdown and I confided in him as he should WANT to support me but he threw it in my face and told me how much he hasn’t enjoyed my company recently and he’s not committed to a house due to my unhappiness. The next week, he completely changes and says how much he loves spending time with me and is even discussing our children’s names in the future?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guy is all over the place with his emotions and I get the backlash. This last year, he’s had 3 jobs, 3 cars, 3 phones, argues with all of his coworkers, argues constantly with me and makes out he’s innocent in every scenario. He knows he has ADHD but he refuses to accept it. This last week, he’s blocked me, ended the relationship, told me he doesn’t love me and I’ve ruined his life all because I was frustrated that he broke his promises to research into his adhd, help me with the house search and not to give me the silent treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resentment I feel is crazy, I don’t believe anything he says anymore as he’s lied that many times about researching into his adhd so he can understand himself more and end this vicious cycle we are in. He thinks I’m the problem, he thinks I have a temper but the only time I’ll react is when he dictates and lies to me and he will sit there and point the finger to my responses to his actions and end the relationship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this a lost cause??&lt;/p&gt;

402,,ADHD,"For those who don't know this yet, I apologize for the rabbit hole y'all are about to join me on.

For context, I've got some personal reasons why I need to know  ASAP  whether this should affect the birth control I currently use, but I think this could also be a bigger discussion about knowledge gaps in medicine, and why your primary/family doctor should know more about ADHD and how it relates to other Healthcare decisions.

Somehow in all the ADHD research I've been reading and articles about ADHD and women, I just learned today: ADHD symptoms and fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone may be connected. As in, higher levels of estrogen trigger a release of dopamine, and so when estrogen drops in the cycle, ADHD symptoms get worse. The hormone progesterone is suspected of also making ADHD symptoms worse, though I'm still trying to understand the mechanism, because the birth control i use is the synthetic version, progestin.

Studies are really limited, but I've been on the progestin releasing Nexplanon for over 2 years and am just about to get it out because I've been getting my period twice a month suddenly. Although it didn't last as long as it should, I liked it a lot more than the pill and other birth control options aren't good for my anxiety or require too much maintenance/routine/working memory. 

I've been a lot happier in the last few months, which coincides with more positive life events and support I've been getting from friends and family, but also coincides with the changes in my period. I don't think it's possible to tease out the variables, but now I'm worried that getting the nexplanon re-inserted (an out of pocket expense of $350 in BC, Canada) will cause me to spiral back into the depression I'm just coming out of. 

I take the maximum amount of adderall every day, and it would be interesting to know if a different birth control would mean that it would work better for me- but unless the changes are significant, I would rather try to stay on the same birth control and use other habit/exercise/dietary methods in addition addition medication and therapy to manage my ADHD. In the back of my mind, I wonder if women taking stimulants also have nexplanon implants expire sooner, if anyone else with Nexplanon could answer whether they had a similar experience?

Since I'm about to book my nexplanon replacement procedure, I'll be asking my doctor about this for sure. 

What do you all think? Have your doctors ever asked you about how your ADHD symptoms are impacted by the birth control you're on or your regular hormonal cycle? Studies also discuss the role that menopause &amp; pregnancy affect ADHD symptoms from the perspective of estrogen-dopamine interactions.

Part of how most ADHD medications work, and amphetamines, in particular, is through increasing dopamine levels or through making the brain process the neurotransmitter more slowly. It makes sense then that estrogen and progesterone would affect how the brain processes medications. For instance, taking estrogen generally makes ADHD medications more effective, and taking progesterone makes them less effective.

406,,ADHD,"Hey so im confused about my ADHA/ADD. First off im 30 years old and figured id have grown out of this by now but ive done some reasrch in the last couple years and came to the conclusion that i think i do actually have this condition. Throughout my life sespecially when i was younger i was super hyper and all the steriotypical symptoms of ADHD all my friends always told me that i had it and even some teachers told me i had it in jr high but i didnt want to belive them because of the narrow minded opinions of what my father said about it when i was younger and the social stigma of medications. 
I have been on adderall for the last 6 months... only 5 mg caps. It seems to help and i feel better when i take it i get alot more accoplished and overall feel better.
My issue lately is i feel guilt because im mostly just lazy and unproductive and un able to get basic easy shit done like chores and stuff that should just be easy like they are when i take my medication... i havent felt hyper so much latelyit comes in waves ... or used to i only get like one hyper day a month layely.  
Like i said before latey i just feel super lazy and unmotivated even though i eat heathy get excersise, have a decent sleep schedule and dont drink much alcohol mambe one or two after work here and there and maybe some on a friday night. I dont feel as ""spry and energetic as when i was younger i get that im an old man now kinda and that might be normal but seems like vasic stuff is such a ordeal so i just play videogames or watch iv feeling like shit about not being able to get anything done cuz any time i try i just cant focus or im onto the next thing before im even done the first thing. When i wasnt taking meds even talking to people i found myself just losing my train of though bcause in my head id get so far forward in my sentence that my id forget wat was actually coming out of my mouth... sounds so dumb i know but it was super frustrating!Taking my meds helps but i think i need to up my dose or sonething cuz its not as effective as it used to be. I just cant help but feel bad about it because of the stigma i was taught growing up. 
I guess im just writing this to vent or ... i dont even really know why... i guess to see if any of this is valid. I just find it hard to stay focused and motivated in a day and while at work and ever writing this is somewhat dificult to get through because my mind keeps wandering and i feel like im rambling.
I like how my medication makes my life easier but feel so shitty that im reliant on it to be productive and feel ""normal"". Ive tried to do cbt excersises and am disciplined in my routines (setting alarms,checklist, sticky notes). 
Today im just feeling frustrated and upset about this whole thing and dont really know where to turn to.

Throughout my life sespecially when i was younger i was super hyper and all the steriotypical symptoms of ADHD all my friends always told me that i had it and even some teachers told me i had it in jr high but i didnt want to belive them because of the narrow minded opinions of what my father said about it when i was younger and the social stigma of medications. 
I have been on adderall for the last 6 months... only 5 mg caps. It seems to help and i feel better when i take it i get alot more accoplished and overall feel better.
My issue lately is i feel guilt because im mostly just lazy and unproductive and un able to get basic easy shit done like chores and stuff that should just be easy like they are when i take my medication... i havent felt hyper so much latelyit comes in waves ... or used to i only get like one hyper day a month layely.&lt;br/&gt;
Like i said before latey i just feel super lazy and unmotivated even though i eat heathy get excersise, have a decent sleep schedule and dont drink much alcohol mambe one or two after work here and there and maybe some on a friday night. I dont feel as &amp;quot;spry and energetic as when i was younger i get that im an old man now kinda and that might be normal but seems like vasic stuff is such a ordeal so i just play videogames or watch iv feeling like shit about not being able to get anything done cuz any time i try i just cant focus or im onto the next thing before im even done the first thing. When i wasnt taking meds even talking to people i found myself just losing my train of though bcause in my head id get so far forward in my sentence that my id forget wat was actually coming out of my mouth... sounds so dumb i know but it was super frustrating!Taking my meds helps but i think i need to up my dose or sonething cuz its not as effective as it used to be. I just cant help but feel bad about it because of the stigma i was taught growing up. 
I guess im just writing this to vent or ... i dont even really know why... i guess to see if any of this is valid. I just find it hard to stay focused and motivated in a day and while at work and ever writing this is somewhat dificult to get through because my mind keeps wandering and i feel like im rambling.
I like how my medication makes my life easier but feel so shitty that im reliant on it to be productive and feel &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot;. Ive tried to do cbt excersises and am disciplined in my routines (setting alarms,checklist, sticky notes). 
Today im just feeling frustrated and upset about this whole thing and dont really know where to turn to.
Does anyone feel like me?&lt;/p&gt;

409,,ADHD,"Here's my life story about food lol, TLDR at the end.

I am recently (officially) diagnosed with ADHD and starting on a generic form of adderall. I managed to obtain an engineering degree and get my current work from home office job all while off medication and, while it was a nightmare logistically speaking, I was at least eating food more or less regularly. With the exception of caffeine fueled hyperfocused binge work all nighters lol. 

I have always been sensitive to heavy/high carb foods making me sleepy, but now that I am on medication, its way worse. In the past, if I was busy at work and didn't have time to take lunch I would throw on a pot of water and make rice or pasta and top it with sauce or butter, and whatever leftover protein I had in the fridge (if there was any). It's low effort, fast, and filling. On occasion these dishes would make me a little tired, but some green tea or a lot of water would do the trick and I would be good to go. Now, even a rice bowl or a dish with a little pasta will nearly knock me out (if I can manage to eat it). No amount of coffee, tea, soda, water, or jumping jacks will help. Usually it's so bad I can hardly focus on the computer screens in front of me with broad daylight coming in from the patio door next to me.

On top of all of that, I work at a medium-large bookkeeping and accounting firm doing all the back end admin. We recently got rid of the other admin worker too. You can imagine that any year we are busy right now since taxes are due soon. But with Covid issues, this year is insanely busy, worse than we have ever seen. I am working 55+ hours a week and hardly have time to cook/prep/make lunch and snacks. And all of my previous eat snacks/lunches are now out of the question with my medication. At this point, I've stopped eating.

411,,ADHD,"Inspired by an earlier post on using music to keep track of time in the shower I figured I'd share something that works for me. 

After hearing about the pomadoro method,  I bought a cheap mechanical kitchen egg timer that can go up to 60 minutes and it's a real game changer.
I don't actually follow the full pomadoro method as it's a bit too ridged for my brain. 

I just set it just as I start a task - to what time I think the task should take: e.g. 15 minutes for a shower,  10 minutes to clear my inbox,  60 minutes to clean up a corner of the kitchen. 
For things that definitely should have a deadline it helps keep me boxed in and for things like cleaning where I might actually reach ""stretch goals"" (like cleaning two corners of the kitchen) it helps me get started and set a minimum goal that I can tap out at if I'm still struggling at the end. 

It's great because:
- It provides an audible cue to stay on task as you can literally hear the seconds ticking by. 
- It's easy to check how much time has passed at a glance.

414,,ADHD,"Hey guys! So I am a 26 year old man that has struggled with OCD, BDD, anxiety, depression, and ADD/ADHD (although in the process of getting diagnosed with ADD/ADHD), for pretty much my entire life.

In late 2019 my situation became unbearable as I was failing school, had no job, and to top it off I was struggling with severe nerve pain in my arm from a botched blood draw.

I ended up going to a psychiatrist and he prescribed me lexapro 10 mg/day which I took for a month. I ended up getting sexual side effects and fatigue, and my doctor thought I should try trintellix instead. Once I started that the sexual side effects dissipated fairly quickly but I was left with the fatigue which for me was honestly much worse. I started on 10 mg/day and over a period of 6 weeks increased my dose to 20 mg/day because I thought a higher dose would be more beneficial.

I have taken 20 mg/day for more than a year now and it has done absolute wonders for my depression, and my OCD, BDD and anxiety symptoms have decreased too although not as much and I still struggle with that. However, the trintellix has made me very tired and lethargic, and I lack motivation to do things as well as before.

As I said earlier I also strongly suspect I have ADD/ADHD. It’s been something that has plagued my entire life since the age of 5-6, but I still haven’t received a proper diagnosis even though doctors have indicated that they believe I have it too. I’m currently in the process of getting it diagnosed but where I live in Sweden, it will take at least a year before I get my diagnosis. Going private, I would get it much faster, but I can’t afford that atm.

I discussed all these issues with my psychiatrist today and she seemed to indicate that I perhaps could add Wellbutrin to help with the tiredness, lack of concentration and motivation? She can’t prescribe “proper” ADD/ADHD medications like concerta, ritalin or elvanse before I get a proper diagnosis, and so this was the option given to me.

Has anyone combined Trintellix with Wellbutrin? Why are you on this combination of meds? What dosages are you on? Have they worked well for you? Any tips are appreciated!

So I am a 26 year old man that has struggled with OCD, BDD, anxiety, depression, and ADD/ADHD (although in the process of getting diagnosed with ADD/ADHD), for pretty much my entire life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late 2019 my situation became unbearable as I was failing school, had no job, and to top it off I was struggling with severe nerve pain in my arm from a botched blood draw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up going to a psychiatrist and he prescribed me lexapro 10 mg/day which I took for a month. I ended up getting sexual side effects and fatigue, and my doctor thought I should try trintellix instead. Once I started that the sexual side effects dissipated fairly quickly but I was left with the fatigue which for me was honestly much worse. I started on 10 mg/day and over a period of 6 weeks increased my dose to 20 mg/day because I thought a higher dose would be more beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have taken 20 mg/day for more than a year now and it has done absolute wonders for my depression, and my OCD, BDD and anxiety symptoms have decreased too although not as much and I still struggle with that. However, the trintellix has made me very tired and lethargic, and I lack motivation to do things as well as before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said earlier I also strongly suspect I have ADD/ADHD. It’s been something that has plagued my entire life since the age of 5-6, but I still haven’t received a proper diagnosis even though doctors have indicated that they believe I have it too. I’m currently in the process of getting it diagnosed but where I live in Sweden, it will take at least a year before I get my diagnosis. Going private, I would get it much faster, but I can’t afford that atm.&lt;/p&gt;

419,,ADHD,"This is my first time ever posting, and I've cross-posted as it involves abuse, narcissistic parents, mental health and mental age. I've been a lurker for awhile and have found so many stories of people who have similar experiences and its encouraged me to share my own story now. trying to keep it as brief as possible, I was born in the mid80s, was a 90s kid, a teenager in the early 2000s. My entire life back to my earliest memories was filled with abuse and out of control rage. there's maybe 1 or 2 good memories sprinkled in my whole childhood/youth, and they dont involve my family. My dad was my main abuser. My mom stood by and did nothing and has gaslit me my entire life that none of it happened. Starting from my earliest memories I remember him hitting my mom across the face, chasing me through the house everyday hitting me...dinnertimes from my childhood have scarred me, i was expected to sit ""properly"": both feet planted flat on the ground, i always want to sit cross legged or sitting on one foot or one leg bent up and the other one bent underneath me, and no elbows on the table, had to ""hold my knife and fork properly"", i would get in trouble even for how i placed my knife and fork down on the plate, there's apparently a right way to set down your cutlery on the plate and apparently this was an extremely important thing i needed to learn in life (sarcasm). My dad wouldn't just snap at me for this, i had to sit beside him i wasnt allowed to sit away from him, he would kick me under the table, pinch my arm or elbow me if i did anything ""wrong"" at the dinner table. So i have this huge negative memory surrounding eating, contributing to my 22 years of eating disorder. so now as an adult I make it a point that eating time is a time to feel the most comfortable, relaxed, i make it an enjoyable almost spiritual experience now. I sit how i want, however my body feels comfortable, i dont give a shit about elbows or any dumb shit. when i have meals now i treasure the time and make it a nice happy positive experience. This is one of the ""minor"" abuses from my dad but had a huge negative impact on me. The majority of the abuse was him chasing me thru the house hitting me as I'm trying to run away from him. My mom witnessed almost all of the abuse. she would stand there in the doorway yelling ""john stop!"" but not actually doing anything or trying to stop him, she also never came to me after to see if i was ok or comfort me, no. All through my childhood i was blamed as being the most horrible child and i was deserving of the ""discipline"" as they called it. They told me straight up that its not abuse if it's with an open hand. Gotta love being a 90s kid. I feel like if I had been born in the next generation and had access to a smart phone i would have had the evidence to help myself get out of that situation, not to mention as time has progressed and sociey is realizing that hitting kids is wrong and its not discipline its abuse. I could've had voice and video recordings and hard proof , since no one believed i was being abused. i think he was very strategic in how hard he hit me so as not to leave bruises, but he left red marks all the time and bruises at some times, and always on areas of my body that could be covered by clothes. My dad is a rageaholic. not just him hitting me it was him raging as he's chasing me and hitting me. Tearing off my bedroom door for all of ages 13-14, ripping off all the pictures on my wall some of it my own artwork, he did this all the time and one night i snapped and went into a psychosis (13 at the time), my dad was in one of his rage moments destroying my bedroom so i got a big butcher knife and started walking up the stairs to my room...in that moment i wanted to go up and slit my wrists in front of him but i wasn't sure if i could stop myself there. Mom's screaming the whole time. He came down the stairs and grabbed the knife from me, cutting up his whole hand in the process (karma), we all go to the hospital and i vaguely remeber this cause it was so traumatic, but i spoke with a psychologist/psychiatrist at the hospital but i have zero recollection of that conversation, i remember sitting in the room and talking to someone but not what was said. but it resulted in us all being sent home, no counseling no child services got involved. Then at 15 one night i have to go meet him at his office &amp; i thought my sister was there too, i get there and its only him. he proceeds to grab me, throw me in to the elevator, hitting and pushing me around and yelling at me in the elevator ride threating to kill me, we get to his office and he's trying to rip my bag away from me (crossbody bag), he then starts choking me lifting my entire body up off the ground and holding me up by my neck against the wall. when we got back home i immediately said to my mom that he just choked me and i described in detail and she straught up called me a liar and i made it all up and how horrible i am to be making these horrible accusations against my father. oh and he was also covertly sexually abusing me too but i didn't even realize that it ""counted"" until i spoke with a therapist in my 20s, and she confirmed yes i was sexually abused as well by my dad. its so sickening i couldn't even think the thought even now just saying it is a first. But apparently all of the memories of my entire childhood are false, according to my mom. How can this be false when I remember these things all throughout my childhood? how is every single memory i have false? how is it false when i have been diagnosed depression since 16 which is now major depressive disorder, major anxiety and panic disorder, self harm and past suicide attempts, PTSD, night terrors and sleep paralysis, constant dissociating, waking flashbacks and flashbacks all day until i can finally achieve sleep, which i can only achieve with smoking green so now i have to rely on that to get me through the turmoil i feel inside. I believe im also undiagnosed ADHD and Asperger's or on the autism spectrum anyway, and so my parents abused and neglected a disabled kid. It was already so bad but finding these things out about myself being adhd and autistic made it feel even worse like, i was so mistreated and abused, i should have had help and supports for my conditions and their abuse made it 1000 times worse. Im 34 now and feel mentally like i never grew past a teenager age, thats how i feel inside.

420,,ADHD,"I'll start this off by saying I have ADHD, been diagnosed since Grade 2 back in '00/'01. I am now 27. The beginning of this isn't particularly ADHD related, but it becomes relevant halfway down as it's treatment may be what leads to my death. It's long, but I appreciate anyone's assistance. I added a TL;DR paragraph to sum up the story for you, and 

**-Marfanoid habitus-**

I recently found out that I am technically considered a [Marfanoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marfanoid). I fit every description, but have not been diagnosed with any of the disorders that cause it. My arm span to body height ratio is 1.09. (Arm Span: 6'4"", Height: 5'10"") My teeth are fucked and overcrowded, my fingers AND TOES are abnormally long (fingers not so much, only noticeable compared to other family members fat short fingers, but toes are pretty apparent compared to everyone).  All of these are some of the apparent physical signs of [Marfan Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marfan_syndrome).  Other than ""Sometimes it do be like that,"" this is probably the best and most realistic cause, all other disorders are pretty severe and would have been picked up in my youth. The only thing is, Marfan Syndrome requires a mix of medical tests to obtain a diagnosis: DNA gene mutation presence, and/or echocardiograms, and/or Skeletal Xrays, and/or other random flexibility tests to diagnose. The process is underway to get these tests, but these will take time.

It also means that if I have Marfan Syndrome, I more than likely have a fucked up valve in my heart, and possibly a widened Aorta (among other muscular, skeletal, and musculoskeletal problems that may arise with this connective tissue affecting genetic disorder). This only serves to worsen with age, and can lead to possible fatal complications such as heart failure and aortic aneurysm.

That being said, I am the first in my entire family to have this disorder (unless my mom cheated and my real bio dad has it) which means this was a 1 in 20,000 chance of happening according to current research/studies (Affects 1 in 5,000 people, 3/4 of them have a parent that also had it.) It really does not matter HOW I got it, what matters the most to me is that these studies also show that a parent with Marfan Syndrome has a 50% chance to pass it to their offspring. So because I have it, my daughters chances of having it are 1 in 2. She has my abnormally long toes. (You know abnormally long toes when you see them. Multiple toes are longer than or equal in length to the big toe.)

**-ADHD-**

All this information, couple with my long-term and continued stimulant use for my ADHD diagnosis I received in Grade 2, I do not expect to live long with the heart I was born with. One day I may just not wake up, or collapse dead on the floor due to a burst aortic aneurysm. This is ok with me. I have grown fine with the idea of dying, and have always been open minded about it. Other people are not as cool with me dying, as I am with me dying. What worries me the most now is leaving my young daughter behind and her going her entire life without being understood like me. 

I know my ex, I know her family, I know my parents. They all knew relatively early on in their corresponding relationships with me that I had ADHD. None of them did any research on it to this day and are still shocked every time they see me do things, or more specifically NOT doing things that I should be doing. Most of these occurrences can be adequately explained by an area of Executive Functioning being affected. 

I went my whole life believing I was a screw up for struggling to keep up with my peers, only for me to realize in adulthood they were trying to teach a fish to climb a mountain. I had the classic constant feeling of being a failure, pretty characteristic of the undiagnosed ADHD experience, while also being on a stimulant that I, as a child, thought was essentially a vitamin. Every time I'd act up, I'd hear ""did you take your pill?"" from any one of my direct family members, sister included (two years younger than me, literally did not know any better, feels bad about it today). Developed 0 coping mechanisms for ADHD, only an unhealthy reliance on my pills and parents. I had no idea what stimulants did or that they each have side affects because my parents refused to believe I was different throughout my entire childhood and into my teens. To them, the more quiet I was the better.

**-Inheritence-**

I don't think any of them seriously consider that there is a 40-50% chance that my daughter has ADHD simply because I have it. Let alone all the environmental factors in her upbringing, and known family history of psychiatric illness in my ex's family (Schizophrenia (her dad's side only), drug abuse and ADHD-like symptoms across the board for all half-relatives of ex), as well as my family history (Bipolar (me, cousin), ADHD (cousin)). They also have no clue that ADHD symptoms generally appear different in females from the stereotypical ""hyper-boy"" disorder that the mainstream media portrays, and most ADHD females go undiagnosed because of this, only seeking help once they find out that information is false.

They adamantly deny, shut down and belittle my opinion when I tell them she experiences clear signs of ADHD in all group lessons she is in. Skating, swimming, gymnastics, etc. She walks (or swims) away from her group mid-lesson, and does her own thing. Not paying attention to the actual lesson, and eventually ""failing"" and having to retake the course (Except gymnastics, those are age based levels, not at all skill based unless you're going competitive). 

They pass it off as ""Oh she's just like every other kid."" which is clearly untrue since she's the only one breaking away from the group, and other kids are passing the course. The worst I've heard is ""Oh she's just like you."" to which I replied ""No shit, that's the problem. I have ADHD."" If the lesson is 1 on 1, she has no issue and excels because she's not as afraid to ask questions, and she's under constant supervision and being held accountable by that.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** 

I'm in a catch 22. I may have been born with Marfan Syndrome, which can easily have been passed to my child, and affects the heart/aorta structure. I also definitely was born with or developed ADHD early in my youth due to a mix of genetics and environmental factors. The main and most effective treatment for ADHD is typically stimulants. Stimulants are shown to cause heart damage over time. I have been taking stimulants or another since Grade 2 (20 years on stimulants total, 10 of them I was taking Adderall XR 30mg). In order for me to function at socially tolerable level, I require a stimulant. Non-stimulant treatment has shown to be not effective for me. I also don't want to die of heart failure and would like to see my daughter live to adulthood at least.

Facts are the only thing keeping me functioning in society, may be the thing that kills me at a young age, and I may have inadvertently doomed my daughter to repeat it based on my shitty genetics.

I know this isn't particularly ADHD related and may be best suited for another forum, but I always found the ADHD community to be much more open minded, with the most range in helpful advice. Most others just turn into a toxic echo chamber.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-Marfanoid habitus-&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently found out that I am technically considered a &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marfanoid""&gt;Marfanoid&lt;/a&gt;. I fit every description, but have not been diagnosed with any of the disorders that cause it. My arm span to body height ratio is 1.09. (Arm Span: 6&amp;#39;4&amp;quot;, Height: 5&amp;#39;10&amp;quot;) My teeth are fucked and overcrowded, my fingers AND TOES are abnormally long (fingers not so much, only noticeable compared to other family members fat short fingers, but toes are pretty apparent compared to everyone).  All of these are some of the apparent physical signs of &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marfan_syndrome""&gt;Marfan Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;.  Other than &amp;quot;Sometimes it do be like that,&amp;quot; this is probably the best and most realistic cause, all other disorders are pretty severe and would have been picked up in my youth.

421,,ADHD,"I have a new doctor and am feeling conflicted. Looking for advice / insight.

Brief background:  I am 26. Growing up, my parents suspected I had ADHD (I definitely had anxiety too but it manifested in small infrequent ways and didn’t get much worse until I got older.) As with many women, I was so “accomplished” academically and with extracurriculars that I went undiagnosed until I was 19, a year after I barely graduated high school.

My psychiatrist prescribed me strattera and a low dose of adderall (the adderall came after I had an allergic reaction to a different stimulant.) I finally had some self control in terms of my hyperactivity, I stopped shouting out as much in school and my confidence improved greatly because I was doing well in college. 

I stopped taking adderall my senior year... because I became really depressed for a number of reasons and just didn’t feel like taking my meds or doing work. Or anything really. My doctor actually called my parents because she was concerned that I hadn’t come to get my monthly prescriptions for the  rest of my school years. 


Anyway, I moved across the country this past year and have a meeting psychiatrist. I really like him and he doesn’t take insurance, but I am paying out of pocket because it’s worth it to invest in myself and have a great doctor.

He saw that I was allergic to the first stimulant medication I was prescribed and asked about my allergic reaction (which was actually kinda gnarly lol I got excused from one of my first exams for it to take later!)  and then asked me about the strattera. 

He asked if it helped. I said “I think so.” He asked if my grades went up. I replied that they did. But I didn’t mention that I had also been prescribed adderall as a supplement to my strattera. Honestly, I would not have made it through college without the combo of those two meds. But I felt guilty for that / would have felt guilty for telling him that, despite the fact that I was prescribed these meds because I needed them, so I didn’t tell him.

I’m not really sure what to do now...my anxiety has gotten pretty bad with the state of the world (pandemic) and being stuck in the house, so he is treating that first which is definitely my priority as well. But with my new job, I feel as though I may need to fess up and be open minded to the possibility of trying a stimulant medication again. I feel stupid for it and .... yeah idk.

&lt;p&gt;So now I&amp;#39;ve lost all my motivation to try and socialise with people, I&amp;#39;ve grown to develop trust issues and depression. I also generally feel like I can&amp;#39;t develop relationships with people as I am always in my head, and also lack common interest 20 F, (cooking, watching shows, solo exercises).

432,,ADHD,"I'm relatively new to ADHD diagnosis and meds. Started with methylphenidate IR and didn't really like it, as the ratio of jittery side effects to focus benefits was too high. Tried adderall IR next, and it has been a much better fit. For whatever reason I don't feel as jittery and anxious as with the methylphenidate. 

I assumed that I would want to progress to the XR version once I settled on the right med, since I need coverage for my entire workdays. But I have started taking 4 divided doses of IR every couple hours, vs the two dose schedule recommended, and it has been working really well. I don't have the ups and downs during the day, it's more of a long peak before I drop off in the late afternoon as the workday is ending. 

So I had a thought that being on IR actually gives me the flexibility to have all day coverage, but also to start later or end earlier if I want to. Some days, especially weekends, I like to take a little break. But sometimes I just want to have a normal morning and then maybe be functional for home duties and obligations for the second half of the day. Or vice versa: get shit done in the morning and then be able to take a nap in the afternoon. I am definitely not one of those people that can nap on adderall. But If I only had XR in the late day scenario, I might be screwed because I definitely have trouble sleeping if I take IR after about 3pm. So if I took XR at 12pm I can imagine I would have trouble sleeping that night.

I got accepted into law school (YAY!) and will be starting in fall of 2021. I am super smart and have no doubt that I am intellectually up for the challenge, BUT attention problems unfortunately make reading long dense bodies of text a struggle and a half (I'm sure y'all relate).

I thought my current undergraduate degree had a lot of reading (\~60 pages per class per week) but when reading reddit posts from people currently attending my future law school, they claim that the amount of reading can get as high as \~200 pages per class per week!

Needless to say I'm kind of freaking out. It was already very tough getting my readings completed on time with 60 pages per class but 200??? My stomach is doing somersaults just thinking about it. I know lots of people are successful at law school with ADHD so evidently, it is possible to manage.

443,,ADHD,"hi! so basically, I'm ADD and in college right now, I took Fall semester off because of Covid and so I wasn't medicated then, I'm on adderall now. Before Covid I used to take vyvanse. I take it almost every day, (I need it every day, I just try to make it last because I get a dose lower than I need, wares off fast, doesn't work that well) and it works well enough that I can do pretty well academically. However. Socially/mentally I'm a MESS. I haven't felt this specific type of depression type apathy before from vyvanse (and I've also had generalized anxiety/depression before). I have no idea if this is a result of doing work 24/7 and just being mentally vacant, or if the meds off and on (and adderall itself) are really messing with my brain chemistry. I feel so off it's insane, and I really don't think it's an anxiety/depression relapse because I've worked through a lot of the trauma that caused those feelings. I'm almost like agoraphobic, I'm really awkward around people to the point where I avoid everyone and every little interaction, and I feel like I'm legit in space when I have conversations, go outside, do anything.

Before Covid I used to take vyvanse. I take it almost every day, (I need it every day, I just try to make it last because I get a dose lower than I need, wares off fast, doesn&amp;#39;t work that well) and it works well enough that I can do pretty well academically. However. Socially/mentally I&amp;#39;m a MESS. I haven&amp;#39;t felt this specific type of depression type apathy before from vyvanse (and I&amp;#39;ve also had generalized anxiety/depression before). I have no idea if this is a result of doing work 24/7 and just being mentally vacant, or if the meds off and on (and adderall itself) are really messing with my brain chemistry.

Now, if the rest of the house was so messy I’d have a melt down, but just the one room, my personal mess space, can be as horrid as I want and it doesn’t bother me. 

I’ve always got crap for that, but what bothers me is people (mostly family) pointing out my other behaviors that contrast so much with it. They tell me it makes no sense for me to act so different in similar subjects. 

For example, I can’t get water if the trash can has been opened within the last hour. Even if I’m *really* dehydrated, unless I get one of those plastic prepackaged water bottles, I won’t touch the water descender. I have gone days with no liquid because of this. As annoying as it is, if I break this routine it bugs the crap out of me and it’s all I ever think about for at least a week. Also,
When I put on shoes I have to wash my hands right away. Another example is that If my morning doesn’t go *exactly* as planned (just the first hour after I wake up, not that long) then I can’t do work that day because I focus on that moment so hard. Other then that I get too spaced out and can’t give my all, or I’ll just flat out forget about a deadline or important project. 

It’s all just so frustrating. All these weird things are controlling how I live. I was told yesterday, “Don’t let that one thing decide your day” and while they were trying to be helpful and reassuring, it frustrated me. Like, if I could do that don’t you think I’d have started long ago? I dunno what this rant was supposed to accomplish... but I’m just tired of living like this.

460,,ADHD,"We all have people in our lives that just don't get certain aspects of ADHD. I read somewhere once that ADHD brains are, fortunately, really good at coming up with metaphors! 

I wanted to share some of the ones I use a lot and hopefully hear some new ones from other ADHD brains!!

The ones I like using are:

---

**For Brain Fog**

It's like you're driving in the slow lane and you *want* to switch lanes, but all the oncoming cars are going too fast. 

Also you're trying to drive from the passengers seat, so you don't have much control of the wheel. 

Also the car radio is playing the *same damn song on repeat* (like, its always doing that, but its even louder rn for no reason). 

---

**For Time Blindness**

Yknow how some days feel like they went by faster or slower than others, and when you wake up each morning you have no way of knowing if its gonna be a fast or slow day beforehand? 

Now imagine instead of every *day* going unpredictably faster/slower, its every *15 minutes.* 

The last 15 minutes might've been faster or slower than the previous 15 minutes. And there's no way to predict the speed of the next 15 minutes. And sometimes it's not even 15 minutes! It could be every 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 4.25 minutes, theres no telling!!

---

**For Fidgeting**

I have lightning that's trapped in my body and it just HAS to be used in some way. It can't just sit there or I will die. 

(For Avatar the Last Airbender fans, explain that its like lightning bending! But bending = fidgeting) 

---

**For Procrastination** (this one's kinda long but it helped me explain it to an ADHD skeptic professor, so I'm very proud of it!!) 

Imagine you're in a hospital waiting room and you're waiting for your name to be called. You broke your back really badly to the point where it hurts to stand, so you sit down. 

Now imagine something happens where you need to stand up and leave, like a fire or something. But it hurts *so* badly to stand up that you just can't do it. 

Some people come to scream at you for staying seated, and you try to explain your problem, but they say 'that's no excuse, there's a fire burning down the building!' 

Finally when the flames touch your hand, you get yourself to stand up and you quickly try to make up for lost time by hobbling to the exit.

(Add on: Accountability helps a lot because it's like someone handing you a crutch or offering to help you escape instead of just screaming at you to get up)

461,,ADHD,"Its like when you are craving a specific food, but dont know what it is,and its 100 times worse. Kind of like all of my thoughts are scrambled and incomplete,im thinking too fast ,and im hyperfocusing on everything in existence and nothing. Im bored of everything and want to do everything, and i want to do nothing as well. It happens like every four months and it always takes a few minutes to a few hours to fix, and its never the same way to fix. Its like boredom so bad that its almost suffocating,its like im  understimulated and over stimulated at the sametime. But i dont wanna see a docter for this symptom becuase it cuases me to be super productive becuase i feel an intense need to be productive while its happening, but also having half an anxiety attack at the same time. The best way to describe it is like the most sane and productive form of insanity, and normally it lasts long enough to get stuff done before i find the specific thing that stops it. Normally its organizing something or building something, but its always different and specific. The easiest way to fix it was always organizing my video games and video game consoles becuase i had so many of both and i enjoyed them. It usually took about 2 hours of organizing them before it was perfect and the feeling went away. But i cant do any of the things that have fixed it in the past. I only have one console right now, no game cases to organize, no building supplies, and ive already tried all the other ways of getting ridd of it and none worked. Its a very uncomfortable feeling and its actually incredibly fun when i find the ""itch"" of what i needed to do for it to go away. Its sounds like ocd when i put it into words but its nothing like ocd, its like all my emotions and adhd symptoms are happening at once even if they conflict ending with uncomfortable  boredom.

466,,ADHD,"I realized while walking around with my friend the other day how when I am distracted I am almost totally unaware of my surroundings. When we were crossing the street I could see the cars but I was so distracted talking I couldn’t think clearly about when it was safe to go. When we were in a store I was stumbling all over the isles instead of just one side and couldn’t really comprehend the clothes.

SO. What's the point of this post? To complain about my generally great life? Well, I suppose so. I'm looking for tips/advice from those of you who can relate to the fragility of new success, especially how you cope with an incredible fear of failure, and how you kept your mental health in check.

477,,ADHD,"Hello everyone... I've posted here a few times in the past about my struggles.

Last week I had a consultation with a therapist who has ADHD herself, and helps a lot of people with ADHD... I told her about all of my struggles, about how I was growing up, in college, and now. She basically validated my suspicion that I might have ADHD. She said she obviously can't diagnose me herself, but said that when I was describing my struggles it sounded like I was describing her life. She basically said it sounds like I have ADHD without flat out telling me. I really felt heard and understood. She didn't doubt my experiences or make me feel bad.

So I have a psychiatrist appointment in a few days and it's all I can think about. I feel incapable of thinking about anything else at this point. I mean, it's hard to focus on regular days but this has just been consuming me. I want answers so badly. I'm so scared the psychiatrist won't take my seriously. I've never been to one before and I have NO idea what to expect. I've already filled out everything online, including an ADHD questionnaire.

Should I explicitly say I'm there because I think I have ADHD? My worry with this is I don't want them to think I'm there for the medication. I've always been super hesitant about medication in general, even though I know its helpful for a lot of people. I just want to understand myself you know? I've read some peoples experiences that you should just describe your experiences and symptoms instead of telling them you think you have something. What do you guys think?

Some days, I can sit down and read an entire book in one sitting while others I struggle to find the motivation to even open to the page I left off on (I particularly struggle with this in a literature class I am taking). I also still fidget quite a bit (not as much as I used to but it is still a struggle). In order to pay attention (such as in class), I have to be doing something else (such as playing a mobile game, doodling/drawing, picking at my skin, playing with my hair) in order to absorb anything. It’s really annoying because I’m constantly worried about getting in trouble for doing activities other than what I’m expected to be doing in class that allow me to focus. As I was recently diagnosed, my teachers are unaware that I struggle with ADHD and have to do stim to pay attention. 

What I am wondering is if I am struggling just because I’m having days where my symptoms are worse than others? Or do I need a higher dose?

483,,ADHD,"I have a phenomenon that I have affectionately termed my ""ADHD ghost"". Please allow me to introduce him and tell me what tricks yours plays on you.

This is an all too common example:

I will be in the kitchen, making the same damn supper I make every night, going through the same steps. Then I will look down and something is missing. Just vanished from the spot I left it in. Like my paring knife. 

Now, I know from experience, that I must have been day dreaming while chopping and went on auto-pilot but have zero recollection or usually even knowledge of what I was day dreaming about. I am only snapped out of my (hopefully) meaningful head dialogue when my routine is interrupted because I cannot continue without the missing item. 9 times out of 10, I put it away in the knife drawer or in my sink to wash--even though I'm not yet done with it. This is where I usually find it, but occasionally I must go into what another has endearingly termed a ""deep dive"". I so related to their experience, I needed to share my own.

Now, the deep dives, they suck. I feel like you KNOW what a deep dive entails although the term may be foreign. There is probably even a sense of dread washing over you now as you read this in empathy. 

I suggest you have multiple back ups of important items for instances when time does not permit a deep dive. Deep dives have no time frame, time does not seem to exist when the ADHD ghost hides something so well you need to tear your house apart. 

The time, space continuum just folds in upon itself at the sheer horror that an intelligent, adult human being could put a paring knife in her own sock drawer... at the very back, no less. Because OBVIOUSLY, one day, my pairing knife will prove handy at the back of my sock drawer, right? FUCK NO. In no parallel universe is this EVER right or wise! Why ADHD Ghost, just WHY?! But I digress... If a deep dive must be undertaken, it could take 30 seconds or 3 years, 2 months and 6 days to find the MIA item. 

You should NEVER look in the most logical place for vanishing items if you suspect your ADHD ghost has gone rogue. You should look in weird places, like inside your pickle jar, being used as a bookmark or, even buried in your potted plant. Cuz, who knows? ADHD ghost is a trickster. When you have ADHD, you cant trust your own memory and logic after all.

Ive shared all about my little ADHD ghoul with neurotypicals, wondering if this could be a shared, normal human experience. They look at me with shock, awe and concern that I may have brain damage. Many recall putting something like milk away when they are not yet done with it. But they vaguely RECALL it. Know they did it, just not sure why, as they were deep in thought. They also put it in a reasonable place, like the fridge. Me? Space cadetting so hard, I have no awareness of even having moved from the spot. I just look down, and the ADHD ghost stole my shit. Again.

Edit: this ghost is also an expert at making me late. I am usually running right on schedule when I realize my ADHD apparition has levitated my car keys into another dimension.

484,,ADHD,"I’m getting my PhD right now. This page has been so helpful already to know there are many people out there like me. But I’m still at such a loss about being able to function and get work done daily. 

My main questions for everyone are: 

How do people stick to a working/writing schedule every day? Especially now that many people work from home. 

Do your advisors (or boss) know you have ADHD? Will it help me if I’m transparent about my struggles? My advisors know I’ve been struggling with depression, but don’t know about my recent ADHD diagnosis. 

I’m working on my dissertation and currently on fellowship, which basically means I have no set work schedule and no where to be, ever. Especially since COVID. I was just diagnosed with ADHD less than a month ago, and now I understand more about myself. Having no schedule and no accountability structure beyond my advisors is just a recipe for unending procrastination and anxiety. I’ve tried writing groups, and it helps for about a week until I get so burnt out and sleep in a bunch, missing regular working hours. I signed up for a writing accountability online forum, and it worked for a few weeks. But when I tried the program again, it just deepened my anxiety and I avoided everything instead. Beyond trying to make accountability structures for myself stick, I’m also working hard in therapy to help with anxiety and impostor syndrome (have been for years now). I have a good psychiatrist who has thankfully spotted that I don’t just have depression and an anxiety disorder. So she has put me on antidepressants that have definitely helped because I went from not getting out of bed ever to being able to do the bare minimum most days of the week. She just had me figure out if Adderall or Ritalin is the way to go for me, so I’ve been trying to decide which works better. I think the Adderall helps more but I wonder if I need to up my prescription? Right now I’m on 20mg— is this a standard dose? 

My motivation levels vary depending on the day—some days I’m lucky I get out of bed. I try so hard to work but I feel like every time I start I get overwhelmed my the sheer amount I have to do, freak out, then calm down, then I’m exhausted and my brain is tired so I give up for the day. On a good day, I work for anywhere between one and three hours. On a bad day, I’m doing something to distract from the intense anxiety I feel about procrastinating (usually video games). This week has been particularly bad because my greatest accomplishment is that I made an actual human dinner for once. 

I feel so stuck. And I’m terrified I will never finish. I have a mandatory check in with my program and advisors— I have to show them what I’ve been working on by the end of the month. Only, I have almost nothing written to show them. I have some of the “thinking work” for part of my argument done but beyond that, no new pages to pass along.

Problem is, they only seem to last for about 5 hours before I crash HARD. I’ve been getting extremely fatigued and sad, and tonight I’ve been more depressed than I’ve felt in a long time—I just spent the past hour crying my eyes out for no reason.

492,,ADHD,"I'm nervous for a lot of reasons, but here's what's happened:

I'm not diagnosed ADHD but I strongly suspect it's there. My brother and mother are diagnosed. I'm 28 and have struggled with depression and fatigue my whole life. For the past year, I've gotten the depression under control to the best degree I ever have. It's great. 

Still, I am effectively useless when I need to focus on something. The weird thing is I'm not even able to force myself to stay focused on things I *want* to do, and I keep myself busy by doing all the little side tasks and browsing the internet instead of tackling my actual important tasks. It's to a degree where I don't feel like I'm at the wheel. 

So, I had my first psych meeting yesterday. 

She asks if I've ever been treated for mental illness before and I tell her about my depression and years of therapy. 

She kind of latches on to that and says I probably have some underlying depression that needs to be managed better. In the end she prescribes Wellbutrin. 

Now, she may be right. But the thing is, I feel better now, when it comes to depression, than I have in 10+ years. I basically feel like I'm out of the woods (even though it still comes and goes and will likely be with me to some degree my whole life). It just kind of feelings like...odd timing? Here I am doing better than ever, and *now* I'm going to start a serious medication for depression that sometimes has horrific side effects? I feel like my current issue is clearly focus, not depression.

I dono. Maybe it will be great and I just need to try it. I guess I'm worried about the risk/reward of tinkering with my brain at this point. Even though I feel better than ever, I could definitely improve a lot, so maybe it's worth it.

494,,ADHD,"I'm 32. Back in school, hopefully and finally finding something I wish I knew about 10 years ago. However, that's not the point of this post. The point is something that happened a week ago:

Like I stated, I'm back in school. Now, before I begin, I can probably state I could probably get through life without taking any medication. Would it be a challenge, sure; however, my Attention Deficit Disorder is not too server were I need medication on a daily basis but there are days it would be helpful while others I could go without.

Up until last week I haven't taken medication in about a year-and-a-half to two years. I'm consistently, inconsistent in not taking medication. Therefore, I was out and needed a refil. I work at hospital, and my hospital has a wellness.  If you don't know what a wellness center, its basis a clinic for employees, but with some restrictions, i.e. they can't prescribed Adderall.

I've used Adderall my entire diagnosis. For the last 12 years - theoretical I've had ADD my entire childhood but was never ""officially"" diagnosis, that's a different post for a different time. A different padora's box.

At this wellness center, in order for them to prescribe Adderall they need conformation from Psychiatrist once a year that they've prescribed Adderall to me. A little annoying but since I work in the health care field, I understand their reasoning. However, I've not seen my last Psychiatrist - been through 2 since I've started working at this hospital and using the wellness center in the last 5 years - since 2019.

I could go find a Primary Care Physician. I did, because that's alot easier. They can just prescribed it. However, that guy was asshole. Just did not care about me - another ran, another time. So, fuck him. He's not getting my insurance money. So, back to the wellness center.

Now - this is last Monday, the point of this post - I'm talking to the MA (Medcal Assistant) [she's basically wannabe Nurse. A step between Nurses Assistant and Nurse. Not alot places uses them] I'm telling her how I haven't taken medication in some time, being consistently, inconsistent, and basically needing it for schooling. I read one page, look at for 30 minutes and can't return for the rest of the week. I tell her I understand y'all can't prescribed Adderall at this time and I'm open to try something else until I can make an appointment - which I haven't yet - with my Psychiatrist.

After explaining this entire post to her, first thing she says: ***""So, why do you need medication?""***

After talking in circles for about 20 minutes, i was finally able to talk to the Nurse Practitioner (which is part of reasoning they can't prescribe Adderall directly) and she completely understood what was going on, understood my life and was more than willing to figure this out until I was able make an appointment with my Psychiatris.

So, rant: some people just don't get it.

499,,ADHD,"I never really believed my diagnosis of ADHD-pi. I suspected it, but the more I read about what people experience, the more I question if I'm actually ADHD-pi, because I don't think my symptoms match up the same way. I should also point out I've been told I suffer from General Anxiety Disorder as well. Nonetheless, here's my experience:

I suspected I might have ADHD-pi, because I would tell my doctor I always felt like I was living in a fog. I wasn't even sure if that was the right term, but that's what I'd call it. I always feel stuck in my head, both mentally and physically. Like there's a filter between my sense and it makes me almost unable to connect with the world. I know this sounds similar to DPDR, but I don't think that's it. I told my GP I wanted to get tested for ADHD-pi, and the psychologist diagnosed me with it. Again, not sure how confident I am in the diagnosis (self thoughts: ""Did I exaggerate how bad I experience some things, was my problems doing the evaluation tasks actually because of anxiety, or was it in fact ADHD-pi, etc."").

**Symptoms I experience:**

 - One thing I always noticed was how well people could get lost in doing things. A lot of times when I'd talk to people while they were texting, they would completely drown me out to the point where I had to repeat myself multiple times before it'd register to them enough to take their focus away. I always had the exact opposite. If I was texting, I couldn't get lost enough in it to drown out other people. I'd respond immediately. Was it because I was unable to focus enough on texting, that them asking me a question could simply pull my attention to them easily? Was it my anxiety telling me that it's rude to ignore someone talking, so I should make sure to answer immediately if someone asked a question even if I'm texting, which would cause me to make sure my attention was available even while trying to text? Probably the former, but I don't know. Anyways, that's one symptom

 - When talking to important people, like coworkers (I say important because you obviously have to be careful so you don't get fire), I would constantly be stuck in my head when conversing about work related topics. If I asked a question, while they were repsonding, I would be less focused on what they were actually saying, and more worried about if I was making a face that showed I was paying attention. Did I look like I knew what he was talking about? Did I look annoyed? Bored? Oh man, I don't understand any of this. Does he think I'm dumb? God I'm so dumb, why don't I understand any of this? Next thing you know he's done talking, and not a lot registered. Now this doesn't seem to be much of an issue when I am more confident and understand the material better, but the second I realize I don't understand something, negative self talk, doubt about myself, etc kicks in pretty bad. Is this a general anxiety thing, or an ADHD thing? I don't know.

 - I physcially feel stuck in my head. Like there's literally a filter between myself and the world. Makes it near impossible to actually connect to the outside worms. It's almost as if all my sense go through a filter in my head, and stop there, as opposed to my senses extending outside my head. I basically experience life inside my head. Not ""behind"" my head I don't think, but like there's a super, super thin sheet of glass directly in front of my eyes/senses that makes connecting to actual life just out reach. Really hard to explain, but this symptom alone causes a lot of problems. 

- Even if I actively try not to make a mistake, there will more than likely still be a mistake made somewhere

 - I have a hard time staying focused for a long time at work, especially when a problem comes up. If I know what In doing, and am confident I know what I'm doing, there's less anxiety. But the interesting this is, the more confident I feel in my ability to do a project, the more I procrastinate. ""Ah, I know I could easily do this, let's go do something else for a bit and then come back and finish this up quick at the end of the day"". Only problem is nothing ever goes as fast as I think it does. Therefore I end up procrastinating and cramming at the end. I don't think I ever did this with school work, I actually preferred to get homework out the way right away so I could spend my time playing videogames or whatever, but that mindset has changed now that I work.

- I have *zero* organizational skills. Literally zero. My brain legitamately cannot compute how to organize. Even if I tried I don't think I could do it. My workstation was always a complete mess when I was in the office. Even now at my work from home office, there's shit everywhere. If put something down, my brain will not register it, and I'll lose it

 • I basically have a hard time focusing on anything. I literally cannot zone out while doing something. Zoning out while doing something, to me, sounds like having such a strong focus on something, that you can't pay attention to anything else. I have the opposite problem. I seriously cannot focus in on anything. Not really even stuff I like.

 - I have constant negative self talk. I also have zero confidence in my abilities. Maybe a general anxiety thing, maybe an ADHD-pi thing. I don't know.

 - I overthink things, a lot. At my old job I would ask questions about work that he would go, ""Man, you ask questions I don't think even think of. I've never thought that deep about it."" He never said it in a rude way, but it made me realize how much I over think things, and I think this is a symptom of trying to compensate for a lack of understanding things. I try to understand everything about a given topic, so that I can understand the overall topic it at a basic level. Which leads me to my next symptom

 - I have to ask a lot of questions in order to understand something deeply, otherwise I won't truly understand it. I school, I would ask questions non-stop (either to the teacher, or in my head if I didn't want to hold the class up) because if I didn't understanding something at a fundamental level, then I knew I just couldn't grasp the concept. An example would be I felt I couldn't truly grasp electricity (in order to be a successful electrician) unless I understand electricity down to the level of what quarks are and how they work. I would try to understand every single aspect of something's just to understand it at a level most others could. Even then I couldn't grasp it. I feel like a jack of all trades with knowledge. I understand a decent amount of everything, but not a whole lot of anything. I have basically factoids and fragments of knowledge, but it never becomes a cohesive understanding of anything in whole

 - My mind feels blank all the time. I often hear of ADHD people having too much ""background sound"" in their head, like random bits of music, daydreaming, etc. Going on, but I always felt the exact opposite problem. It's like my mind is blank. Just crickets. It makes it hard to form complete thoughts, and it's why I'm an awful teacher (also because again, I don't understand anything at a deep enough level). It's like the gears in my head turn slowly than most people. I'm not dumb by any means either, but it's hard to explain. My mind is just more blank and less busy than other ADHD people, and even normal people, it seems. Hence why it's hard for me to grape things, I assume.

This is all I can think of right now. I'll add more as I think of them

502,,ADHD,"Warning: long post! 

Thank you in advance for always being so supportive and helpful in this community! 

My first dose was 27 mg of Concerta and the first 2 days were overwhelming emotionally. I felt so calm, less anxious and my brain was less foggy and more quiet. I cried because I felt hope again in my life and that I could see a better future for me. After 4 weeks, my dose was increased to 37mg and there was no difference. Question here: will another increase make a difference or should 37 mg or less be enough? Was the increase to small? Or will Adderall work better? What is your experience?

Reason why I am asking is because I feel like I am only receiving 40-50% of the benefits. I still feel spaced out on my meds, but not as much as I used to. Sometimes I feel like my brain is overpowering the medication which makes me question the severity of my ADHD. I am still in the early phases, but any shared experiences can help me better understand the effects of the medication and my situation. 

Side note 1: I am not seeking that high I got the first 2 days. Not trying to go down the path of substance abuse! Just trying to find the right dose and type that will give the most benefit longterm. 

Side note 2: I am also suffering from depression which is important to factor in. I believe my depression stems from family problems and not triggered by my ADHD. This leads me to think that I can't get the max benefits from the medication. Is anyone taking ADHD meds and antidepressants simultaneously?

522,,ADHD,"Hi all.

Tl;dr : my GP sent me a questionnaire to assess herself if I have ADHD or not. I thought I needed to see a neurologist or psychiatrist for that evaluation. Is it okay to do this with the GP ?

---
I've just discovered this sub a week ago and reading all your posts made me decide to finally take the step towards making an appointment for an ADHD evaluation since so many of your stories resonated in a way I couldn't believe possible.

I've been thinking about this for a long time now, almost a year, from dismissing the idea to accepting the possibility. I've called to grab some information about the process in a ADHD clinic. At first the price made me think about it twice (as it was around 1500$) but I've been told it was expensive anyway so I took the time to make peace with it before calling my GP to get a prescription in order to make an appointment to the ADHD clinic.

When I was on the phone with the GP, she asked me why I wanted to get an evaluation and asked me about my symptoms. Then she told me I didn't need to go see a neurologist or a psychiatrist for the evaluation in a clinic, that she will send me a self-report questionnaire to fill in by mail to send her back so she could start the medication based on my answers.

When I asked her if it was usual, she said that, given my symptoms, I was an ""obvious"" case and that people going to see the neurologist for an evaluation was more because it was harder to diagnose them.

I am in Canada. The file she sent me is from the Canadian ADHD Ressources Alliance and have all the questions you can find on the DSM-V for the self-report ADHD evaluation.

Yet, I am confused, I was under the impression that only a psychiatrist or neurologist could assess and give an official (recognized) diagnosis after several appointments, including one with your family.

Can my GP properly assess my symptoms just over a PDF file ?
Whatever the conclusion she reaches, will it be officially recognized ?
Why would she ask to do this that way ?

Don't get me wrong, I am more than ok with it not costing me 1500$, but I want to be sure to have someone skilled enough in this area and also, I really want answers for once.",t2_nac48,False,,0,False,Can your General Practitioner assess your ADHD diagnosis ?

Then she told me I didn&amp;#39;t need to go see a neurologist or a psychiatrist for the evaluation in a clinic, that she will send me a self-report questionnaire to fill in by mail to send her back so she could start the medication based on my answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I asked her if it was usual, she said that, given my symptoms, I was an &amp;quot;obvious&amp;quot; case and that people going to see the neurologist for an evaluation was more because it was harder to diagnose them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am in Canada. The file she sent me is from the Canadian ADHD Ressources Alliance and have all the questions you can find on the DSM-V for the self-report ADHD evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, I am confused, I was under the impression that only a psychiatrist or neurologist could assess and give an official (recognized) diagnosis after several appointments, including one with your family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can my GP properly assess my symptoms just over a PDF file ?
Whatever the conclusion she reaches, will it be officially recognized ?
Why would she ask to do this that way ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I am more than ok with it not costing me 1500$, but I want to be sure to have someone skilled enough in this area and also, I really want answers for once.&lt;/p&gt;

525,,ADHD,"Hey /r/ADHD

I got my diagnosis a few weeks back, which is awesome as it means I got access to prescription Elvanse to help me with focus. My job is pretty intense in organisation skills and time management, so meds seems like a good idea to help me with this just when I know I'm going to have a long day. The plan is to not take my meds unless I have to if possible.

I took my first Elvanse 30mg yesterday and for 3 or 4 hours I felt uber productive and like I coukd take on the world. Then all of a sudden it started to wear off, and all my symptoms started to creep back in. By 5pm I was a potato and felt the need to go to bed. By 9pm I was a mess, on the brink of vomiting, sensitive to light, throbbing headache and super crazy dizzy. One of the worst experiences I've ever had.

I got to sleep relatively easy at around midnight, but then waking up this morning I still felt incredibly dizzy and still had the throbbing headache. It's almost 3pm and I'm still feeling like this. I've eaten food and drunk a solid litre and a half of water and I'm still not getting better.

527,,ADHD,"This is the first post I have ever made on reddit.  I have not been diagnosed with ADHD since my parents did not believe in psychology growing up and had a general distrust for it.  I have just begun seeing a psychologist for depression and ADHD issues that have been having a very negative effect on my life for a very long time.  For the record,  I have been having pretty severe ADHD symptoms as long as I can remember.  I have always *hated* doing homework, and when I say hated, I mean it was mentally painful.  This was not because I was not capable of doing it, but because of the extended mental effort it took to complete it.  Besides that, I simply had no interest in it.  I spent most of my childhood outside, adventuring in the woods, playing with my dog and shooting BB guns.  Onto the topic of this post, I have always had extreme difficulty in containing my impulses.  If I had the impulse to say something mean to someone because I was very angry, I did it.  I felt bad about it after, but I could not stop myself from doing it.  This alienated me from my peers and teachers because I thought they saw me as someone who was destructive, uncontrollable, unpredictable and perhaps even dangerous.  It was not that I was not kind, I was, but I was always the one who was constantly disrupting classes, breaking the rules and doing things that the teachers did not want me to be doing.  I wanted to pay attention in class, and believe me my parents tried as hard as they could to get that message through my head, but I just couldn't.  I would lose half of my assignments, half-finish the rest, and forget that papers were due constantly.  I constantly misplace everything, and constantly forget appointments to my utter dismay.  I feel shameful for missing my appointments because I really care about my teachers and I don't want them to feel that I don't care but I literally cannot remember them.  As this has gone on my whole life, and because I am only now receiving counseling support, my whole life I have had a pretty deep belief that there is simply something wrong with me.  That I am somehow morally defective because I cannot do what everybody else can seemingly so easily.  Every time I say I'm not going to do something that I know is not in my best interest, I do it anyways, because in the moment, it feels good.  It's very very very difficult to stop myself from doing things I know are harmful to me in the long run, but feel great in the short term.  This applies to everything from promiscuous sex to using drugs and vaping.  Adding to that my Christian background, and the fact that I feel I should be able to control my temptations to do risky things: use drugs, vape, have a lot of sex with different people, speed and drive dangerously.  It all around makes me feel kind of worthless that I have so little ability to control myself and my actions.  It also kind of alienates me from other people because it seems so easy for other people in comparison to myself.  I was just feeling depressed tonight and I wanted to vent here.

531,,ADHD,"I'm in my mid-20s. Back in the late 2000s when I was in HS, FB has just become famous and smartphones weren't as famous (at least not in my school). 

For half of my HS years we didn't have internet at home. Even though we could easily afford it, I don't remember why. 

But what I do remember was that I could stack up my notebooks and books and hyperfocus for hours on end studying for exams. I went from one of the academically lowest in our HS batch to graduating at top 3 of our batch and was awarded best in Mathematics - Calculus and Trigonometry. 

In 2011, when social media and smartphones became more popular is when the ADHD recklessness and procrastination reared its ugly head. I was in a college dorm with no parents to police me and all the internet, booze, junk foods, and booze at my disposal.

I just couldn't sit still and study straight like I did in HS. That's when my sleep problems started too. Back in HS I would sleep at 9pm now I fall asleep at around 4am.

And also, many people (non-ADHDers) can function quite well despite all these tech.

Sometimes I start to question and doubt if I do have ADHD and it's just the social media, internet, and smartphones?

I mean, my mom and cousins seem to have it and I did show symptoms even in early childhood (impatient, impulsive, seems less mature than kids my age, overly talkative, etc.).  I've been to the best psychiatrists in my country and all unanimously agree that I have ADHD and was diagnosed at 20 yo.

I feel like the doubts I'm having about my ADHD (despite the signs) are just a subconscious way of coping, so I'd like to get your thoughts.

543,,ADHD,"For years, me and my mom have been adamant that I have ADHD. Maybe ASD, but mainly ADHD. I was born female, which never turns out well in the mental health field.

I’m not looking for a diagnosis on here, of course. I’m just so, so frustrated. Just some support or something, maybe someone who can relate. 

I haven’t been diagnosed, at nearly 20 years old. I’ve been tested at least 4 times. In this paperwork from when I was 8, they talk about how I fit perfectly with ADHD and how I need all these classroom accommodations, hell I still do. But yet... they never made it official. Later professionals continued to insist to my mother because I couldn’t handle stimulants I couldn’t be, which is just ridiculous. Professionals in my teens just told me they didn’t know, or slapped me with the most universal diagnosis they could- bipolar.

In this paperwork from when I was 8, they talk about how I fit perfectly with ADHD and how I need all these classroom accommodations, hell I still do. But yet... they never made it official. Later professionals continued to insist to my mother because I couldn’t handle stimulants I couldn’t be, which is just ridiculous. Professionals in my teens just told me they didn’t know, or slapped me with the most universal diagnosis they could- bipolar.

555,,ADHD,"Okay so, I think I have ADHD (inattentive mostly) and I finally made the jump and talked to my doctor about a referral to a clinic (hurray!). I'm on a waitlist now, which is fine, I was already anticipating a long wait. For better or worse I work for myself so I at least don't have a boss breathing down my neck on bad days. But in the meantime I've been thinking about what I'm going to tell the docs at the clinic and although I have a list a mile long for my symptoms as an adult, I've got basically nothing for when I was a kid, and I know there's gonna be a lot of emphasis on that when I get an appointment.

Most of the problem is that I simply can't remember, but when I look at specifics, I don't feel like I had many of those issues, at least not until middle school.

Sometimes it did help me focus a lot better, and other times it felt kind of useless. My comedowns were also horrible, with extreme anxiety and inability to sleep when the drug started to wear off.

Obviously it's only been a couple days on concerta, but I'm not sure what to be expecting.

The weird thing is that I have been taking the same amount of Concerta (36mg) and I experienced both (passing-out and quasi-insomnia). I'm not sure if it's because of Concerta or other extra medications. The only differences are the amount of alprazolam, fluoxetine and aripiprazole.

 I'll talk to psychiatrist about this on next appointment.

Any advice on how to manage the stress and get shit caught up at work without working a shit ton of overtime (which I don’t get paid for because I’m salaried) would be greatly appreciated.**

THE LONGER AND MORE DETAILED STORY:

I work at a financial start-up and have been at my job for several years. I am the only employee that has been with the company since the very beginning. In addition to working with clients, I also help answer phones, deal with all outgoing mail and a variety of other admin tasks.

So I was burned out at my job and thinking of looking for a new position even prior to COVID. Then when the pandemic hit, I fell hard from the top of the depression tree and hit every branch down. I am the caretaker for a parent with stage 4 lung cancer, didn’t want to learn a new job remotely or worse, be forced to work outside the home, so I stayed put. 

Well, the burnout got much worse. Had a productive period around summertime, got diagnosed with my ADHD in August and got treatment for the first time, hit another depression lull in October and it’s been rough ever since. Since then, it has been a battle and a half to get motivated enough to do ANYTHING and I am falling further and further behind. My boss hired help to start at the beginning of the year to assist me and she was terrible and also ended up quitting a few weeks ago and between having to train her and also correct the plethora of mistakes she made, she ended up taking up more of my time and putting me even more behind than I was to start with.

I end every single day feeling more behind than I started. Every time I try to put in significant time to getting my inbox caught up, I end up getting so many emails during the day that it negates any progress I have made. It feels every day is another iteration of “what did I do wrong/what did I miss/what did I forget”  and I never feel like I’ve accomplished anything, even when I’ve had a busy and productive day. It is  EXHAUSTING feeling like I can’t do anything right 24/7.

At this rate, the stress is really wearing on me physically. I’m perpetually fatigued, I’ve had multiple panic attacks over the last several months, I cry pretty much on a daily basis and last week, I got stress hives for the first time ever. I know the obvious answer here is to find a new job and I’m looking but having a hard time finding anything that I’m interested in, qualified for and/or that does not want to pay me an insultingly low salary (I’m willing to trade a pay cut for my mental health to some degree but I have bills to pay and a sick parent to take care of so I can’t just accept anything).

I just feel so discouraged and hopeless. I don’t know how to get my stress to a manageable level. Getting through the work week feels like it’s an insane challenge that I don’t know how to get through anymore. I used to be a total machine and now every email I get sends me into a down spiral again.

566,,ADHD,"I've recently found out I probably have ADHD. It answers a lot of questions I've had for a long time, and I've also realized just how much I hold back in telling people what I've screwed up or forgotten. I've started telling my parents more of just the day to day mess ups and they're a little taken aback, because they've gotten used to a different version of me.

I've been in therapy for a while because I have other issues. I developed an alcohol addiction a few years ago. I stopped drinking but my anxiety and depression remained pretty bad. I have found some tools that have helped me a lot, such as reframing and positive affirmations. I take medication. I still struggle with things I know will really help, like eating healthily, exercising regularly, and meditating regularly.

There's something I still have not figured out. I'm a grad student and I have an exam I need to study for that includes a presentation in two months. I felt like I was running out of time weeks ago. I just. can't. study. I set time in the calendar on Friday to study and in the morning was pumped to do it. But by the end of the day I knew it wasn't going to happen, because the whole day went well except for one short meeting where afterward I felt so stupid that it affected me until the middle of the next day. I set time in the calendar again for Monday and it's passed and I didn't start.

It feels like such a bad, terrible idea to start. Like I'll somehow make things worse if I start. It sounds ridiculous explaining it. But when I have managed to get myself to do it over the past few weeks, I can barely make it through one page of a textbook. Like my emotions are so high and so tied to this that I can't process more than 5 paragraphs a day.

If anyone has had experience with this, what have you done to deal with the extremely strong emotions in the moment? In the past, I drank to calm the emotions. This was a very bad idea, because I didn't focus too well when I was drinking either. I have trouble thinking over my emotions, I have trouble countering them because I still don't know exactly what it is that I'm afraid of.

575,,ADHD,"I just wanted to share.

My assessment lasted an entire day (9:30-5:00) and I even had to go back for another couple of hours of testing. The psychologist wanted to do an educational assessment in order to make recommendations to the school for accommodations which is why it took so long. 

However, now I'm worried that I did too well on some of the tests and she's going to say I don't have ADHD, it's just depression or something. 

I'm not sure how an assessment is supposed to go but it seemed we focused more on academics, and listening, and remembering tasks than anything else. We did have an ""interview"" session, but I never got to mention how it's affected all aspects of my life, my rejection sensitivity, body-focused repetitive behaviours, or family history with mental health. 

I did fill out a form that asked a bit about family history, but we didn't really discuss it. I guess I should be glad my mother kept all of my report cards, so hopefully, they will help. 

Maybe I'm just overthinking it or being pessimistic. Either way, I have to wait 2.5 weeks to get my results back.

&lt;p&gt;My assessment lasted an entire day (9:30-5:00) and I even had to go back for another couple of hours of testing. The psychologist wanted to do an educational assessment in order to make recommendations to the school for accommodations which is why it took so long. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, now I&amp;#39;m worried that I did too well on some of the tests and she&amp;#39;s going to say I don&amp;#39;t have ADHD, it&amp;#39;s just depression or something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not sure how an assessment is supposed to go but it seemed we focused more on academics, and listening, and remembering tasks than anything else. We did have an &amp;quot;interview&amp;quot; session, but I never got to mention how it&amp;#39;s affected all aspects of my life, my rejection sensitivity, body-focused repetitive behaviours, or family history with mental health. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did fill out a form that asked a bit about family history, but we didn&amp;#39;t really discuss it. I guess I should be glad my mother kept all of my report cards, so hopefully, they will help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&amp;#39;m just overthinking it or being pessimistic. Either way, I have to wait 2.5 weeks to get my results back. &lt;/p&gt;

578,,ADHD,"I'm really sorry this is so long, there is a tl;dr at the end. 

Hi, so I'm 16 and in March 2020 I got my learner's permit. 

In August 2020 I got into a car accident. I was in the left turning lane on a big intersection and I was getting ready to turn left. All I remember is seeing the car turning right in front of me and my stepmother yelling stop then the airbags going off. 

All that happened was that I ran through a red light turning left and hit the car turning right in the lane across from me in the intersection. I don't purposefully run red lights, I especially don't drive recklessly as my family has gotten into many accidents before. 

It felt like my mind had gone on autopilot. I stopped thinking, I stopped registering that I was driving a car, It was like I blacked out. I saw the light turn yellow then red but I didn't register that it happened. Right before I hit the car my stepmom yelled at me to stop and I was suddenly thinking and able to register what was happening but at that point, it was too late and I couldn't avoid hitting them. Since I was turning left, I continued turning without realizing it and hit the car in the left turning lane on the road I was turning onto, if that makes sense. I completely totaled two cars and hit a third. 

I would rather not go into what I was experiencing when everything stopped because it's still really traumatizing and it still gives me really bad anxiety just thinking about it.

Thankfully, nobody got seriously hurt. The woman I hit first had a few small cuts on her arm and everyone else was okay. The cops, an ambulance, and a tow truck came and everything got sorted out. 

In October 2020, my mom took me to a psychiatrist and I got diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and ADHD, and have been on varying quantities of Adderall and Prozac since.

Now, 8 months later, I still haven't been behind the wheel of a car. Even being a passenger in cars with drivers who have had years of experience still gives me bad anxiety. My mom once ran through a yellow light in the same intersection and I had an intense panic attack; She pulled over and I sat in the back seat barely able to breathe or even think. 

The problem is, I'm getting a job soon and I have tons of extracurriculars that I need to be able to drive to and from. I want to start driving again but I'm still so afraid that I'll completely blank out while I'm driving again.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I get over it? How do I prevent blanking again like that? Has this happened to anyone else?

586,,ADHD,"Basically what happened was we were coming home from a vacation, and traditionally my mom always gets home mad from vacations, finding anything to tick her off. This was about a few months ago.

This time, my dad who was driving the car was supposed to make a stop at someones house before we got home. My mom, somehow only noticing my dad was pulling into the driveway decided to say “YOU FORGOT TO GO TO THEIR HOUSE.”

And I immediately said “WHY ARE YOU YELLING WE CAN JUST GO RIGHT NOW.” 

This escalated into a huge shouting match.

Now I’m not sure what ADHD has to do with it but when we were arguing she kept bringing up how I always get involved in my parents fights and that When I was driving the car early(before she made me switch with my dad) I wasnt focused and almost got into an accident(which was why she was already ticked off)

And then I was like, YOU KNOW MAYBE IF YOU ACTUALLY LET ME GET TREATED FOR MY ADHD WE WOULDNT HAVE THIS ISSUE.

She immediately turned silent. She went to her room and the next morning she apologized to me. When I was in high school, we saw a psychiatrist because I started failing classes when I was historically a low A student. I got prescribed anti depressants and stimulants but my mom said absolutely no to filling the prescription. As an Asian shes always had the mentality that its all in your head and that as Asians our genes are superior and that wouldn’t happen. 

I spent the next 2 years trying to find psychiatrists myself and I finally found one i think exactly a year ago today. Without telling her, I got treated got therapy, improved myself and got my grades and work ethic up.

So what happened since I told her? My parents decided to go to a Psychologist to get couples counseling. My dad realized he had adhd-i, and my mom has symptoms of hyperactivity, and anxiety. Their relationship after weeks of reflection finally got better.

Since then as a family we became more open to the topic of mental health struggles. I was finally able to open up about my mental health without them saying its just in your head. My mom finally talked about her abandonment issues and her chronic anxiety. My dad knows about his adhd but given his age and worklife he has nothing to treat really.

We’ve never had a perfect family life but we are now more open than ever. My mom always had the narrative that she wants to retire from
Her middle school teaching job(which pays her 6 figs) once I graduate. After more discussion, she moved it to “when I find a stable job.” You don’t understand the amount of pressure that relieves from me. Trust me I know i am capable of making 6 figs but I honestly can’t deal with the pressure of having such limited time, especially due to the pandemic. I still want to get my doctorate before I enter the workforce.

What is the lesson here? Well, I just wanted to point that maybe a discussion about mental health within your family doesn’t have to cause trouble. I know you would have anxiety if you did, but if you are able to approach it from a standpoint where you are able to describe your experiences, why they scientifically happen and why its not in your head, and even talk about your parents mental health, then you may reach a point where the discussion can be healthy. I’d like to note that my mom is a science teacher with a masters in special ed while my dad is also a firm believer of science. Despite that we are a very Catholic family and I think it was also helpful to use the fact that we believe we are made perfectly in the eyes of our creator despite our mental struggles.

I am very privileged to have a family that grew to finally accept my mental health struggles. I know others may not be as lucky, but my message is that it’s definitely not impossible.

589,,ADHD,"After watching a video from How to ADHD about bullet journaling, I decided to give it a shot.  I assumed it would be like every notebook or planner I've ever owned where I assumed it'd be the change in my life that would essentially eliminate all my ADHD challenges, but then I give up on it in a couple weeks.  Surprisingly, I am still using it 2 months later.  

If I ever fill this one up and get a new one, I'll make some changes, as there are parts I rarely use.  I never use the key, and the Future Log and monthly calendar seem redundant.  But these are the things I love about it: 

* I can use it in whatever disorganized, creative, fun manner I see fit.  If I feel like drawing on one of the pages, that's exactly what I'll do.  If I feel like adding a section for Book Bingo in the middle of the notebook I can.  
* I can use it for multiple purposes. Specifically, things that I need help with.  For instance, I have a section for ""important phone calls you need to make, Movies I want to watch, Books I want to read, and most importantly, I put in my daily ""to-dos.""  The daily ""to-dos"" are messy and spaced out where I decide to put them, but they are a life saver, since I thrive on physical check lists.
* I was able to pick out a super cute one that makes me happy each time I hold it. 
* I bought adorable planner stickers at the Dollar Tree that make me feel excited every time I put one in.
* I don't have to feel guilty if I don't use it every day. 
* I can color in the journal whenever I feel like it.
* I can use cheap Dollar Tree tabs to mark the important pages I want to quickly go back to.

590,,ADHD,"I just watched a video of a neurotypical taking a negative stance against stim meds for ADHD because of their own experience with addiction to them. One main point made during the video is that ""They're giving meth to little kids!"" which really got me thinking. We all know the way ADHD meds are treated is wack. Someone wouldn't freak out and say ""They're giving methylxanthine (caffeine stimulant class) to little kids!"" It's just a can of coke. The thing that makes a molecule a drug is its effect on humans, not something inherent about the structure of the compound itself. I think it's hard for nt ppl (and ADHD ppl through external reinforcement) to disconnect the molecule's inherent structure or name from the effects it has on (most) humans. No matter how well it's communicated that ""It doesn't get ADHD people high,"" it's still MeTh (I know that Adderall and Vyvanse aren't technically ""meth,"" but the primary difference is the absorption rate, having very similar effects on nt ppl at equivalent doses). If everybody (or the majority of people) reacted to stimulants the way that most ADHD people do, stims probably wouldn't even be regulated, or they would be regulated on the same level as ""acceptable drugs"" like alcohol and nicotine (that's a rant for another day). Imagine walking into a coffee shop and getting a Methylphenidate muffin or Amphetamine gummy bears. To (most) ADHD people, meds are no more abusable than caffeine is (which certainly isn't zero risks, but you can't deny how incredibly different they're treated). Nobody wants to feel like a robot from taking too high a dose, in the same way that nobody wants to experience caffeine jitters. I still feel some imposter-syndrome and external judgment related guilt taking my Adderall IR any more than once every other day, even though it really helps me. I really wish that I could take my meds and it not be treated any differently than my friends' morning coffee.

To (most) ADHD people, meds are no more abusable than caffeine is (which certainly isn&amp;#39;t zero risks, but you can&amp;#39;t deny how incredibly different they&amp;#39;re treated). Nobody wants to feel like a robot from taking too high a dose, in the same way that nobody wants to experience caffeine jitters. I still feel some imposter-syndrome and external judgment related guilt taking my Adderall IR any more than once every other day, even though it really helps me. I really wish that I could take my meds and it not be treated any differently than my friends&amp;#39; morning coffee. I&amp;#39;m lucky enough that my parents don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m an addict, but my dad still gives me shit saying &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t want you to become dependent. You worked fine without meds for years.&amp;quot; I know you aren&amp;#39;t talking mister 6 shots of espresso a day. Who&amp;#39;s really the dependant one here?&lt;/p&gt;

591,,ADHD,"I lost my job last month. They felt I was “behind” from what they expected from me, although I excelled in the beginning. I was angry that I was never made aware of my work or issues they had with me, and I felt led on by myself- where I thought I stood. It was a surprise to me and I enjoyed my job and most of my coworkers- as much as I hate “work”. 

Since then I’ve been thinking more of my issues and I suppose it makes sense that I seem like someone who just doesn’t get it. I went to school and I have trouble accessing the knowledge I paid for. I get caught off guard by questions I should know the answer to. I hear someone talking but I’m not really there- I’m thinking of something else I need to do but I look like I’m listening- you’d never know I’m not. I constantly check in to make sure I’m making the right choice and won’t make anyone mad if I do a thing. 

Then other than work theres the emotional disregulation, hyperfixation, needing to do 100 things so I do nothing at all, my mind constantly screaming at me to move and do things but I just scroll on the web for 3 hours straight. I’ve been a echo chamber for myself being “lazy”, but I want to do so much I just find it hard to make the first step. 

My GP diagnosed me with ADHD when I was in my late teens, but everyone thought that was silly- I’m not hyper I’m depressed! I bought it and never took the medication. I wanted to not be depressed and anxious, so we dealt with that. The last few years I have changed. The depression is not depression as I remember it, and it’s hardly even there. I’ll be depressed now and again for short periods but it’s not the same. I have spent this time trying to explain how I feel to doctors, but they tell me to just take the medication- otherwise what else can they do. I’ve never felt that medication worked for me, and no matter how many times I explained it, I was just put on a different one. Now I refuse, and have been refusing. Doctors hardly take me seriously- and then I think to myself “how do I come across?”. Scatterbrained and scared, unable to explain and describe or remember... I’m a mess. I’m working against myself. 

Learning more about ADHD I’ve learned that I identify completely, and I decided that’s my goal. I explained to my new doctor and he’s making me get a work up by a professional in that area- it’s been 2 months and I haven’t heard from the referral. Since then I have lost my job. I am struggling more and more to keep up with basic chores and I really don’t know why. Sometimes I don’t even go for a shower for days because I just don’t want to- I have more enjoyable things to do. I can’t sleep because I feel like I’m missing out on time- I hardly even feel tired. When I do try to sleep my mind is RACING- either plans or scenarios. Sometimes I won’t eat when I’m hungry because I don’t wanna stand there and cook it- sometimes I won’t eat because I’m so engrossed in what I’m doing that it never crosses my mind. My good habits are continuing to be terrible because I can’t control myself around the good sugary stuff- I’m screaming in my head to make better choices and that I don’t need something as I’m eating it. 

I feel so out of control. I’m full of frustration and anger. I just want it to stop. Why can’t I just do the things? I plan so hard.

592,,ADHD,"Im not entirely sure how to describe it, and I am honestly not sure if this is an ADHD problem or a depression problem, I have both and I find it hard to differentiate the source of the motivational struggles that can come with both but.. 

Does anyone find that they fall into these.. periods where nothing Hits Right? Like the space inbetween a new hobby or interest where you have several things you can do, several things you should do, but nothing itches that scratch?

I got back into World of Warcraft at the beginning of the new expansion. I got super duper into it, I convinced people to join again, or try it for the first time and it was super fun for a few weeks, really disruptive of my studies lmao but I enjoyed myself. And then one day my brain decided that this isnt fun anymore, this is the most boring thing ever and you're done with it.

I assume you're all familiar with this feeling, heh.

And sometimes this happens because you find something new and shiny and interesting right, jumping from hobby to hobby, I usually do that at least, but sometimes...

Man sometimes you lose interest in one thing without a new thing to focus on and it is the worst. I have so much energy I want to spend on something and I am literally surrounded by stuff I can do, my apartment is filled with stuff to play with but the moment I pick anything up I loose momentum because its Not The Right Thing apparently. 

I've reached that point of boredom where it feels like it physically hurts my brain in some weird way.

596,,ADHD,"I'm always mimicking the personality's around me, ya know? Playing a character per say, and its been great in a lot of cases but lately I've realized the new friends I made before the pandemic were ""bad influence's"" but the rona separated us so that's ok I guess, but I think I need to figure something else out.

I don't know how I really feel about anything. I'm very open minded and I tend to accept opinions of all sides, except for cases where I'm super opinionated for **no reason(adhd)** and I can say that because I generally don't hold the same beliefs the next day. I can usually reason both sides in my head is what I'm trying to say.

on the other hand what I might consider the real me is something I cant be. (there might be some undiagnosed problems or could be a part of adhd or even a normal human thing *I don't know*) but I've never really felt for other people, and I think selfishly, I believe that also stems from my core nihilistic beliefs, so kind of selfish in the way of ""what's the point of living if I'm not living for myself"".

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how I really feel about anything. I&amp;#39;m very open minded and I tend to accept opinions of all sides, except for cases where I&amp;#39;m super opinionated for &lt;strong&gt;no reason(adhd)&lt;/strong&gt; and I can say that because I generally don&amp;#39;t hold the same beliefs the next day. I can usually reason both sides in my head is what I&amp;#39;m trying to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on the other hand what I might consider the real me is something I cant be. (there might be some undiagnosed problems or could be a part of adhd or even a normal human thing &lt;em&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know&lt;/em&gt;) but I&amp;#39;ve never really felt for other people, and I think selfishly, I believe that also stems from my core nihilistic beliefs, so kind of selfish in the way of &amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s the point of living if I&amp;#39;m not living for myself&amp;quot;.

598,,ADHD,"I was so shocked and in awe at how much my highly specific shitpost ""ADHD is..."" resonated with so *many* people. I had so many people reach out to say that they were in tears because they realised that they aren't actually alone in ways they thought no one else could ever relate to.

I'm so glad that in sharing the truth about how people with ADHD actually live day-to-day, we can set each other free of how ashamed we feel about it... how entirely personal to us those struggles feel, and our need to hide/minimise them out of embarrassment.

However, I wrote the post to be a kind of in-joke and a knowing hug rather than a diagnostic tool for those who are questioning - it really is a pinch of salt sort of post. I say this because I had a lot of comments like ""now I know I definitely have ADHD"", which was making me feel a bit unnerved? I'm not qualified to tell anyone whether those behaviours/experiences definitely arise from a developmental disorder. The post doesn't define ADHD in the literal sense, but is more of a ""hey, I experience these things, and I put it down to my own ADHD"". It even spirals into the absurd, which I felt was a way of showing how I can barely define where my ADHD ""ends"" and I ""begin"", and how my ADHD symptom-spotting can become a hyper focus for me.

But if the post resonated with you, and gave you clarity on your behaviours and how you experience yourself, then that's valid in its own right - and if you want to see a psych to get a personalised assessment, absolutely by all means you should definitely do that! But please keep in mind that my post had no basis within science or psychology, and was devised from my personal experience rather than the DSM-V criteria. I really have no idea how much of what I said was about being ADHD or just being... a person?

606,,ADHD,"Here's a bunch of things I have used throughout my 4 years at university that have helped me. I only got diagnosed last week and cannot say for sure that these will help everybody but thought I would put them here for anyone that could use a bit of help! 

**Chrome extensions:**

* Weava Highlighter - lets you highlight pretty much anything and it stays if you exit the page and go back on it. I find this really useful when I know my attention isn't the best, having important info highlighted in my online learning resources or in journals can help me keep track of where I am.


* TLDR - This doesn't work for all journals but it can be good if you're sitting staring at a wall of text to give you a bit of background before tackling reading it all. 


* Divider tabs - If you're anything like me when writing an essay you have about 100 tabs open all at once which can get pretty overwhelming. I use this to separate the articles I still have to read and the ones I'm going to use. 


* Sprint reader - I've only used this one occasionally but it can be good to keep your attention on reading as your brain doesn't get the chance to think about anything else as it's so focused on trying to read what's going on. 


**Other bits**


A few other things I use:


* Google home - I use this to set routines and tell me when to start work, when to take breaks, and when to get back to work, This is particularly helpful when I loose track of time on my breaks


* Tablet for notetaking - I know this isn't feeable for everyone but this year I bought a tablet and pen and have been using this to keep all my notes on. Notebooks were really overwhelming for me and stressed me out so it's been a lifesaver.


* Timelapse - I am really bad at picking up my phone and going on social media or checking messages when I'm supposed to be doing my work. I've found that making a timelapse on my phone of me doing my work helps keep me off it. I tell myself ""a 30 second timelapse is my goal"" which equates to about 30 mins work on my phone (might be different for other phones) and I don't want to spoil it so I don't touch my phone while its on. 


* To-Do list - More times than not, my brain gets something random in my head that I ""need to do right this minute"", to try and combat this I have a to-do list on my desk that I write these thoughts down on. That way I can try and tell my brain that I don't need to do it right this instant and save it for later.

I am late to work every single day. I normally just blamed it on myself for being undisciplined which just made me feel worse.

But part of me feels it's not enough and maybe I should seek help more supportive towards ADHD (I mostly just picked my current doctor cause he was closet to my office not seeing if he specialized in anything about ADHD)

&amp;#x200B;

Things that sounds like ADHD that have a very negative impact on my life/are really impulsive:

\-I've been fired or in serious trouble in every single job I have had

\-I psychically cannot use my credit card cause the second I carry I balance I can't stop impulse purchasing and ended up racking up 10k in debt (and I worked in finance I should know better but as soon as the balance got too big to pay off in full my brain was like ""fuck it what's the difference"")

\-Have made legitimate plans to drastically change my life cause I was bored and have made fully fleshed out plans to move to Amsterdam, then changed that Montreal, then changed that to New York. This was just in the span of just 6 months

\-I often forget to eat because I am hyper focused on random things. Often times on weekends when I have no schedule my first meal of the day will be between 6-8pm simply because I was so wrapped up in things.

\-I change my life long goals about once a month.

\-My mind is never quiet and I am always talking and finishing other people's sentences.

\-I hyper-focus a lot. Which is great when it's on homework. Not so great when you hyperfocus for an entire week dedicated to learning everything about how plants grow and soil erosion at the detriment of your day job.

\-Quit my job on impulse to get a graduate certificate in programming; which I also signed up for on impulse.

\-The fact I'm creating this list despite having something due at midnight that I haven't started.

I have a really hard time remembering as well as initiating tasks, and although I do have good days of high functioning, today was not a good day for me and I forgot to do several things.

(To give some context, I was emotionally abused/manipulated by my bio father and stepmother as a kid and more than 90% of the time when someone starts to get angry or frustrated I become very anxious and panicky.) So I got up and put the clothes in the washer and did the dishes I was supposed to do. After I was done I went into my room to calm down, and relax while she worked on her computer. I love my mom, but she hates any sort of mess and having ADHD, we clash sometimes and I can't help but feel like my worth to her is dependant on how well I can function the way she wants me to any given day. I understand that it is frustrating, and its unrealistic to expect her not to be, but about 3 hours ago she leaves the house again, on the verge of tears and says she's going out. Obviously I am concerned because she just had surgery a week ago, but before I could say something she leaves the house.

617,,ADHD,"I am a mid 40's professional, I have spent my entire life struggling.

This year thanks to Covid I have spent a lot of time self-reflecting, I started and finished an immersion course for digital marketing. 

Part of that was spending a lot of time on social media. And a major portion of it was speaking with my peers, many of whom it turns out to have ADHD, after just a couple of days, I had some peers asking me if I had been diagnosed. 

Well, I never thought to, ADHD is not something a 40 something-year-old man has I told myself. 

So I set up an appointment with my therapist, he and I spent a couple of hours going over questions, my childhood, taking tests, etc. 

At the end he excused himself for a moment, he said after scoring the first test, out of a maximum of 100, I scored 81. He said the threshold for being considered ADHD was 46...  
And this was just the first test, he is emailing me tonight the results of the other tests as they take longer to grade and explore but having just been my therapist for a couple of years he has no doubt that ADHD is a very obvious diagnosis.

So now what?

I mean yeah it explains a lot about my life, my relationships, my childhood, my job-hopping, my imposter syndrome, the fact that I literally have done jack shit all day despite having willed myself to put socks on at least 2 dozen times (still no socks on).

618,,ADHD,"Hi All!
I have some pretty bad ADHD. I've been on Vyvanse for 4 years and I just switched to Adderal XR 30mg, and honestly it's not what I was hoping for. I've been really tired on it. It works for about 2 hours then nothing. 

ANYWAY. 
I have some serious trouble with executive function. I'm 25 and it's somewhat embarrassing to say the least. I keep trying to organize myself and when ever I get myself organized I forget where everything is, which then turns into me destroying the space I'm in to find what I'm looking for. ( and also getting distracted by the things in the midst of trying to find it)
BUT. I remember where everything is when everything is a mess. Like I can remember where my chaotic brain put stuff when I'm disorganized. It's so hard to explain. 
Anyway if anyone can offer some tips on how they stopped living like they are on a TLC episode of hoarders that would be awesome. 

I literally can keep my spaces organized for a few days then it turns into a shit storm. Everything piles up and then I go on a chaotic cleaning spree once a month then just to ""promise myself "" I won't let it get that bad again.

**TLDR: How do you get into the habit of working out, or sitting down to do some studying? How do you ""control"" your focus/willpower?** (Rewards isn't an option for me, because I don't really 'need' to study for 30 min to eat a gummy bear or work out to watch a movie, I can do both right now. In fact, I can eat the whole bag and watch movies all day.)

&amp;#x200B;

\- Story segment, skip if you'd like :)

I was diagnosed at 11, but only just recently rediscovered that I actually had the diagnosis. 22 now. I started medication last month. 30mg Concerta, plan on upping the dosage on next clinic visit.

I don't have many of the symptoms that others have, from what I gathered on this sub.

My memory is fairly good, unless I get distracted at the exact moment I try to make a mental note of whatever I want to remember.

My time perception isn't perfect, but it hasn't been a problem for me at work or during my personal time.

I'm fairly well off in the intelligence department, so I get a good understanding of new concepts and can come up with ideas/solutions before my neurotypical peers do. This has been very beneficial to me at work or during school when I didn't read up before class! I don't have the focus and willpower to sit down and study, however. I admire people like my girlfriend who can sit down and study for hours until she understands something. She is slower, but still makes a lot more progress than me, and that is what counts!

I remember being able to hyperfocus around the time I was diagnosed but haven't really been able to do it since.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here are the parts that I do find difficult: ""Getting my shit together"" and actually doing that one thing that I want to do.**

1)  I just moved to Japan a few months ago to be with my girlfriend. Therefore, I would like to learn her language. I have a solid language course/guide/whatever layed out with chapters etc. All very structured and 'easy' to go at.

I cannot for the life of me sit down and begin studying.

I have already studied a bit, and know some basic grammar and vocabulary. It is a lovely language and it appeals to me! I would love to learn more! I am quite motivated to become an adept/comfortable user of it. That motivation is just not enough for me to even sit down and read the title of a chapter.

2)  Working out / exercising. I have read that regular exercise is healthy for the mind, which really motivates me to do it. I'd also like to improve the look and feel of my body. 'Look' as in not seeing a skinny fat slob every time I look into a mirror. 'Feel' as in stronger back and legs, posture, more energy, etc.

I have come to the conclusion that the more important the completion/development of something is for me, the more difficult it is to do said task. It would be easy, albeit uninteresting, for me to look up Spanish lessons right now, but impossible to look up Japanese lessons.

&amp;#x200B;

**If anyone has good tips or advice on how I can go about improving this, I'd be very grateful!**

&amp;#x200B;

**In return, here is some advice from a lifestyle change that I found helpful:**

I rediscovered my diagnosis because I went to a psychologist on the suspicion that I was depressed. Her main focus area was depression and ADHD. She told me that depression symptoms were very common in ADHD patients who were under a lot of stress.

To solve that, I found that minimalism might be useful to me. I observed that all my stress was centered around information acquisition, objects, hobbies, and the social aspects they are connected to. I then read a book by Fumio Sasaki that really helped give a concrete and practical introduction to minimalism.

I have found that there are many different kinds of minimalism, many of them focus on money, consumerism, politics, rules etc. I'm not about that. I just looked around and asked myself if whatever object was something that I actually needed.

My current lifestyle is quite similar to what it was before I started to minimize parts of my life. I enjoy doing the same things, eat the same things, etc., but I am no longer stressed. ""Enjoy"" being the keyword in the previous sentence. I no longer have 'hobbies' that only give me a feeling of defeat because I always screwed up and gave up on projects, or bitterly continue because I had spent a lot of money or because I had to prove to other people etc. etc. I no longer have to spend hours cleaning and organizing or tormenting myself about the fact that I need to clean and organize or finish projects etc.

I can no longer forget anything when I leave the house. In fact, I don't even check if I have everything anymore, because everything is already in the pockets of my jacket and my bag. Jacket and bag. One of each. (Seasonal jacket change ofc).

All my 6 pairs of socks, 6 pairs of underwear, 5 t-shirts, and 3 sweaters are all sand color (Thanks army boot camp), so I never really spend any mental energy on clothing. I also store everything but socks and underwear on hangers, that way I don't have to fold anything other than underwear and socks, which is a lot easier. Throw in the wash, hang to dry, move to closet.

I simply removed everything that stressed me out instead of trying to 'cope' or 'manage'.

In the book, he calls the human brain ""50.000-year-old hardware"", and writes that a person today receives more information in one day than a person did in a year before the industrial revolution. I like keeping that in mind, as it has reduced my social media/news usage ""to stay up to date"" and my need for always seeking out new shit ""that would totally improve whatever if I can just whatever"".

Just don't turn ""decluttering"", ""minimizing"", ""frugality"", etc. into an addicting sport as some people do.

I'm a lot more relaxed now. It took about one month to go from depression with monthly anxiety/paranoia breakdowns to just feeling really relaxed and enjoying every day as it comes. I'd recommend it. YMMV though.

I wish everyone the best!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR: How do you get into the habit of working out, or sitting down to do some studying? How do you &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; your focus/willpower?&lt;/strong&gt; (Rewards isn&amp;#39;t an option for me, because I don&amp;#39;t really &amp;#39;need&amp;#39; to study for 30 min to eat a gummy bear or work out to watch a movie, I can do both right now. In fact, I can eat the whole bag and watch movies all day.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Story segment, skip if you&amp;#39;d like :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was diagnosed at 11, but only just recently rediscovered that I actually had the diagnosis. 22 now. I started medication last month. 30mg Concerta, plan on upping the dosage on next clinic visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have many of the symptoms that others have, from what I gathered on this sub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My memory is fairly good, unless I get distracted at the exact moment I try to make a mental note of whatever I want to remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My time perception isn&amp;#39;t perfect, but it hasn&amp;#39;t been a problem for me at work or during my personal time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m fairly well off in the intelligence department, so I get a good understanding of new concepts and can come up with ideas/solutions before my neurotypical peers do. This has been very beneficial to me at work or during school when I didn&amp;#39;t read up before class! I don&amp;#39;t have the focus and willpower to sit down and study, however. I admire people like my girlfriend who can sit down and study for hours until she understands something.

But for ADHD you get in trouble. You are just functional looking enough to be blamed. &lt;strong&gt;People are familiar with breaking rules and being punished and that&amp;#39;s what we are associated with.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

*I just have to get through the next 3 months.*

But this semester is eating me alive. I'm a graphic design major and I enjoy my classwork, but my thesis project class has me feeling stuck. I have 4 self-assigned campaigns to do, but I keep feeling like I don't have enough time to complete everything. I already cut some things out to make my deadlines easier (I plan on going back and expanding the scope after this class tho), but even still I feel like I have to scramble to keep up. On top of my hell thesis class, I'm also taking an Art History course and it's the first class in a while where I have to read a lot and write formal essays (writing is my kryptonite). I'm trying to keep track of everything with lists and my calendar, but I'm so tired and it feels like entire days just waste away without me accomplishing enough or still forgetting to take quizzes...

I don't want to talk to professors bc they'll just recommend I get help, but I can't do that in my current living situation. But I can't leave my living situation unless I graduate; it feels like I'm stuck in a loop of despair.

I'm so excited to graduate and start living life how I want it, but that can't even seem to motivate me to get my ass in gear and get my projects done. And then everyone else in my classes seem to have their shit together, with stunning portfolio pieces and extensive resumes and connections and I feel like I fall further and further behind with every passing day...

My school counsellor talked all the time about getting me tested but long story short my school sucked and never actually helped. I had a couple great teachers who helped me but were restricted in what they could do bc budget cuts and I still had ongoing other health problems and my dad got sick and died and a ton of other stuff was going on in my personal life so it kinda just got shoved to the back. 
I started to have hallucinations and some other issues this last year and a counsellor I was seeing for grief suspected something like schizoaffective disorder I went into the wait list and eventually saw a psychiatrist who wasn’t very helpful this was February last year she gave me quetiapine and basically disappeared i spoke to her twice and then she moved and said “I think you should still be seen so when you speak to someone next it won’t be me” she gave me no idea of when it would be or who or anything. She also didn’t diagnose me or anything and she only spoke to me on the phone for 15 minutes a couple times and then left. I tried bringing up the possibility of adhd to her but she was more focused on the hallucinations. 
I think the hallucinations have improved a lot and I’m doing pretty good in that aspect and I’m now wanting to do online university and I’m desperate to get my life back now. 
My question is my symptoms have been bothering me more and more the longer it goes without being addressed so what should I do now? I was going to wait to see if another psychiatrist is going to bother phoning me at some point to talk or make an appointment but now I don’t know if I should?

634,,ADHD,"
Over the summer I was taking adderall, not sleeping enoguh, and not eating enough at all. I was in a dark place because I had to stay with abusive parents. 

I didn’t get any ideas from my brain but I got really it o researching my parents mental illness and worrying about if I had it. I stumbled upon weird sites that convinced me I was an empath but now I don’t agree with that stuff. I think my left ear started ringing and I looked up the spiritual meaning and that’s how I got into this stuff but I kept digging and genuinely believed I was an “earth angel”.  I was completely convinced that these two guys who I had previously dated in the past were also earth angels bc they both gave me the same strange smile when I was talking to them. So I was convinced that they knew things about me that I didn’t know and that they were waiting for me to find out I was an earth angel. I than thought it was my job to show other people they are earth angels and believed everyone was one just waiting to be discovered and realize what they are. I obsessively researched this for hours. 

The next morning I woke up kinda doubting it and than I joked about it to my friend and realized I was stupid and that it’s not true.

I do experience times where my ear kinda rings and I feel kinda zoned out which maybe could be slight slight disassociating 

The only thing is my BMI went down to 16 Bc I was completely depressed and just realized how abusive my parents were and how they were trying to ruin and control my life. I would get so sos o so so sickly hungry and than go to get food but I’d basically threw a fit while I was getting food bc I felt awful and starved. My parents rlly don’t buy enoguh food but I only had a fit abt it bc I was in awful condition. I was on the floor crying and historic and slammed a mug into the floor. I wasn’t completely out of control and I know that I knew the mug wouldn’t hurt anyone or myself but it was an impulsive  thing.

635,,ADHD,"All I purchased was what I had on my list and I didn't forget anything. Little things like this just keep blowing my mind. I feel like I am becoming this version of myself I've been striving to be. 

Weird how something as simple as a successful grocery trip is making me emotional and strengthening this optimism I'm feeling about myself, my life, and my growing ability to function properly. 


I didn't make a duplicate purchase either. It's been a running joke with my husband and my mom when she lived with us. I forget my list (if I even remembered to make one in the first place) &amp; can't remember what I need and completely blank on what's in the fridge &amp; pantry at home. So I get what I think we may need. This resulted in having 4 tubs of sour cream in the fridge for about 2 months. The item I would forget we had and see at the store and think we needed would always change to. Over the course of 2-3 months, I might end up with 6 bottle of syrup or 5 jars if mayo or, at one point, *seven* spice jars of bay leaf.

My husband found it funny in a cute way. He definitely did give me actual shit about it, but I always still felt kinda dumb and too incompetent to go grocery shopping. 

So, I am also pleased to report, I didn't end up with several duplicates of the same item!

This is just 2 weeks in and the changes are making me feel so much better about myself.

646,,ADHD,"tl;dr I am finally able to focus (thanks to meds), but still have no energy or motivation to do any of my tasks. I’m so exhausted and overwhelmed I wish the time would stop and I could just rest, without any stress or guilt. Any advice or any words at all? Thank you!

Hi, I’m a 17 year old International Baccalaureate student and i’ve been diagnosed with ADHD at the beginning of this year. I’ve started taking Medikinet and it’s been helping a lot, yet still.... i’m so damn tired all the time. I’ve been able to focus much better, but I’m too exhausted to actually do anything productive and put my new ability to focus to use. The program at school I’m taking is overwhelming, there are so many assignments, so many responsibilities and I can’t find the energy to get up and do something about it. And that makes me extremely stressed and my thoughts start racing and ruminating. I’m bullet journaling and I write down all my responsibilities and even when I see all of them and know I must do them, I’m just unable to. I’ve tried to talk with some people, but they don’t have ADHD and even though they say they understand, I never feel like they really do understand what I’m going through. They say that I should just sleep more and tbh if I could I’d sleep for a whole week and probably still would be tired. I get from 3 to 10 hours of sleep (it depends on the day), and there’s no difference in my energy levels after 3 and 10 hours of rest. So has anyone been in a similar situation and managed to do anything about it? How do you get the energy and motivation to do stuff when you finally are able to focus? How do you deal with the crippling feeling of being extremely overwhelmed?

647,,ADHD,"Sorry if this is more suited for /r/rant, but I am the oldest brother in my family and my youngest bro has ADHD. My wife and I live with my mom and 2 younger brothers. The youngest was diagnosed with ADHD in 2019 or so, and my wife and I moved in to help my mom, who is a single mother, take care of my two younger brothers. 

The problem is that she refuses to accept any help when it comes to my brother who is suffering from ADHD. She refuses medication, which is her decision and I respect it. But she doesn't do anything else to help my brother. Doesn;t consider therapy. My brother's school gave the option, recently, for kids to go back to in-person schooling. My mom questionably says, ""It's not healthy for kid's to constantly go from Zoom schooling then back to in-person schooling"". So my brother isn't going back to school, even though my wife and I have spent a whole year supervising him at home so *we know that Zoom schooling is not the best option for him.* But my mom, and i'm going to get starkly political so be prepared, but my mom leans to the right. She's influecned by our uncle who is strictly christian conservative i.e. believes the world was created in 7 days, public schooling is brainwashing our kids to become liberal, vaccines are bad, etc. My mom doesn;t even take COVID seriously so it's not like she's holding my brother back form school due to trepidation of the virus.  

**She never thought school was bad for me and my other brother, but she thinks it's bad for our youngest brother who has ADHD.** 

Like, my wife and I can't constantly supervise my youngest brother. When he was going to school, he still struggled. however, Zoom schooling has brought his academics down even lower. He's a 5th grader at a 1st grade level. Maybe even lower. It stresses me tf out knowing that he's not getting the support he needs because my mom is stuck somewhere else. It's almost as if she's given up on my brother. She says things like, ""if he fails the 5th grade, then HE FAILS THE 5TH GRADE"" or ""If he ends up in a mental asylum, then he ends up there!"" or ""I don't think he's going to college at all"". It's like.... **don't give up on him so quickly.** He's not an idiot, he just has trouble focusing. IT'S OUR RESPONSIBLITY TO GIVE HIM THE SUPPORT HE NEEDS, whether that's medication or therapy or simply sending him back to school. 

My mom has been a single mother for a long time. She's gone through the wringer. She's gone through so much shit and I love her for being so strong. But we need more right now. All my brother cares about is his dumb YouTube videos (I fucking hate FV family or whatever the fuck it's called) and video games. No sense of urgency or responsiblity. I **hate** getting frusttrated, yelling at him, pounding the table. I wanna see him succeed. I wanna se him be able to understand how money works. I wanna see him understand how to act. Because if not, he's gonna get shit on in the real world. 

My mom constantly makes me feel bad for trying to discipline him i.e. do chores and shit. But I'm just trying to teach him responsiblity and shit. 

I'm drunk, and there's more to what I've posted. I just can't reliably get it all out. I'm just so sad, frustrated, stressed, and depressed thikning about my brother and how it feels like my mom has sorta given up on him. She doesn't put him in the best position to succeed, and when I try to do it, she chastises me and makes me feel like im some dictator or something. I just wanna see my brother succeed. I don't want to see him struggle with kindergaden math. 

Not only that, but the quarantine and pandemic makes me and my wife feel even more lonely about our situation. I don't think my mom has told many poeple in our famly about my brother's ADHD, and I think that hurts us. There are solutions, but my mom thinks continuing the same ""Oh, you didn't turn in your homework this month? NO GAMES AND TV FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR...."" then a week later, he's still playing games and watching YouTube. 

Of course, I can talk to my mom, but the task is daunting. Daunting because no mom likes to be told they're doing things wrong, especially from their own child. 

Again, just a rant. I fucking hate getting frustrated at my brother when doing homework. I hate yelling at him, I hate pounding the table out of frustration, I hate seeing him struggle with simple math, I hate seeing him cry over school. WE NEED PROFESSIONAL HELP AND MY MOM ISN'T GETTING IT. 

I love ya'll. I love that there's a community like this. It makes me feel less alone. I am just at my wit's end. I don't know how to approach this. Like, I've meticulously practiced what I would say to my mom. I;ve made sure not to offend her. I've made sure to watch my words. But the actual act of telling her fills me with anxiety, and then depression. It's debilitating. It feels like my mom has given up on my youngest brother.

649,,ADHD,"I’m medicated and been diagnosed for the last 16 years since late teens. 

I started a job 6 months ago where they told me all training provided but threw me in the deep end with more work than what is possible in the hours I have, and provided a 3 day handover but it only covered basics and not any of the extra things I’m asked. 

Only the owner of the small business usually knows specific answers to questions about equipment issues (my job is managing scientific instrument returns from hire) and some things will maybe be another person in the office. 

Anyway my manager took my aside to ‘see how I was going’ and I replied honestly that I was stressed about the increasing workload and the expectations to do things I wasn’t trained for (regulatory and licensing stuff).

However I don’t know how I feel about this conversation as she proceeded to tell me that she could see I was stressed and that I’m too loud in the open plan office (sighing or responding verbally to a bad email ‘nooo, you’re kidding!’ Echoes through the office from the back wall where I’m in a corner. She said others see me like this and they stress out. 
Also she said to phrase my questions to the boss (only person who can help most of the time) in a way that have solutions already so the boss isn’t troubled, and also try and ask the other woman more often. So far this is okay I guess it’s constructive criticism.

But:  the part making me feel awful is that she then said
“And the boss has taken the last few days off for stress leave, mainly due to service department”.
Which I take as them blaming me for someone else’s stress. 
I suggested I change hours from 3 short days to 2 long ones (I feel I’ll be more productive) which was shot down.
Then she said “so if you need anything...”
I was like, yeah I’m stressed...
Then nothing much just a chat about what’s due this week.

I left feeling completely awful like she didn’t offer solutions to reduce workload just basically told me to stop asking questions / stop being stressed and that I caused my boss’s stress leave.

My psychiatrist has said last week when I saw him that I should quit that the environment isn’t right.

I just want some outside perspectives I’m driving my partner mad with being panicky about this job all the time.
I will probably quit today.

It makes me feel like I’ll never have a good job and I’m just shit at all jobs.

Also she said to phrase my questions to the boss (only person who can help most of the time) in a way that have solutions already so the boss isn’t troubled, and also try and ask the other woman more often. So far this is okay I guess it’s constructive criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But:  the part making me feel awful is that she then said
“And the boss has taken the last few days off for stress leave, mainly due to service department”.
Which I take as them blaming me for someone else’s stress. 
I suggested I change hours from 3 short days to 2 long ones (I feel I’ll be more productive) which was shot down.
Then she said “so if you need anything...”
I was like, yeah I’m stressed...
Then nothing much just a chat about what’s due this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left feeling completely awful like she didn’t offer solutions to reduce workload just basically told me to stop asking questions / stop being stressed and that I caused my boss’s stress leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My psychiatrist has said last week when I saw him that I should quit that the environment isn’t right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want some outside perspectives I’m driving my partner mad with being panicky about this job all the time.
I will probably quit today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It makes me feel like I’ll never have a good job and I’m just shit at all jobs.
I really feel down about being ADHD at the moment I feel like it’s ruining everything.&lt;/p&gt;

650,,ADHD,"My wonderful best friend has ADHD and is trying to mange cooking and housework. She needs lists/trackers for external accountability, and the reward boost.

So she rotates frequently between downloadable task PDF's but they have a lot that she doesn't care about or stress her out in other ways.

My idea was to have a jar with tasks for each of those categories so she pulls one out and can have the boost of seeing it in a ""completed"" jar. Also she doesn't know what she is going to be doing so it keeps things changing frequently. I'm wondering if the big monthly ones should have a playlist link on it and a reward jar that she can pick a fun thing from after it's done. Also she will probably swap out ones she really doesn't want to do that day so hopefully by the end of a month we will know which are the hardest most dreaded tasks for her and figure out if me or her SO can help pitch in with those in some way.

656,,ADHD,"I have noticed that I constantly think about the present. The past and future doesn't matter. Only the present. I think anyone with ADHD can relate... 

Let's change that! 

Do you have a list of endless stuff to do? Great! Let's create some buckets for it.

Ask yourself: do you need to complete this task today? Right NOW? Do you really need to organize your sock drawer now? Really? Or is your anxiety high due to the tasks you are avoiding and you are suppressing those feelings by doing other things instead? 

Once you have prioritized your tasks, put the top 3-5 tasks on your DAILY list and leave the other ones behind. Ignore them. Don't even look at them. Put them on a separate list and keep them away from your mind.

Tackle the daily list first. End of the day, reassess your daily list- what did you complete? Everything? Half of it? Or only a few things? Was it due to lack of time or lack of motivation? Either way... award yourself for making progress! If you didn't complete everything, that's OKAY! Be proud of what you've accomplished and move the other items to the next day if needed. 

Once you have completed everything on your top 3-5 task list, then you can visit your master list and pick your new top daily task lists to complete. 

Tomorrow will always be there! Do your best! If you are having a bad day, take a break and do something else if you can! Don't be hard on yourself! Minimize the clutter in your head by writing everything down, prioritize your list of things you want to do, and begin working on that list one day at the time. Let's be real, that list grows every day too! However, using our time as we desire is important for our mental health and planning ahead of time can help minimize our anxiety.

668,,ADHD,"TLDR: At 35 y.o., my first visit to a psychiatrist was filled with him talking a lot about himself, interrupting me, and being a terrible listener. I left without a diagnosis and was prescribed Adderall. Not sure what to do with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 35 year old male who scheduled my first ever psychiatrist visit after months of researching ADHD and wondering if I have it.

To start, I was asked to fill out an Adult ADHD Assessment, which is the first Google Image result when searching 'adult adhd test.' Below are a couple of highlights from our session.

He began by asking about my background and history, which seemed normal enough, but then he began interrupting me at various points when I didn't give an answer that he found sufficient. For example, he asked me questions about my business sales, but because I didn't give him a one sentence answer, he said that I was refusing to answer the question. Then he went on a monologue about the things he did when opening his own practice (I didn't know I was attending a business seminar). He made sure to highlight how much better he was at running a business, even though I hadn't really told him that much about mine. I had to interrupt him at one point and ask, ""what's the point?"" Otherwise, he would've kept going.

I have always struggled with my weight, but have it under control these days with a good plan in place. I've had success losing and keeping weight off in the past, but gained it back when I got busy with my business. He suggested bariatric surgery at one point, and I said that wasn't an option. He brought it up again multiple times throughout our session, even though I was direct in saying 'no.' It was bizarre.

At one point he told me ""if you don't have ADHD, then you have something weird."" I couldn't believe how unprofessional that was. It felt like I knew more about ADHD than he did. 

At the end, he prescribed me Adderall and went on a rant about the similarities and differences between Adderall and meth. I zoned out here because I was tired of listening to him. 

Has anyone else experienced something similar? Should I get a second opinion? I have a hard time trusting this guy.

676,,ADHD,"I'm a 21 year old female, just diagnosed with ADHD a week ago (though I'd be suspecting it for a long while), I started on Vyvanse the same day as my diagnosis and my doctor (she's awesome) is really confident that its the right diagnosis and that 40mg will likely be a good dose for me. She started me on 20mg this week, then 30mg next week, then up to 40mg and then we have a follow up.

The first day of 20mg I felt like I was wearing glasses for the first time, it was amazing. I still feel like that, clear, focused, but I've noticed that it seems to wear off around 1pm (I'm taking it at about 8am) and for me this has meant feeling dizzy and headachy and yeah. I basically get amazing work done in the mornings and in the afternoon I can't even read a paragraph without getting a headache and I just cant focus on the words enough to absorb them? if that makes sense? its really uncomfortable and I can't get work done. I need to get work done because I'm a 4th year undergrad and about to graduate and keep my grades up for grad school.

I know that its probably that the dose is just too low, I tend to metabolize drugs like anesthetics really quickly, or so my dentist has told me lol - apparently its a redhead thing? (I don't buy it but whatever)

Anyway, I want to stay on the Vyvanse because it helps me A LOT and before I was on it I was really struggling. I guess I'm just wondering: Will this crash go away as I'm getting used to the stimulant? will it go away will a heavier dose? if it doesn't go away, does anyone have any tips for managing the crash?

I'm obviously really new to this whole community so if there is anything that you would tell your 'just diagnosed' self if you could, I'd love to hear it! I really appreciate any advice!

Edit: Also, I find that if anything I sleep better on Vyvanse than I did before which is weird right? cause it's supposed to cause insomnia? Also, I am now able to talk myself out of expensive food orders BUT I'm so indecisive about what to eat when I'm hungry so I don't really eat much cause it's too hard for me to choose so I move on to the next task. Because I now just move on to the next issue and am able to stop myself from ordering uber eats, I don't know how to eat anymore...help. I honestly just need like an ADHD guardian angel helping me.

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not the point here, though. After I tied the noose, I was quite impressed with my skills. It was a damn good knot. So for about 2 hours after that I just researched various knots and perfected them. In hindsight, I just thought this was a pretty damn funny story that really describes the ADHD experience.&lt;/p&gt;

Meantime I have developed ""systems"" that made me productive and being able to function. I am working in the digital marketing field - so the work is mainly mental. I have become really good at my profession - mainly thanks to coffee. But while being stimulated I knew that my brain is working at 3% and my potential is so much bigger but I had turned down many opportunities.

After years of drinking 4-5 cups of coffee I have developed problems with anxiety and not being able to concentrate while on caffeine (8 months ago)  - I had to quit it. In this time I really pushed myself to do the work but every day was harder and harder.

My ability to work had gone down to the point I had to go to the doctor since I didn't know why I can't focus anymore. I also took time off work.

I have been diagnosed with ""mental burnout"" due to my constant pushing in the last 8 months. While the doctor diagnosed me with ADHD (initiative) and told me to go to the psychiatrist.

I have started with Strattera 4 days ago while being diagnosed with ADHD at 29 years old. While I know that Strattera takes some time to work - but it's kind of weird.  I feel very low -  I am unable to speak, think, focus while on the Strattera. Like in ""zombie"" mode 24/7.

Yesterday I was like ""f\*\*\* it"" - and drank some coffee. Immediately I have become ""woken up"" to the point where I could do some focused work for one hour.

At the moment I am drinking my 3rd coffee today and I have no problem writing this post. Every time that coffee wears down - I enter ""zombie"" mode again and leaves me that jittery feeling.

It looks like my brain needs to be stimulated. While the original plan from my psychiatrist was - we will try Strattera and then Wellbutrin since with Ritalin there is a possibility for addiction.

Also, in her words - Ritalin is prescribed only for ""hardcore"" ADHD examples. Currently, in my country - the only available medications for ADHD are Ritalin or Strattera. Nothing else.

I feel like my brain needs something to be stimulated with. Is this normal? In 4 days I have a checkup call with my psychiatrist.

Could be beneficial for me to try Ritalin since all my life the coffee was the only thing that helped me?

I really don't want to create a ""self diagnose"" but from knowing my body and how I function - I really don't want to be put on antidepressants like Wellbutrin.

If you have any advice I would be really happy to hear it but if not thank you for reading this, i understand that nobody on the internet can solve my problems but I guees I just needed to let it out somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

703,,ADHD," 

I’m depressed and hate my job. I started waking up at 6 am naturally on the weekends and sleeping late and not get enough sleep just to maximize the time away from work, I’m not doing so well fellas.

Not sure how to overcome this and I'm too paralyzed by anxiety to truly enjoy my time away from work 

Feel like I'm becoming an NPC 

Is this all there is to life. Now I know why my teen angst was so bad when it was... I was dreading all of this and I had a right to.

Sometimes I cry and want to be a teenager again. it feels like for my entire life everyone has been in a hurry to grow up and at every stage, every milestone of life, I just long for the past and wish we could just slow the fuck down for one second. When all my peers have engaged and taken on the challenge of growing older I feel like I have always been one step behind. Is this an ADHD thing? Really, it worsens my feelings of alienation. I vividly remember getting bullied for being 12 and still acting like it, it felt like my peers were interested in dating and social politics and I was still acting like a pure child, just prioritizing fun and being authentic and still doing ""immature"" things. 

Maybe not enough of my friends are going through 20s angst like I am. I've started going through it when I turned 22 and it hasn't stopped since -- I mean, I feel like I haven't been able to catch a breath and enjoy life without losing my mind and anxiety on overdrive, like I'm running out of time to form my identity, to find my career, etc. 

How can someone as immature and childish as me and whimsical gain satisfaction from growing up and doing grown-up things? btw I'm 23 and turning 24 this year and I've felt like garbage just thinking about it. My anxiety is so bad, I can't even go a day without thinking how I'm one day closer to aging and dreading the depression from that. It's like each birthday gets worse and worse.

705,,ADHD,"So...

I picked up circuitry and arduino stuff as a hobby my senior year of highschool, so I went to UTD for Electrical Engineering. 

Little did I know I would absolutely DREAD the core classes I had to take, and ended up getting a D in US history, a C+ in Calc III, an F in some stupid intro to college course that made us do STUPID little projects and a C in chemistry.

HOWEVER I got an A in Computer Science and an A+ and a 100 on my final for Intro to electrical engineering, classes I actually liked.

That was first semester. Second semester I ended up falling in a depression pit and stopped going to classes, it was too much, I hated it.

So I dropped out of college. My brother graduated from college and decides to move to New Mexico and invited me to move in with him. I say sure why not it would be nice to get away and see my cousins who live in ABQ.

That plan goes terribly, I could either never find a job there (because I didn’t try hard enough) or I didn’t hold a job for very long because I couldn’t wake up on time. I was never able to pay a single month of rent out of the 6 months I was there and my mom had to help pay for it, I felt like a spoiled piece of shit.

I move back to where I live and I decide that I want to go to school for music composition, I’m actually a pretty good musician if I don’t say so myself, I knew that if I could put in the work that I could actually make it as a music producer or recording engineer or even a jazz pianist.

But I couldn’t put in the work, as much as I said to myself that music is my passion, deep down I knew that I wasn’t as obsessed as other successful music producers, I wasn’t the same level of obsessed in music as I was to rocket league in which I have 2,000 hours logged. With rocket league i was OBSESSED with getting better, now I am top 1% of players in that game. If only I had the motivation to be top 1% of musicians haha. I just think music is really cool but I’m not obsessed. I ended up dropping out of music school, but I still learned a lot from it. I went to music school for a year and dropped out right when Covid started.

For the first 5 months of Covid I just hermited hardcore at my parents place. My parents have been suggesting I get a job but Im like “ehhhhhhhhhhhhh yea I’ll try”, but I just procrastinate and end up not getting a job. Pretty sure this is depression, I can’t find an inch of motivation to find a simple job.

I turned 21 in July and start going to clubs and end up catching Covid, I quarantined in my room and somehow didn’t give it to my parents. I actually made a lot of connections through clubbing, I found out about underground warehouse raves and got paid DJ gigs occasionally from networking. I knew DJing wasn’t enough though, and I wasn’t grinding music producing everyday.

My friend on discord one day decides that he’s going to drop out of college and become a self taught web developer. I was like “oh that’s cool my moms a web developer so I actually know the basics”. He shows me his website and the design is absolute garbage lol, it looks like a 2005 website. I show him how to make it look more modern and show him ways to organize his code. He says “bro we should learn this together”. I think yea this could actually give me direction. I make a basic website for myself, but then I’m like “hmm now what, I guess I’ll play some rocket league or something”

My dad notices that I was interested in web development and said that I could do devmountain.com a web dev course that’s 9am to 5pm for 13 weeks.

I’m like holy shit this is it

This is what I’ve been needing

Something that can give me DEFINITIVE STEPS on what I need to learn to become a web developer

No bullshit core classes, just straight coding, something I actually LIKE.

I can’t stop thinking about what life what be like earning 70k a year and being able to afford things and not feel like a bum.

This course is giving me hope that I’ve never felt before

I told my mom to wake me up at 8am every weekday and shove an adderall down my throat to make me wake up (this works).

I start April and I am hoping that I have what it takes to do this course, and I feel like the pressure that my parents are paying $7700 for this course will motivate me for sure, I also told ALL of my friends that I’m going to complete this course and that I will be making big money soon.

708,,ADHD,"I've been diagnosed for about two years now, and since then have tried at least a dozen different medication varieties, but so far none have had any real significant affect on me as far as I can tell.

As of now, I've gone back to 40mg of instant-release Adderall, and every so often I'll notice it a little but not very often. Meanwhile though my sister and mother who both have extremely similar issues that I do (I'd bet the farm they both have undiagnosed ADHD as well) have tried doses as low as 5mg and had exceptional results. 
I'm happy for them, of course! It's just baffling to me because I've been putting in the work for 2+ years to try and nail down what I'm doing wrong, and this just further confuses me. We have similar genetics, identical lifestyles and eating habits, but somehow I get less benefits from 8x the doses they need.

Have any of you had problems similarly to this before? I'd just really like to know what else I could try looking into.

If it matters: I've tried plenty of behavioral adjustments and organization systems, I go to therapy regularly both individual and ADHD-specific groups, and exercise and sleep decently. I have anxiety issues and depression, but I deal with those with my therapist. I take my vitamins, eat my veggies, and get good amounts of sunlight too.
As far as medications go I've tried: Stratterra, Adderall IR and XR, Ritalin, Concerta, Bupropion, Focalin, Gabapentin, Lexapro, Vyvanse, Abilify, Wellbutrin and many more at many doses. Some had *maybe* a subtle effect but never anything substantial or consistent. (I didn't even notice side effects for any of them either, so couldn't even really tell if they were working at all, haha).

&lt;p&gt;As of now, I&amp;#39;ve gone back to 40mg of instant-release Adderall, and every so often I&amp;#39;ll notice it a little but not very often. Meanwhile though my sister and mother who both have extremely similar issues that I do (I&amp;#39;d bet the farm they both have undiagnosed ADHD as well) have tried doses as low as 5mg and had exceptional results. 
I&amp;#39;m happy for them, of course! It&amp;#39;s just baffling to me because I&amp;#39;ve been putting in the work for 2+ years to try and nail down what I&amp;#39;m doing wrong, and this just further confuses me. We have similar genetics, identical lifestyles and eating habits, but somehow I get less benefits from 8x the doses they need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have any of you had problems similarly to this before? I&amp;#39;d just really like to know what else I could try looking into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it matters: I&amp;#39;ve tried plenty of behavioral adjustments and organization systems, I go to therapy regularly both individual and ADHD-specific groups, and exercise and sleep decently. I have anxiety issues and depression, but I deal with those with my therapist. I take my vitamins, eat my veggies, and get good amounts of sunlight too.
As far as medications go I&amp;#39;ve tried: Stratterra, Adderall IR and XR, Ritalin, Concerta, Bupropion, Focalin, Gabapentin, Lexapro, Vyvanse, Abilify, Wellbutrin and many more at many doses. Some had &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; a subtle effect but never anything substantial or consistent. (I didn&amp;#39;t even notice side effects for any of them either, so couldn&amp;#39;t even really tell if they were working at all, haha).&lt;/p&gt;

709,,ADHD,"I have been diagnosed with ADHD+Autism (and some other stuff, woot!) since I was a young kid, but have never been properly medicated. I tried Concerta when I was young but couldn't remember it, leading to issues later in my adult life.

I have basically been on a WHOLE bunch of antidepressants from my GP, and have never had an adult psychiatrist. Once I hit 18 I was basically lost to the system. 

Cue this year: 

After a bunch of trauma, trying to get psych help, and continually being basically denied, I finally got a psychiatrist, he didn't ask many questions, I never got enough time to describe all my symptoms and history so he tried to put me on prozac to no avail, so I asked about ADHD and he ended up giving me Concerta (for the second time in my life). I took it for a few days but felt like I was dying with heart palpitations and panic attacks, I felt horrible and stopped taking them, calling him as soon as I could. 

Due to all sorts of traumatic events, I moved house twice while with this doctor and the next time I called, he basically wrote a list of recommended meds to give to my GP and then dropped me due to location (due to covid, I had never met him in person, only spoke over the phone, so this was confusing) 

Now I'm on Vyvanse for the first time with possible euphoria and very mildly elevated BP and HR headaches every evening and no psychiatrist. Due to past crappy meds really messing with my brain, I have been worried and panicking every morning when I'm not on the meds, but this seems to go away when I take them (which worsens my fears for euphoria, or even mania?!)

Does anyone else have fear and anxiety on new meds? Has anyone else basically been lost in the psych system? I feel like the only way I can get help is if I am near death but I REALLY don't want to ever get to that point... how does one get that care system that they show on TV where a doctor and a psychiatrist and a psychologist work together to help you?

As soon as I started reading about ADHD, my whole life started to make sense and I relate to every single thing I read. I didn’t even know my tics were tics until I realised they had a name and weren’t common. 

The one thing I am struggling with / slightly confused about, however, is although I relate more to the inattentive type of ADHD, one thing that does stick out is how disruptive I was at school. I was the ‘class clown’ and would constantly be talking and joking and arguing with the teachers, traits which I feel I have carried with to adult life as I regularly get told at work I can talk too much (although i’m good at my job so they dont really highlight it much). 

The disruptive trait, along with not being able to shut up or wait my turn to talk is the main thing I resonate with from the Hyperactive category. 

I have a LOT of problems with executive dysfunction too. 

My main question I guess, is this more factors of combined ADHD? I can barely find any info on the combined type! 

Can someone truly be both? I am still learning about it all :) 

If anyone is like how I described, a bit of both, it would be really helpful to hear your stories!

*EDIT: I also feel as though my symptoms of hyper-activeness vary in different situations, eg. I’m a lot more talkative and find it hard to stop talking and not bug everyone around me when i’m at work, but in social settings i have trained myself to take the backseat in fear of not being listened to.

&lt;p&gt;The disruptive trait, along with not being able to shut up or wait my turn to talk is the main thing I resonate with from the Hyperactive category. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a LOT of problems with executive dysfunction too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main question I guess, is this more factors of combined ADHD? I can barely find any info on the combined type! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can someone truly be both? I am still learning about it all :) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone is like how I described, a bit of both, it would be really helpful to hear your stories!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*EDIT: I also feel as though my symptoms of hyper-activeness vary in different situations, eg. I’m a lot more talkative and find it hard to stop talking and not bug everyone around me when i’m at work, but in social settings i have trained myself to take the backseat in fear of not being listened to. I think this could be a coping mechanism and a way to not embarrass myself but thought it was interesting when looking at different types of situations in which hyperactivity comes to play.&lt;/p&gt;

718,,ADHD,"TL;DR: From GP call to consultation with NHS Psychiatrist in less than a month.

Hey all, I have some ""behaviours"" that I believe could be symptoms of ADHD, but I was always able to pretend all was fine by compensating with hyper-focus (which is EXHAUSTIVE!) . This wasn't so much of a problem at school when things were simple and easy, but became progressively harder when I started Uni and even worst as I advanced in my career. 

Anyways, my case isn't the point here. 

About three weeks ago I decided to look for help. I called my GP to inform them I wanted to see a psychiatrist privately, but would like to know if they could write the prescriptions (if it came to that). I didn't even consider getting in the NHS waiting line as I heard horror stories of 3-5 years waiting times.

My GP immediately stopped me and said ""you know, we have an amazing psychiatry team available and I would really prefer you going to them, who I know and trust"". He told me they run triage sessions every week so I would know if I was included in the waiting list or not in 1-2 weeks. I saw no harm in trying but didn't keep my hopes up. 

A bit more than a week later I get a letter saying that I was included in the waiting list (dated a three days after the call) and a couple of days after that, a call from the psychiatrist's office asking if I could attend a video appointment in two weeks. 

It took less than a month between the first call with the GP to the date of the first appointment with psychiatrist! 

I am absolutely over the moon! 

Now, I am aware this is probably not the same for all the NHS regions but if you are being put off to call your GP because you think it will be pointless, do it! CALL THEM! Talk to them and ask how often they triage the cases. Make notes before the appointment and explain how that affects your life.

721,,ADHD,"I’m so so so tired of stupid little mistakes.

My work recently went through stints of 7 days straight working followed by 7 days off. (Covid) Even with meds my brain was so tired it wouldn’t pick up on little things at the end of day checks leading to mistakes. So boss agreed a reasonable accommodation for this is that my colleague would do checks on the Sundays and I would focus on other end of day tasks. 

Recently we went back to normal schedule which included weekend cover. So most weeks mon to Friday but occasionally mon-sun followed by a shorter wed-Friday week to cover weekend.  I would be in on my own over the weekend during my 7 days as that’s the way we work. I felt sick with nerves but took my time to do the checks and left feel anxious but confident I’d done the best I could. 

I’m off for two days but just got a message from colleague at work that a lid wasn’t wedged on properly. The type of containers in my line of work don’t have clicks or seals and the lids are made by us out of Perspex. When you put them on top it’s mostly just to stop stuff dropping down. For a few of them however it’s expected we wedge them down for safe measure. Which I usually do as I’m scared of fucking up. 

Yesterday the lid in question was on top and nothing poked out the side but it wasn’t wedged down.  So when I checked at end of day my brain went yeah the lids are on. Now some bad stuff has happened to stock overnight. Normally if it wasn’t wedged on it would all be okay, but last night it wasn’t wedged and the fluke chance ,just in case, stuff happened. Some stock is spoiled and I feel sick. 

I’m panicking as I’m already staring down the barrel of a competency review. I’m trying so hard to stop this stuff from happening. I never make the same mistake twice but it’s so hard to know when what I’m perceiving is adhd brain filling in gaps or actually there. This is my dream job and I work so hard and do well in other areas of the work. But the kind of job I’m in these mistakes just can’t happen and my contract includes working weekends so I can’t avoid them. 

I just feel so broken and knotted up inside. I’m dreading going in Wednesday. My boss hasn’t messaged anything which either means it’s fine and will be marked as an everyone remember to double check (as I’m not the only one) or their waiting for me to finish my days off as I’ll be pulled aside for another reprimand and potentially the competency review as it’s yet another mistake from Grey.

I just want to stop being broken. I try so hard and take on what people say. I always take precautions and into account my stupid brain so big mistakes never happen but this little stuff.

&lt;p&gt;At age 26, I have six more months until I am off my parent&amp;#39;s health insurance. An aspect that unfortunately plays a massive role in my life thanks to my ADHD. It seems as if i have two choices: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a union job/ sell my soul to the City&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attempt to get off my medication by the time age 27 comes around&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question today is how does one with a mind that shifts directions every other second decide on a future? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you live life one day at a time, tomorrow seems so far away...&lt;/p&gt;

When I got to college, where you are expected to be organized, to do homeworks every day or at least every 2 days, I struggled a fair bit. I was able to make my way through with the support of my mom and my friends, but my grades were never amazing. I failed a few class but was able to barely pass most of them. Now with covid forcing me to work 100% from home, the struggle for way worse. I can barely listen during classes, being distracted by my phone/computer all class long. I tried to force myself to listen to class using only my phone, which forced me to not do anything else at the same time since multitasking is hard when you're listening to class on your phone only. But i ended up just letting my mind wander around. Then there's the fact that my field of study is software development, so i need to be productive on my computer.

I take maximum dose of Vivance (60mg) as well as Stratera (60mg) and Sertraline (50mg) for stress and focus, yet i can't focus well. We obviously cannot increase the medication 😅

733,,ADHD,"I don't know where to begin, but I know the reason why I am writing this. There is something seriously wrong with me and that is gravely limiting my abilities. I feel like I am incapable of achieving anything, my mind is a very dark place and also it is my dreamland, my ecstasy. I can say that long ago I created my own world within my own mind where everything was set on my own rules and where every thought, every idea, every fantasy, every worst nightmare came to a reality, where I vividly experienced and relished everything and anything that I desired for, it was and is far more better than my actual reality.

737,,ADHD,"Hi! So I made a post yesterday about wanting to switch medications. I’ve deleted it now because I realised I made some mistakes and left out some important details. Really appreciate everyone who responded though - thank you! 

I forgot to mention that I’m also diagnosed with GAD, which I’m currently on 20mg Prozac for. I’ve found that methylphenidate (both Concerta and Medikinet) has increased my anxiety. It manifests physically in increased heart rate, restlessness, rapid breathing, intensifying my anxiety tics. But it’s also caused me racing thoughts and it’s been a lot easier for me to spiral into overthinking patterns. I would describe it as feeling like there’s a bunch of versions of me in my head talking over eachother, overthinking multiple things at once.

The two medications I’ve gotten the best reviews on were Vyvanse and Straterra. Does anyone know which of these might be least likely to give me psychiatric side effects? Or if anyone has any other suggestions, that would also be great. I’m diagnosed with GAD, but I had a short period of extreme suicidal depression last year so I don’t want anything that could trigger that again.

739,,ADHD,"One of my more significant ADHD habits is my spaciness. Usually it's most evident with the time it takes for me to get ready, or the moderate clutter in my house. But last night my cat ate some medicine that on the coffee table. I had put it away, but it must have been after he ate some of it. My partner was LIVID, which is reasonable, and they kept trying to get me to talk to them about my spaciness and why it happened but I wouldn't participate because I knew they were going to yell at me. The adrenaline rush just pushed me into action and I called the pet poison control line, we took the cat to the emergency vet, and it ended up being somewhat okay. I felt really guilty about the situation, so I cleaned up most of the vomit in the house. We somewhat talked about it, and my partner insisted they weren't trying to yell at me, they just had high emotions. I don't know though, I was scared. They had hit a wall (not that hard) when the cat threw up for the 4th time.

Anyway, when we got the cat back, we were getting ready for bed when my partner noticed a cup on the floor and I quickly remembered that it was a leftover cup of cleaning solution and scooped it up. My partner went OFF on me again and was basically like ""We just talked about this, I can't believe you would leave stuff out again, what the heck is going through your head"" etc. I tried to be nice to myself about all of this because I usually am very attentive to my cat and this happens to pet owners who don't have ADHD too. But my partner has been vocal lately about how bothered they are about my spaciness, even when I'm just getting ready to go out by myself or something that doesn't affect him. I tried to say I didn't want to talk about it, I thought they were going to attack me about it. They insisted we talk anyway and I ended up getting very emotional and saying that this is a part of myself that I hate but am trying to work on and that it was hard to be nice to myself if they kept going in on me about it. 

Obviously at this point I need to change my habits. I could set a timer when we're getting ready together so I don't hold us up and I could try to put stuff away as soon as possible and watch out for stuff I shouldn't let my cat get to.

740,,ADHD,"Hi all,

I've recently come to the realisation that I may have ADHD. I've just today reached out to a doctor to try and get in touch with a psychiatrist. I think early in life I managed to fly under the radar. I had behavioural issues and I was very tardy, disorganised and lacked motivation, but I was always ""smart enough"" to get by. I did okay in secondary school, achieving good grades in the end but never really put in the effort to reach my full potential. For example, I could never study due to how boring it was except on the bus to school on the day of the exams. I also have dyslexia which I think only compounds the issue.

Later in life I went to university and this is when I think it caught up to me. I no longer had a large support structure and needed to be more self reliant. Studying was so mind numbing and I'd often procrastinate. I failed my first year, but was allowed to retake it, only to fail it a second time resulting in me dropping out.

I managed to get an interview for an apprenticeship (based in the UK). The apprenticeship involved a degree again but thankfully I met my girlfriend who is the complete antithesis of me. I don't think I would have made it this far into my apprenticeship without her. She helps me organise and structure my study. 

I've read on this subreddit that people experience hyperfocus alot. This is something that resonates with me. I'll pick up hobbies and will dive straight it putting a large amount of my daily mental error into it.

I have a few more things that I believe may be ADHD related. I'm very forgetful, discorganised and zone in and out of conversations amongst other things.

&lt;p&gt;As you probably figured out I’m still not diagnosed / medicated so I’m new to the world of ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for the response:)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the character limit: Why is it still here. Why can’t i just ask a short question? Wambam mf&lt;/p&gt;

756,,ADHD,"A summary. I moved abroad with my dad and can't write the language but I can understand most of it. My dad had told me previously (a year ago) to look for classes that could make me more familiar with the language and the career I want to study (like Chemistry courses in Portuguese in order to learn the different nomenclatures n shit).

Naturally I researched for an hour after he told me and proceeded to never look into it again. Now I'm in Brazil. He gave up and sent me a link for a course and fuck it, this one it is. But. I just looked into the registration page and I'm already feeling burnout. Idk if it's understimulation, that terrible borderline nausea feeling of dread you feel in your belly when you contemplate everyhing you *have* to do and lose all willpower for it.

In all my years of school, I can't remember one time I sat down and studied that wasn't a final exam. The funny thing is that I don't find studying dreadful. I actually find it stimulating. That said, the *idea* of sitting down to study fills me with *so much dread* that most of my school life most of my homeworks were done between hours at school the same day I had to deliver them and I studied by reading friends' notes/the book minutes prior to the test. I never failed a subject but my grades are average at best.

I know I can't have this lifestyle in college. Even my LoL-obsessed brother has a routine and structure for college and he's studying *business* , I'm seeking a career in *biomedicine* . My dad doesn't believe I have ADHD even though my mom was diagnosed and that I'm pretty sure I have it so therapy/medication isn't available, and I can't legally get a job either, so I survived my last schoolyear by learning theough cheating and Fosfo b12. Idk if it works but it gives me hope.

He gave up and sent me a link for a course and fuck it, this one it is. But. I just looked into the registration page and I&amp;#39;m already feeling burnout. Idk if it&amp;#39;s understimulation, that terrible borderline nausea feeling of dread you feel in your belly when you contemplate everyhing you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to do and lose all willpower for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all my years of school, I can&amp;#39;t remember one time I sat down and studied that wasn&amp;#39;t a final exam. The funny thing is that I don&amp;#39;t find studying dreadful. I actually find it stimulating. That said, the &lt;em&gt;idea&lt;/em&gt; of sitting down to study fills me with &lt;em&gt;so much dread&lt;/em&gt; that most of my school life most of my homeworks were done between hours at school the same day I had to deliver them and I studied by reading friends&amp;#39; notes/the book minutes prior to the test. I never failed a subject but my grades are average at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I can&amp;#39;t have this lifestyle in college. Even my LoL-obsessed brother has a routine and structure for college and he&amp;#39;s studying &lt;em&gt;business&lt;/em&gt; , I&amp;#39;m seeking a career in &lt;em&gt;biomedicine&lt;/em&gt; . My dad doesn&amp;#39;t believe I have ADHD even though my mom was diagnosed and that I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I have it so therapy/medication isn&amp;#39;t available, and I can&amp;#39;t legally get a job either, so I survived my last schoolyear by learning theough cheating and Fosfo b12. Idk if it works but it gives me hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sucks, but at least I spent an hour setting up the college laptop (by setting up I mean looking and adding several anime themes to google.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least my dad has a cute dog and a parrot that hates me :/&lt;/p&gt;

767,,ADHD,"idk about anyone else but having a tv on 20 hours a day is not normal.

i already struggle to focus, i had to completely give up doing homework at home, the extra roadblock is just too much.

whenever i bring up that the tv might be a problem my 'parents' flip out with total denial. i've also stopped asking for things because they'd rather complain so they can sit and watch more tv than actually being parents. the one wave of motivation i have to do a task and getting shutdown immediately kills me. i just dont try again.

on days were they also have to have the radio on, i end up with a massive headache and cant do anything for the rest of the day.

whenever i vent to friends i just get the 'have you tried this' response, i've tried it all, it either does nothing or just makes it worse for myself. (the seashell sound ontop of slightly muffled tv is why i struggle to keep noise canceling ear protection on for more than a few minutes)

might be this thing i recently heard of called APD (auditory processing disorder)(i have more symptoms, they are just not the focus of this post), me trying to convince my parents to actually take me to a doctor isn't possible, at least i can now start looking for ways to try to manage this part of myself.",t2_1423t0,False,,0,False,auditory struggles &amp; tv obsessed parents,[],r/ADHD,False,0,red,0,,,False,t3_m09zmq,False,light,0.99,,public,11,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Rant/Vent,False,11,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1615215128.0,text,0,,,text,self.ADHD,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;idk about anyone else but having a tv on 20 hours a day is not normal.&lt;/p&gt;

Finally got a psychiatrist who recommended the three meds in the title. I took a genetic medication test which more or less said “stimulant=bad” but I’m not so sure. It makes a large decision over a certain allele so I’m not sure if it’s a one size fits all approach.

My concerns:
Wellbutrin: apparently one of the rare side effects are seizures. I do not want that to happen. It sounds terrifying. Also I’m not sure it’s effectiveness for focus on adhd. I am inattentive type so my big issue is focus and productivity.

Strattera: chance for liver damage was something I read. That and even on r/adhd it’s very polarizing with a lot of posts saying it’s just the worst med ever. Also allergic reactions? That can happen with all three but I’ve heard them more associated with Strattera. And I’d rather not die from anaphylaxis because I wanted to get a project done.

Vyvanse: my past experience with stimulants, plus some of the heart issues associated with it. Rare side effects include literal death from a heart attack so that’s super cool. On the upside it seems to work well for people?

Until today. 

My beloved fluffy thing broke his leg.  And so for obvious reasons he didn't walk into my room, and didn't fulfill his duty of ""Get the fuck up and brush your teeth Cornflakes"" and so I have been here. In a social media/youtube/netflix spiral and have only just realised the time. 

anywho its late now, but it feels wrong to brush my teeth knowing my cat wont be waiting for me to come back :(

TL;DR My cat alerted me to brush my teeth every night, but hes broken his leg and now cant do it any more. And now it is late and my sleep schedule (ha as if that was a thing) is fucked.

More details on cat injury- He broke his Tibia but not his Fibula (big bone in lower leg but not the little bone) so the vet said to just, leave it be, apparently its a clean break and it will heal itself without intervention. He is cage bound for 6 weeks though (not allowed to jump or run or anything. Jumping to and from my bed would be dangerous for him. When he's a bit better I might move my bed to the floor so he can come cuddle)

780,,ADHD,"... that I don’t personally know and it’s not a crush. I’m hyperfixating hard on a YouTube channel, well, the people that run it. They do livestreams that I watch. Livestreams everyday.

781,,ADHD,"This is long- and hope y’all can follow and bare with me on this one- 

My sister is 17 now and recently just had her first child (she’s doing great by the way, I’m so so proud of her) - She has been diagnosed with ADHD since she was 12, and medicated. After having her baby (about three months later really) When calling her doctor whom has prescribed her medication for the last 7 years, she was told that since she has had a child she could no longer be seen by a pediatrician and needed to find a primary care doctor or a psychiatrist. Well, getting a new patient psychiatrist appointment is already difficult enough and with COVID it’s even more difficult- Earliest appointment isn’t until June in my area, which she is still scheduled for... She then reached out to a primary care doctor and waited two weeks and was able to be seen. She found the time as a new mother to make a doctors appointment, go to it, (which is hard being unmedicated and having ADHD in itself) and ultimately has been left extremely let down. She went to the doctor and explained she’s been on medication for a number of years and couldn’t get into a psychiatrist, but wanted to establish care with someone since her pediatrician would no longer see her. (Physicals, sick visits, exc) and also get back on her ADHD meds until she could get in with the psychiatrist in June. (This particular primary care doctor prescribes my other sister who is 20 her ADHD meds regularly so it’s not like she doesn’t treat ADHD) The doctor told her she would have to take a drug test because her insurance wouldn’t approve her Adderall without one. (Not sure about this, but it came back negative for everything either way) and that once it came back she would send her medication to the pharmacy. Two weeks went by, so she called and asked what was going on, this was to the receptionist, who said her lab work hasn’t come back yet and they would call when it did. One more week goes by, she calls again, the doctor said “your lab results have not come back yet, if you keep calling me than I just won’t prescribe anything at all” this left her super confused and upset. She waited another entire week because she was too scared to call- this is her first time managing her care by herself, so she’s never been in this situation. The doctor said “okay- I will send in something” she sends in- Straterra. My sister was confused because she thought she was waiting on the drug test results- and would be back on the medication that she knew worked for her- and that’s why she had to wait so long. - anyways she ends up taking the Straterra for a month because “she’s just doing what she was told” - this medication made her extremely ill, and I told her she has to call and let this doctor know. She did, the doctor then calls in vyvance- (three days later) which was not covered by her insurance at all. She calls again, and explains the medicine isn’t covered- the doctor said “well I’ll call the pharmacy and double check on that and if that’s the case okay I’ll call something in-“ two days pass, and nothing. She then calls the pharmacy to see if they could possibly call and explain the vyvance wasn’t covered and needed an alternative- the pharmacist called the doctor. The pharmacist then called my sister back and said “I’m not sure what is going on- but the doctor said you need to find someone else to manage your care” she was just... shocked and confused- and in her words “embarrassed” The doctor calls her immediately after the pharmacist did, and tells her the same thing. She asks her if she had something wrong- it was obvious this doctor felt like my sister was “bothering” her. The doctor didn’t have an answer for her. She was just left with zero explanation and has been super upset about the entire situation and is scared to step foot into another doctors office... I have called our local health dept and explained to them what happened. The practice she went too, its a private owned office by one physician (this doctor) so there really is “no higher up” to talk to about what happened to her and how it has effected her. (which is what my local health dept suggested she do) I know she could have just gone to a different doctor, but getting to that appointment and finding a babysitter and setting aside the time is a lot for a single 17yo mom to a newborn, and has never been to the doctors alone for anything like this. Getting to a doctors appointment with ADHD is a struggle within itself, especially unmedicated ADHD. I feel so bad for her, and she feels just overall bad herself since and terrified to go to another doctor. Moral of my story- doctors like this really should not be able to do this to people- people whom are just trying to get well. I wish I could point her in the right direction to assure this won’t happen again- but I know I can’t assure that. I also really wish the doctor could be held accountable for this situation- or ultimately just really know how badly this whole thing has left my sister feeling. I also hope that this doctor doesn’t put other people through this type of thing...why must it be so hard to obtain medication for a something you’re clearly diagnosed with and have been for years and years... doctors really should take into account that people are there to see them to get WELL, not to leave feeling worse than before they walked in their door.",t2_2qrz4fc3,False,,0,False,Wishing I could help my little sister- had her first doctors appointment alone and it has been a complete disaster.,[],r/ADHD,False,0,,0,,,False,t3_m07sey,False,dark,1.0,,public,15,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},HelpingOthers,False,15,,False,self,1615178318.0,,[],{},,True,,1615206608.0,text,0,,,text,self.ADHD,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is long- and hope y’all can follow and bare with me on this one- &lt;/p&gt;

783,,ADHD,"Hi all,

I’ve recently been diagnosed with ADHD and I’ve tried adderall IR, concerta, and now vyvanse. 

- Adderall IR messed with my heart (tachycardia and heart palpitations a few times during the day lasting about 10-20 min at a time) and I would get anxious and depressed when it wears off.

oopsie poopsies.

my meds had already wore out, and i went down stairs to take melatonin. my mom came out so i started talking to her while i took the ""melatonin"". turns out 30 minutes later when i went back upstairs to go to bed,  i saw my focus medicine container sitting on the counter, and the melatonin in the very back of the medicine cabinet. 

""fuck me""

the only time i had taken meds at night was when i was 10. and the only thing i remember was hallucinating and seeing fucking goblins and demons crawling around my desk. i thought i had Schizophrenia.

i got zero sleep (epic) luckily i get up at night alot and the longest ive stayed awake was 2 full days. but it sucks alot more bc i have school today

the reason why i got no sleep wasnt because of the demons crawling on the walls like ghetto spiderman, but instead of a recent phobia that was somewhat caused by adhd meds.  Scelerophobia. (fear of crime.) {just wanna say im having a real hard time keeping my eyes open. feels like shit}

it would go like this. (this is very accurate to what its like. i just sprinkled in some caps, but thats because in my mind it is in caps)

1. look at window for 1 second
2. realize thats long enough for a killer to walk in
3. look at the door way
4. its too dark
5. get up millimeter by millimeter and turn on the closet light
6. look back at window
7. door
8. window
9. door
10. SHIT I FORGOT THE WINDOW!!!!!!
11. Nintendo switch for comfort (dosent work)
12. realize that a serial killer could be anywhere
13. realize theres a FUCKING CLOSET
14. sit up

So I’m finally getting some support which I’m excited about but I’m nervous because I don’t know what the doctor is going to ask me. I’m worried my words won’t come out or my responses won’t be adequate as sometimes I’m not very good at communication and stutter and forget things. 

Could someone please tell me about their experience/ what I should expect?
Also how long did it take for things to start to get better? 
Do certain things need to happen before the doctor offers medication?

799,,ADHD,"Hello

I was diagnosed with ADHD not that long ago, and I have mixed feelings about accepting the diagnosis.

I have just been thinking today about impulsive speech and that I didn't think I really had that issue, however, i was focussing just on shouting over people or blurting out things out over people such as opinions etc instead of just saying inappropriate or impulsive things.

I remember when I was like 14 and I was out with my cousin and a group of his friends who were drinking and im pretty socially anxious, always have been, but i've also always been known as the ""weird one"" in my big family lol, just because of the stuff i say or talk about sometimes i guess. So when I was like 14 I ended up saying some random stupid comment about how a kids genitals look like two tangerine segments, and everyone thought i was weird as fuck (and i know it is, but i just said it because i thought it would be funny idk) and even till this day over 10 years ago I think back and im like what the fuck is wrong with me fuckin weirdo freak who says that???

A different time a family member was taunting me and i was getting annoyed, and he would just not leave me along, like i think he was kicking me over and over. he was enlisting for the army and i said something akin to ""i hope you join the army and die in afghanistan"" or something, again, something which causes me to feel dread these days for saying something so mean and horrible in the moment.

at a job i had in my teens i randomly said something like ""dont you ever just go onto google and search something like i hate myself and i want to die and just read through what other people have searched?""(i actually spend loads of time searching random thoughts into the internet in first person to see if anyone has experienced this and reading through reddit post, idk anyone else who does this) and everyone thought i was weird as hell man honestly. Like among my friends they all think im cool and open and funny wwith a weird sense of humour, but to people i dont know i always feel so restricted and closed off and my voice goes hella monotone and i just express with my hands and i cant even make my voice louder and when i do talk im fuckin weird lol. i wonder if this is a learnt behaviour because of saying weird stuff and feeling like im such a weirdo

I recently got my dream job but every day is a battle with adhd that I always lose and I’m lucky that no one else at work has noticed it because I should probably be fired by now. 

It used to be better when I could go take my computer to a library or cafe or the office and be in an environment that encouraged me to be productive but working from home is so difficult, and I live alone so there’s no one I can ask to help pull me out when I get stuck in my head. 

I’ve been on Concerta/Ritalin for a few years now although since the pandemic I’ve been barely taking them because they tend to exacerbate my “ODC tendencies” (my psychologist’s words) and when I’m home alone there’s nothing I can do to stop myself. Not only that but I notice myself getting super anxious as well. I’ve been gradually reducing my medication dose and switched to Ritalin so I could control it better but I have a 10mg dose and taking half a tablet can feel like too much. Maybe methylphenidate is not for me, it worked the best when I had an intense schedule (go to work in the morning then go to school, hw and studying and doing extra work until nighttime, I was getting less than 5 hours of sleep every night and my depression spiraled but I remember the medication being helpful to adhd)

I’m so lost on what to do. My psychiatrist is one of those doctors that’s like “ok tell me what you want” instead of helping to suggest medications and doses and I hate it but it’s so hard to find psychiatrists where I live, he was the only doctor when I was first looking that would accept new patients and it took me months to get an appointment with him.

I’ve tried Adderall and for some reason I felt absolutely no difference when I took it. this was years ago so many I should try again? I also was thinking to try Vyvanse but I’ve heard anxiety is a common side effect of it so I’m not sure that would be better. I really don’t know what else to do. I tried to take a 10mg Ritalin today and I just felt sensory overload all day.

&lt;p&gt;So I hope this isn’t TMI, but since I can remember I’ve always used sexual to fall asleep at night. My mind is always darting all over the place, and I think sexual fantasies are enticing enough that my mind is able to remain focused upon them until i fall asleep. However over the last year or so those fantasies just excite me too much and I can’t get to sleep, so I end up laying in bed for hours on end each night. Does anyone have any advice for me regarding how I can help my ADHD brain fall asleep faster? Whether it’s things to think about, bedtime rituals, or anything else! I would really appreciate the help :) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the best!&lt;/p&gt;

811,,ADHD,"I don’t know if there’s a point to all this, I just want to get it off my chest because I feel awful about it and don’t have anyone IRL to talk to about this. 

The last year was really weird for me. I think I was majorly depressed, and I don’t know why exactly. There has been a lot of changes - aside from a totally new structure due to covid and the restrictions, I also started going back to college (I’m 28 now), and got into a new relationship, all around the same time one year ago. I think right now I’m coming out of this really bad phase, and to look back and see how much I fucked up is scary.

I stopped talking to all my friends around this time last year. It wasn’t because I felt like I didn’t need them anymore, I missed my best friends a lot, but I was feeling so overwhelmed about the new relationship. I lied to my girlfriend about meeting friends and stuff, to get alone time. She wouldn’t have mind at all, she was actually encouraging me, it just felt like I couldn’t get on top of organizing my life and needed so much alone time to just “be”. 

In the beginning my friends would reach out and then often instead of just replying I would postpone responding, because I was afraid that this meant I had to be fully there again and I felt like I couldn’t keep up. I kept waiting for everything to be perfect with university, with work, my relationship, and THEN I would reach out. Of course it never happened. I skipped some online classes, then got too nervous to join again and just ignored that. Every night I had nightmares about my friends, I was feeling paranoid when outside, worried of running into anyone before I had the chance to make it up to them. 

In summer group projects at college started and after missing two meetings I just disappeared because I had no good enough excuse for not attending, and then I was so worried that they would check in with me that I actually deleted all messenger apps and kind of just ghosted everyone in my life, and did nothing for university. I took one exam in two semesters, which is a huge waste of money and I didn’t even feel like I had more time or anything, I was constantly feeling guilty, stressed out and anxious to no end. 

Yet, despite having NOTHING going on in my life except for work and my girlfriend, I didn’t get in touch with my friends. I didn’t explain my behavior. There were serious illnesses in my family, and I didn’t reach out, I just kept postponing. The only people I was in touch with were my parents (the minimum amount!) and my girlfriend. I was really lonely, but I just couldn’t stop this horrible behavior. Whenever I gathered the energy to call, I started overthinking it to the point where I finally came to the conclusion it would be better not to do it. Then at night I had nightmares about it again. 

Last week was my birthday and I spent it with my girlfriend. Obviously no one reached out to congratulate me - even if they did, I wouldn’t have seen it since I deleted all messenger apps anyway. 

I think my girlfriend noticed and we had a huge fight about it until I was having a panic attack and didn’t stop crying for hours. She doesn’t know how bad everything is, because I don’t seem so depressed. I go to work, I hide my anxiety, I make jokes about wanting to die but who doesn’t, and she’s really bad at dealing with mental health issues anyway. She doesn’t know about adhd or executive disorder, and she doesn’t inform herself about it. She’s the kind of person who thinks you just have to work harder, behave better and be more disciplined. Definitely team “tough love”, which I’m not sure I like but I think I don’t  have the confidence or self esteem to verbalize it properly or set boundaries, so I’m always worried about her reactions and feel attacked about everything.

Anyway, she said I was a shitty friend, that she wouldn’t forgive me if she was my friend, and that there’s no excuse for my behavior. I agree. I think I let my friends down completely, I’m a piece of shit, but at the same time it’s easier to say this now that I feel more normal - I know this was a crazy big task when I was more down and lethargic before. 

Today I attended the first online lecture of the semester. It’s the first one in months I’ve attended. I told myself that just because I’m scared of my former group members, I shouldn’t skip my education out of fear etc. I didn’t know the code to the meeting, and neither did the students office so I had to install a messenger app and reach out to a student, ask him to add me to the group again and give me the information I needed. I did that but I was really nervous. I saw that I had been kicked out of my workgroups, and I think I have to apologize to the members because it’s a small university and I’m seeing them all the time (online), and I was already freaking out when the professor made us go to breakout groups, because I didn’t know how to face those people. One of them actually was in my former group but we didn’t talk about anything personal, of course. 

I also reached out to one of my best friends. I had already talked to her a few weeks ago where I learned that a lot of shit had happened to her in the last year, which I had totally missed due to my complete absence. We had some superficial talks since then but I felt like she was very distant which stressed me out, and I didn’t know how to address it. Today I apologized again and she was very honest and open, told me that she is always nervous I will abandon her again and how I seem to disappear when I’m in a new relationship. We talked about it for a long time, I assured her she was right about what she was feeling, I didn’t make excuses but told her what was going on, and she said she is still a bit cautious and thinks I was unfair and hurt her. She said she doesn’t want to hold a grudge and she wants to be friends again but we’ll see, I guess. I promised I wouldn’t disappear again but of course she can’t just trust me so I guess I have to prove it to her over time.


I have two more friends and more family members I urgently need to reach out to, but I don’t know how and what to say. I can’t be that open to my family about it and I’m sure they’re a lot more angry than my friend. This friend I talked to had been my very close, best friend for years, so I feel like everyone else doesn’t even want to listen to me. I think I owe them all an apology, without expecting them to want to be friends again, but my stomach hurts just thinking about it.

And my biggest problem is that I just don’t know how to never make this happen again because while it’s never been going on for so long, it’s definitely not the first time this has happened. Sometimes I’m so overwhelmed with social life, and everything In General gets too much. I wonder if I should just not have friends and relationships because I’m hurting people and I’m not cut out for it. Even though I’m a fairly social person, ironically, and get lonely quickly.

820,,ADHD,"Shortly after having my son, I started experiencing frequent panic attacks with difficulties breathing and tears and frustration as I'd never had panic attacks that sever. After a few months, I went to my GP, was diagnosed with anxiety and put on Cymbalta. A few months later, and a few dosage changes later, I felt like I was in the clouds, and I had no cares or worries at all, especially regarding work. So, after about 9 months, I quit cold turkey 

A few years later, I start to really feel down after some personal tragedies and got back to the doctor and decided to give a go again at medications to help. Only thing is this time, I was depressed. So, I tried Prozac, Lexapro and Wellbutrin with the same results: it works for a few months, but doesn't work long term. 

So, my psych puts me on Effexor, and it seemed to work, until it didn't. Then, I got prescribed Abilify to help with the depression, but I continued to have days where I could not get out of bed, and the panic attacks never went away. 

Finally, this January, we discussed the possibility of me having ADHD. I was prescribed Ritalin, and upon my first dose, I suddenly felt this weight in the front of my head. It was like something was bringing my head down and I could think clearly. I could think. 

Now, this has not been a miracle drug that has taken away all my problems, but for the first time in 9 years, I can handle things. I don't feel overwhelmed, and I don't lack any care at all. 

This was all to preface the absolute shit show that was my weekend. My cat was put into 48 hours emergency vet watch for bladder crystals, I suspect I have a friend with a pill addiction that required over 4 hours of conversations on how we're going to address this, my dogs got into a fight and tore open the other's skin that is definitely going to require stitches, and I have to stay up until midnight to administer the pain medication to my cat when I'd normally be asleep at 9pm. I'm exhausted, I'm emotionally drained, but something that would have normally had me in a corner crying and in an absolute state of panic all seems manageable. It's as if my brain is compartmentalizing all of the things that I have to do now, and is processing all the things I had to go through this weekend. 

I don't even know where else to go with this revelation, but I just feel like a weight has been lifted off of me in that every little problem doesn't have me pulling up the covers avoiding life for fear of my to do list. I don't sit and procrastinate doing anything else but what work I need to get done. It's as if I wasted 9 years being a guinea pig trying not all off the wrong meds so that I could get to this point of clarity and acceptance. 

I don't feel as if I'm relaying my true emotions in this post, but I feel I needed to share somewhere. I felt like I need to hear someone else went through this journey as well? I want to know that I'm not the only one to struggle with the weight of anxiety and depression when all along it was ADHD and my inability to process appropriately.

Let me delve into this a bit deeper and explain how my brain works...
So this is something I’ve been having a tough time with all my life, I’m fully aware I do these things but I CANNOT stop my mind ticking wildly. I find a new hobby or a new subject or a new movie saga or franchise and I OBSESS! I’m 25, almost 26 and my most recent obsession is subscription boxer shorts 🤦🏻‍♂️, my last obsession was powdered energy drinks. I find something I like and my brain wants as much of it as I can get. I used to collect lightsabers and pop vinyls and then one day my mind is clear and I no longer want them. I sell up. I find something else I invest my everything into and then I just one day no longer care. I built my own pc and I was obsessed with making it look pretty and putting rgb everywhere, then my friend got a gaming laptop and I’ve needed a laptop for work, so I sold my pride and joy pc and bought a gaming laptop. It’s tiring. I was getting something delivered and cause it didn’t come next day like it was supposed to, I phoned the courier over 15 times on different days to try and get it sooner even though every time I rang, they told me it won’t be possible.

I’m currently taking sertraline for my depression, I lost my brother to suicide and I don’t have a great relationship with my family cause I think they didn’t understand me growing up. I’m quite bright and I always have been as I focus so hard at certain things but I throw it away cause I lose focus eventually. I often get called a wind up, because I can be a handful, but its because I bounce off the walls sometimes. 

I’m irrational when it comes to spending money. I buy things I know I don’t want or need, just to complete the set when I own a part of it, and I’m so satisfied once I’ve got it all, or more so when I almost have it all. Then once I have it, I just don’t care anymore.

I’ve been told it’s called hyper focus and it’s a symptom of ADHD-PI but I just need to know what is making me crazy.

834,,ADHD,"Dr. Andrew Huberman is a professor at Stanford, his podcast Huberman Lab is amazing. 10/10 recommend.

He referenced a study done on sleep and performance. Turns out, consistently getting ~about~ the same amount of sleep each night is better than striving for this magical 8 hours (which apparently is kinda bullshit)

So if you sleep for 4 hours, 6 hours, 5 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours... that will be better for you than if you were to sleep 4 hours, 9 hours, 5 hours, 8 hours, 10 hours. I hope that makes sense. 

The most comforting thing is - don’t worry about following a set of rules when it comes to sleeping. If it works for you, you’re probably doing the right thing (even if it’s not the magic number)

So if you stress about “getting enough sleep”, try to be consistent with whatever amount of time you usually get.

HOW?!?! It was in her bag. I saw it! 

Oh well, I chat with my friend for a couple of minutes and then head back to pick up her lunchbox and...the phone rings. It's the school wondering where I am. IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME! I wasted the whole morning with my friend! I grab the lunchbox (it was under a pile of books) and head to the school.

She gets her lunch ten minutes late and every is fine.

841,,ADHD,"A colleague forwarded me [this article](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/03/what-pandemic-doing-our-brains/618221/) about ""Pandemic Brain"" and I just found it to be heartbreaking and ironically amusing. For example, here's a description of what the author is experiencing:

&gt; Sometimes I grasp at a word or a name. Sometimes I walk into the kitchen and find myself bewildered as to why I am there. (At one point during the writing of this article, I absentmindedly cleaned my glasses with nail-polish remover.) Other times, the forgetting feels like someone is taking a chisel to the bedrock of my brain, prying everything loose. 

It's like: Yeah.  That's me ALL THE TIME.  That was me on my BEST days BEFORE the pandemic.

Another quote:

&gt; Everywhere I turn, the fog of forgetting has crept in. A friend of mine recently confessed that the morning routine he’d comfortably maintained for a decade—wake up before 7, shower, dress, get on the subway—now feels unimaginable on a literal level: He cannot put himself back there. 

Again, me, every single day BEFORE the pandemic.

One more:

&gt; Jen George, a community-college teacher from Cape Elizabeth, Maine, told me she is losing her train of thought in the middle of a sentence more and more often. Meanwhile, her third grader, who is attending in-person school, keeps leaving his books, papers, and lunch at home. Inny Ekeolu, a 19-year-old student from Ireland, says she has found herself forgetting how to do things she used to do on a regular basis: swiping her bus pass, paying for groceries.  

Argh! This is me functioning normally!  


But, it's not all doom and gloom.  I am THRILLED at the notion of finally being able to adequately explain how my brain works to neurotypicals after the pandemic is done.  *""Hey, do you remember how trying to do everyday normal things during the pandemic were so hard, and it felt like being in a fog all the time?

A friend of mine recently confessed that the morning routine he’d comfortably maintained for a decade—wake up before 7, shower, dress, get on the subway—now feels unimaginable on a literal level: He cannot put himself back there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, me, every single day BEFORE the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One more:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jen George, a community-college teacher from Cape Elizabeth, Maine, told me she is losing her train of thought in the middle of a sentence more and more often. Meanwhile, her third grader, who is attending in-person school, keeps leaving his books, papers, and lunch at home. Inny Ekeolu, a 19-year-old student from Ireland, says she has found herself forgetting how to do things she used to do on a regular basis: swiping her bus pass, paying for groceries.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Argh! This is me functioning normally!  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, it&amp;#39;s not all doom and gloom.  I am THRILLED at the notion of finally being able to adequately explain how my brain works to neurotypicals after the pandemic is done.  &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Hey, do you remember how trying to do everyday normal things during the pandemic were so hard, and it felt like being in a fog all the time?  Well, have I got news for you.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR Pandemic brain is just normies getting a taste of life with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;

Let me tell you why. 

Achieving goals requires consistency. But consistency is boring.

It’s boring because you have to do the same thing over and over. For example, you want to learn to cook. 
You have to be CONSISTENT. You have to cook every week. You have to cook the same time to master it. 

But BORING is the death of us. The second we are bored with something, we move on to the next goal.

847,,ADHD,"As the title says, I thought I'd share some of my skills I have learned over the years that help mitigate some of my adhd symptoms. I am aware that everyone experiences the symptoms of this disease differently, so I will add that these tips may not be for everyone, but I figured they may help some.

\- Eat a high-protein breakfast as soon as you can in the morning. This has some scientific backing that you can research, but essentially it sets your brain up for good performance. Eggs, meat, protein bars, etc. are all things that have helped me feel more mentally prepared during the early hours of the day. 

\- To help cut down on ""time-blindness"" related shenanigans, I started playing a game where I try to guess the time before each time that I check a clock. I've always been surprised just how bad I was at predicting the amount of time some tasks take, but after doing this trick for a bit it has gotten a little better for me. 

\- Put your overactive imaginations to work! I have always had an overactive imagination, running so constantly and vividly that it sometimes is the main cause of my distractions. I'm sure some of you have experience in this. I've had some success generating interest in dull tasks and work-related things by just simply imagining it being more interesting. I know this sounds childish, but who cares if it works right?

\- Caffeine is more helpful by itself than it is with all of the sugar and add-ins from energy drinks and supplements. Caffeine consumed as stand-alone pills can be pretty effective at helping to maintain focus and clarity without too many side effects (watch your intake, no more than 2-3 200mg pills spaced out over a day for most people). Energy drinks can be great for improving alertness and boosting energy, but I have always found they actually reduce my ability to focus. This is not the case with coffee, tea, and other things that have caffeine without all the add-ins (such as taurine, insane amounts of b-vitamins, etc.). 

\- Make removing clutter a high priority. Clutter is a way of life for a lot of us, but trying to mitigate symptoms while surrounded by unfinished obligations causes sensory overload for me. Speaking for myself, when I enter a room in my house I literally notice and am fully aware of all the visible clutter in the room. I've realized that this takes up valuable resources in my brain that could be better spent on other things. I notice that I have an easier time managing symptoms when I have eliminated the clutter. As for the motivation to get it done, the best time for me is on a day off, immediately after breakfast, coffee, and medicine. 

\- More frequent short breaks are better than fewer long breaks. I feel like my brain works on a shorter time scale than others. Anticipating a 30 minute break that is 4 hrs into my shift is distant enough into the future that it is almost abstract in my awareness. Taking a 5 minute break every hour keeps me focused and refreshed and I have an easier time staying aware of what I can do within that hour before a quick break. 

\- You don't need a bullet journal, you just need a notebook with page numbers and an index. This is essentially what a bullet journal is, but don't bother with all the other stuff that people swear you need (calendars, habit trackers, etc.) you just need a place where you can write notes and be able to find it easy for later. If you already have a system that works for you that is great, but I find with a lot of adhd people that adding all the extras that require consistency are just adding more things to keep track of that really aren't that helpful. They also just add more things to procrastinate on which can lower your mood. Keep it simple and don't create more obligations in an attempt to help keep track of your current obligations.

850,,ADHD,"I can’t explain it to anyone. Not in a way they’d understand. I’m venting, because it hurts, knowing my career is destroyed, my life in ruins, all because of this fucking condition, despite all the medication.

My ADHD never interfered with my learning, because I’d get everything done before I lost interest. For my entire life, I was the first one done with exams. I’d usually ace them too. I took the LSAT after maybe studying it for an hour, about the most I could manage. I got a 166.

I graduated a top 20 law school in the top 20% of my class.

And I am a failure.

In the past five years since graduating, I have been fired from 3 jobs for performance issues, all from 2017-2018. I had to run around doing social security disability hearings on a contract basis for a year and a half, before getting a job as general counsel for a small company (hence my name) before that too ended in January. They said my performance wasn’t an issue and it was just that they took on in-house too early. Maybe, but, in my head, I wonder otherwise, although I never did get a complaint.

I regularly get fleeting suicidal thoughts because of how frustrated and despondent I am about my career. All my life, everyone said I’d do great. Instead, I’m a fucking bum. I won’t hurt myself, I’m devoutly Catholic, couldn’t do it, also I know people love me.

It’s impossible to explain to people. They say “You’ll bounce back”. What suggests I will bounce back? I fucking can’t keep a job.

I have a great doc who truly cares, and we are changing my medications. But I don’t think it will matter. I’ve been medicated since the first grade. I take it every day. It made no difference at my job.

I feel robbed. I feel like I got the ultimate screw. To be good throughout school, and then to fail when it matters. I wish I wasn’t smart at all. At least I’d have no expectations.

853,,ADHD,"A month or two ago I really got the idea that I could have un-diagnosed ADHD. Basically looking into how it presents in adults, looking at threads here of other folks experience and having constant ""oh my god, that's exactly what I'm like"" reactions, etc.

My story, why I think I have ADHD:

* emotional / short-fuse as a kid
* As a young child I heard stories of me running out of class to go have recess when it wasn't time, but I don't remember it.
* Had major problems rambling and people think I was annoying
* Throughout elementary school teachers always giving the feedback that I'm doing well, but daydreaming all the time
* Later elementary school once we had our first ""long-term"" projects (rather than just daily assignments) is when I started to have a hard time. Had one that my Mom essentially did in 5th grade because I put it off to the last minute, another in 6th grade that I failed but hid the report card from my parents so they never found out.
* Always pacing during conversations, can't sit still
* Jr. high I got good grades but continuing the trend of assignments all being completed last minute when the urgency kicks in. Lost a letter grade in Science even though I did well on the tests because our teacher required them to be taken home to be signed by parent
* High school always running late, trouble getting assignments in on time, didn't take study halls because I couldn't use the time appropriately anyways. Got everything done super quick last minute anyways.
* Had a teacher organize their seating chart based solely on where I was sitting relative to my friends (because I talked so much during class)
* Fell asleep during ACT's but still got good enough grades to go to state school
* In college same thing...just got everything done last minute. But it seems like everyone did that??? I don't know...
* A lot of anxiety / depression because I feel like I'm not reaching my potential because I'm lazy / unmotivated
* Now I've been working for 6 years at a company that has a culture of very little oversight and a ton of meetings. I don't have a problem attending meetings because I just multi-task if it's boring and walk around the house. Outside of attending meetings and responding to emails if I have any independent work it often takes me days / weeks to build up the motivation to do a couple hours of work. On average I probably do only about 30 minutes to 1 hour of independent work per day

The ""problem"" is that I've been successful in my job but I feel super trapped. Like I've found this niche situation where I'm being paid decently, have a great manager, great work-life balance, but I feel horrible because I feel like I'm doing 1/10th of what I could be doing if I could just work 8 hours a day.

Had a meeting with a new therapist yesterday and we just went down the rabbit hole of talking about my job. She didn't say it, but I got the vibe that she didn't really think I had ADHD, and was just going on about ""what are your goals"", ""I think your job is just too easy and you're bored"", ""you're unmotivated because you don't have accountability"", etc......

I don't know....maybe I'm overreacting, but I just feel like I needed some validation that's like ""yup, it sounds like you have ADHD""....and I didn't get that. I know the things that she's saying are probably helpful whether I get the diagnosis or not....but it just has me second guessing things.

What's your take?

854,,ADHD,"I (23F) just got my official diagnosis &amp; i’m not sure how to feel. I had to advocate for myself to even get tested and I’ve known for months now that I have adhd so I thought I’d feel so relieved or happy or excited or anything like that but now that I finally have that little check mark on my file in some computer system next to adhd I just kind of feel.. numb? Like it isn’t real or that if I move too quickly it’ll disappear? Is that a normal reaction?? I thought at the least I’d cry just because now I finally understand why I couldn’t keep up with my peers and i’m not actually stupid and know why after years of treatment for other mental illnesses i’m still not getting better but nope, i’m just sitting here blank faced and empty

858,,ADHD,"Sorry this is so long, maybe there's someone out there who will read this and I can connect with. Im overwhelmed and here's my verbal diarrhea. 

Always thought ADHD was the kid bouncing off the walls who couldn't sit still and that wasn't me. This community has opened my eyes and resonating with me a lot.

Organizing my life and doing all the ""normal"" things is so overwhelming to me. I never remember what I'm forgetting or not doing. The weight of always being behind on things, having forgotten things, being disorganized, is constant. And I don't even remember what all the things are I am behind on or need to do. 

If my bills aren't on autopay they don't get paid. Forgetting to pay my bills has impacted my credit score even though I have plenty of money.

I've shown up to cities on the wrong day, airports on the wrong hours, shown up to job interviews and realized I forgot half my suit, and just feel like I can't keep things straight or remember them right. 

My company doesn't understand why I can't submit my timesheets on time like everyone else, or why I can't prepare and submit my expense claims on time. It's gotten really bad and I'm known as the ""special case"". They tolerate it because I'm exceptional at what I do when I can focus. 

In university, lectures were such a slow pace and so boring. One time I missed my entire semester of classes because the first lecture was moving way too slow, then forgot I was even enrolled in the class. At the end of the semester I saw my exam of the course I forgot on my schedule two days before the test. I crashed the entire course in two days of hyperfocus before the exam and got the highest mark in the class (final exam was 100% of the grade if you missed the midterm).

I know I'm smart and it has gotten me by and on the outside it seems I'm thriving in many aspects. I've been promoted early for everything and seen as an overachiever. I've been at my job for 10 years but bounced around from division and function every couple years maximum. I change my work location every couple hours, and can't sit at a desk for a 9-5. I change where I live often and jetset around the world. 

I struggle so hard to get up in the mornings. I didn't know that was associated with ADHD. I sleep in until the last minute or miss things. In grade 10 I spent a semester unable to get out of bed on Mondays until the afternoons and would miss my mornings of school. 

I honestly can't remember what I can't remember as to all the reasons I think maybe I could have ADHD.

Last week I tried Adderall for the first time to see what effect it would have (not via prescription). I was able to sit for HOURS and work. I got things done I had been putting off for MONTHS. But I also felt like a zombie and not myself. 

I'm overwhelmed. What if I have ADHD? And now that I've thought maybe I do and it could explain so much in my life, what if I don't??? I'm almost more scared I dont have it. 

I'm trying to get myself to go through the diagnosis process now but it's hard. I have to try and organize my benefits package, sign up for their online portal, figure out how to contact their services, etc. I spent some time today then gave up.

&lt;p&gt;So it got me thinking, and then I spiraled into a thought pattern of “wow, maybe I’m not really original.” I’ve been trying to ignore the feeling since but I can’t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone else ever feel this way?&lt;/p&gt;

878,,ADHD,"Hello I'm 26F. I was diagnosed not even a year ago but suspected it a while before. There were signs, seems obvious now. This means I suddenly recognise some patterns in other people.

**My mother has undiagnosed ADHD, I am sure of this.**

She went through a rough time when I came around due to other reasons and was under stress.

Growing up:

1.There's unread bills and papers everywhere. We always had cereal and other crap for dinner in front of the TV (3 times a week tops I'd say bc my grandparents were involved otherwise). 

2.We had a bedroom in our house we couldn't use because it was so filled with unused furniture and papers and so much stuff that she never got to. We had to climb if we needed something (wasn't dirty, it was just many things)

3.I had a backlog of vaccinations to get. I had to get 3 at once, one time, because they were past due and the school wouldn't let me enroll otherwise (no she's not anti Vax, she's just overwhelmed when there's things to get done). I never got the HPV vaccine for the same reasons even though it was free.

4. Mood swings, so much accumulated frustration. It got worse when I became an ADHD teenager of course and there were a lot of fights.

5. She always got into projects at home and then had a couple accidents. Eg. Decided to paint the cupboards and accidentally ended up glueing her forehead to the cabinets. Dropped the ladder and went to pick it up without noticing glass shards, needed many many stitches, there was so much blood. And many other things.

6. After moving out I had to go to her place and she didn't want me to. I found out its because it was an incredible mess. She is amazing at cleaning up the day before, it looks like there was never any mess. But you can't ever go unannounced...

7. She has this compulsion to say she'll help and then the time comes and she doesn't do the things she said she would, and she's the one who offered.

8. We were late to everything. I was always late to school, she often was late to pick me up. Lateness is a main thing in my life and her life and it's impossible to correct at this point.

Did you guys notice the same in your parents?

I wish she were diagnosed so she could have recognized it in me instead of not knowing how to parent and me being a ""bad child"" and demonized for leaving a wet towel on my bed and not tidying my room enough. There were SO many fights. Nobody got how or why it was difficult for me to remember the dishes.
