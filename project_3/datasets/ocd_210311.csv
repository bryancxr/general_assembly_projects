9,,OCD,"Lately I've been feeling really bad about things I've said or done in the past. I'll ruminate for days about one thing, and when I finally get past it, I'll start ruminating about something else, and eventually I end up ruminating about the first thing again. Some of the things I feel guilty about are trivial. Some are a bit worse, but I've never done anything illegal. Regardless of whether it's something extremely trivial or not though, the anxiety that comes with it is basically the same for each mistake. I worry that the people I've wronged still think about what I did or said, even though they probably don't, because like I said, some of the stuff I think about is very trivial, and most of it occurred years ago. I also worry that I might bump into someone who is associated with one of these events and have to endure them scolding me (but I feel like I deserve it).

I worry that the people I&amp;#39;ve wronged still think about what I did or said, even though they probably don&amp;#39;t, because like I said, some of the stuff I think about is very trivial, and most of it occurred years ago.

But the reason I’m worrying is my parents said earlier today if a man becomes hard he likes whatever’s going on.

41,,OCD,"cross-posted to r/ROCD

I always feel so abnormal/creepy/like a freak when I discuss how I feel sexual arousal. I cannot watch porn of strangers, and have a general dislike of pornography, even soft core romance scenes in regular films ""squick"" me out (personal term for feeling of intense discomfort). I also do not fantasize or have crushes on random people (Actors/Famous Sorts/Unnattained People). If there's no romantic/emotional investment or experience, I'm the sahara desert.

So basically I have been in a tumultuous 3 year long hell with an extremely abusive ex (lying, compulsive stealing, alcohol/addiction issues, cheating, ghosting, fake apologies, etc.).

When I first met him I thought it was a dream come true, and quickly realized it was too good to be true and that he was a complete fraud. The problem was I've never felt as intense a sexual connection with anyone else.

Even though he treats me like trash (""Step right up! Get your hot garbage!"") I still fantasize about him when I masturbate, compulsively. I try to forcibly visualize something or someone else or a different ex partner, but it doesn't work. When I try to abstain and deny myself self-pleasuring (extremely difficult, my libido is extremely high and a psychiatrist early on said that I had hypersexuality) I start getting intrusive thoughts of him and I having sex which I can see visually even with my eyes open. When I get those thoughts I also have a physical reaction that I cannot control, my vagina spasms, I get taps and presses and pokes all over my body. I feel basically like his ghost is touching me, having it's way. I moan inappropriately by accident when it occurs. It happens in public and I am SO EMBARASSED about it all the time.

I've always been an obsessive romantic since an early age, only have eyes for one and all that, and it takes me ages to get over finally finding someone attractive, but I've never been attached to the thought of someone who was so horrible to me. I know better, it's not healthy. I feel like an addict that just can't stop. I literally let this guy walk all over me just for a chance to sate my libido with him.

Does anyone else here have this problem? Does anyone have any advice?

Dating right now really doesn't work and I can't even find a single other person to obsess over instead because that's usually the only way I've ever gotten over someone from my past.

43,,OCD,"I think it’s kind of an extension of moral OCD which has been one of the most prevalent themes for me for a while now. I watched pornography a lot growing up and I feel as if to some degree it shaped my perception of women in an unhealthy way for a while. I don’t really watch it anymore, and I’ve since begun to recognise and challenge these ‘ways of seeing’ in an attempt to better myself.


Nothing too extreme, but I mean this as in things like “seeing a woman’s body as inherently sexual”. I know there’s of course nothing wrong with being attracted to someone’s body, I guess you can’t help it, but I feel like for a while my view was automatically skewed in that direction sometimes, which I feel was unhealthy. I’ve noticed there’s still some part of me that immediately views it from a primarily attraction-based point of view whenever I see a girl who I may find attractive. As in like the primary thought is about whatever it is I find attractive about them as opposed to anything else. Of course, I realise this is bad and counter it whenever it happens, but still.


The problem is that I still have a constant impulse towards sexual fantasy. This is where the moral OCD comes in, I think. Because, month after month, no matter how much I feel bad about it, I always end up giving in to imagining stuff like that. I know fantasy is a normal part of sexuality - however, the stuff I imagine is of course reflective of stuff I’ve watched in the past to some degree. Not entirely, because I find a lot of porn kind of creepy/gross in retrospect, but it’s definitely still that kind of thing.


The problem there is that, if this harmful shitty prejudice I had (or maybe still have to some degree even if I know it’s wrong, I don’t know) was partially shaped by watching that kind of thing, surely imagining stuff that’s basically the same at a similar frequency would have the same effect? There’s the possibility that acknowledging these things and having the ability to therefore not let them influence my worldview is a thing, but I’m not entirely convinced. It’s frustrating in that aspect because I’m sure to some degree it’s OCD but it’s entirely plausible for there to be a measure of truth to it, and I don’t want to just go and move on with my life if I don’t ‘deserve’ to, if that makes any sense.


So it leads to this constant cycle of me not being able to help but give in to thinking about it sometimes (still not entirely convinced it’s not just me being a prick who doesn’t want to try hard enough, but that itself could just be an expression of the OCD), doing it, and then inevitably feeling awful about it afterwards. Often stuff I was okay with at the time of thinking about it feels kind of creepy or weird or not to my taste afterward, which heightens this (again, nothing extreme at all or actually particularly weird, so probably just an OCD overreaction as well, but, just kind of saying that it happens). So if I am doing something bad I’d at least like to be sure about it! But there’s no real way to be, and I don’t want to give into OCD if that’s what it is.",t2_5p0dhob6,False,,0,False,Sexual OCD,[],r/OCD,False,0,,0,,False,t3_m2581t,False,light,1.0,,public,4,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Question,False,4,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1615431011.0,text,0,,,text,self.OCD,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it’s kind of an extension of moral OCD which has been one of the most prevalent themes for me for a while now. I watched pornography a lot growing up and I feel as if to some degree it shaped my perception of women in an unhealthy way for a while. I don’t really watch it anymore, and I’ve since begun to recognise and challenge these ‘ways of seeing’ in an attempt to better myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing too extreme, but I mean this as in things like “seeing a woman’s body as inherently sexual”. I know there’s of course nothing wrong with being attracted to someone’s body, I guess you can’t help it, but I feel like for a while my view was automatically skewed in that direction sometimes, which I feel was unhealthy. I’ve noticed there’s still some part of me that immediately views it from a primarily attraction-based point of view whenever I see a girl who I may find attractive. As in like the primary thought is about whatever it is I find attractive about them as opposed to anything else. Of course, I realise this is bad and counter it whenever it happens, but still.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that I still have a constant impulse towards sexual fantasy. This is where the moral OCD comes in, I think. Because, month after month, no matter how much I feel bad about it, I always end up giving in to imagining stuff like that. I know fantasy is a normal part of sexuality - however, the stuff I imagine is of course reflective of stuff I’ve watched in the past to some degree. Not entirely, because I find a lot of porn kind of creepy/gross in retrospect, but it’s definitely still that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;

65,,OCD,"There’s an ongoing conversation in all of our heads. Two voices, going back and forth.

It’s important to watch how we talk to ourselves, but what’s more important is the awareness that you’re always talking to yourself.

There’s you, the one who has always been there, observing every happening of your life and there’s this crazy roommate. He’s been with us for as long as we can remember, ranting and raving and rarely useful.

As he rides along on your way to work, he turns and starts to smile – Did you turn the oven off?

This crazy roommate is wreaking havoc on our peace of mind. The mistake a lot of us make is trying to appease a madman. We think that if we just go back and check to make sure the oven is off, then he’ll be quiet.

We’ve identified this roommate as crazy. But the dangerous thing is that we’re consulting them as we go through our day.

## Be the Observer

Remove yourself from the conversation and just watch. You don’t have to be either voice in there. You can be an observer who notices the madness going back and forth.

We know we don’t have superpowers, but we try using our mind to bend the world to our reality. We wrongly believe that a certain amount of worrying or obsessively imagining an outcome is going to impact it.

The closest thing to a superpower available to us is the power to separate life into two categories – what we can control and what we can’t. The power comes from being able to let go of what we can’t and channel our energy into what we can.

You will slip and your mind will run wild. You will catch yourself making the mistake of thinking you can worry the world your way.

Watching our mind is a practice. It’s not all or nothing. Just because you can’t do it perfectly 100% of the time doesn’t mean the alternative is 0% of the time.

The more you practice, the quicker you’ll notice your mind running off. You’ll notice it trying to control the uncontrollable and you stop. Then you channel your focus away from the madness and back to what you can control. Back to the present moment. You’re able to focus on what you’re doing and you’re not lost in your thoughts.

The happy life is the one where we put all our effort into the things we can control. We don’t waste time – which is what our life is – on fooling ourselves into believing we can control the uncontrollable.

**Ditch the Roommate**

Think about that voice, that crazy roommate. Why do we keep taking advice from them? If they were an actual person we’d run away. Our parents and friends would be concerned about us spending time together.

If this was a real person, we’d be cognizant of how they’re impacting our environment. Real or not real, they *are* impacting our environment. That conversation *is* happening. The quality of that conversation, which is a conversation with yourself, is your environment.

You definitely wouldn’t let this person contribute to your most important life decisions. You wouldn’t trust them to tell you who to marry or what career pursuits were worthy.

This wild roommate is really the primal part of our brains. Sometimes called the monkey brain. It doesn’t fit the times. It’s still on the lookout for lions as we walk down the aisle of the supermarket. And when it doesn’t find these dangers, that it’s wired to be on alert for, it seeks out new ones.

Instead of scanning the savannah for a lion, it’s overanalyzing why someone added a period to their last text but not the one before that.

Martin Luther King Jr. described this battle as the North vs. South of our soul. “""There is something of a civil war going on within all of our lives… And there is this continual struggle within the very structure of every individual life,"" he said.

It’s a daily battle. But one worth fighting.

66,,OCD,"Going to crosspost this in r/mentalhealth and r/OCD.

So a few years ago now, I was diagnosed with OCD; unfortunately kept getting unwanted violent/sexual intrusive thoughts. I was on and off fluoxetine but now I'm sitting at 40mg a day and have been for over a year.

Over the bank end of 2020 during the lockdown (UK Based), I started smoking marijuana recreationally, I'm 26 at the moment so not a teen and assumed I would not be at risk of the side effects. I won't lie, I got greedy with it and between December and January I smoked most nights.

I smoked when I was a teen on occasion, all of the stoner films spoke to me and made it feel like this drug was harmless. I remember being about 19, having a big smoking and drinking session with some friends at the time.

After this night I felt an immense sense of depersonalisation and derealisation, I genuinely believe I have blocked most of this out in my mind but I recall it going on for many, many months and it effecting my studies at college and relationship at the time.

This eventually passed and I dealt with other OCD/depression related issues.

Going to the modern day, I couldn't get any weed from my usual guy so I went elsewhere, the person I bought from I have known years and trust 100%, he warned me ""It's very strong stuff so go careful"" (Lemon Amnesia Haze). I smoked in on a Saturday night, my girlfriend doesn't smoke so she was sober. I hit a bong and go lay on the floor in the living room. Time immediately lost all meaning, I started freaking out, BADLY. Even writing about it now is reminding me of it and making me very anxious.

I kept thinking I was going to act on violent impulsive thoughts about my girlfriend, she knows all about my OCD and trusts me not to do these things, but it felt like my OCD was telling me to hit her, hurt her, or that I had been unfaithful in the past.

I paced in the backgarden for over an hour on the phone to my family telling them how I'd made a huge mistake and crying. This eventually calmed down, I'd say my anxiety level went from a 10 to a 6.5, I managed to go to sleep about 2:30am.

The next day I woke up, still feeling like garbage, visited my mother, and took all the weed that I had and gave it to a friend who's a big stoner. (He went on to tell me he smoked one joint and passed out which is unlike him). I had a terrible few weeks, some of the worst in my entire life, I had to take unpaid time off work because I couldn't face speaking to people.

I went back to work as financial stress was also weighing heavy on my shoulders. I still don't feel I've recovered; I had been doing better until last weekend, I had a lot of stress after being part of a mental health group on FB; someone posted they are going to kill themselves at 3am, I was sensitive anyway as I couldn't sleep.

Ended up spending the night on the phone to the police, finding his address through Facebook and I visited the house myself at 4:30 when the police and ambulance were there just to make sure he got the help he needed (He has and he is currently in the mental health hospital recovering successfully!)

This has caused me to have another breakdown; I am philosophising everything and it worries me.

How do I know I'm real?

How do I know the world around me is real?

If it isn't real, does it all even matter? Does anything I do in this life matter?

How do I know my happiness is the same as someone else's? Does the colour blue look the same for me as other people?

How do I know my internal monologue is real? Or the voices I hear and things I see when I fall asleep, how do I know if they're actually hypogognic hallucinations or not a sign of something else?

I'm going down some dark rabbit holes and I feel alone and scared in it. I know I have OCD, so I am likely obsessing over this but it's scary as hell.

&amp;#x200B;

I was getting therapy for sexual/violent impulsive thoughts but we have put it on hold since my breakdown as we thought exposure therapy at the minute might make me feel worse.

I just feel lost, I am worried I may get delusions of grandeur or schizophrenic symptoms, just feeling really scared and want it to get better.

68,,OCD,"This is very long but I can’t afford therapy so I was hoping to share my struggles here.

In the last year my mental health has hit new lows but this is not a new development. I feel like my brain makes always me hyper-moral. Any mistake or possibility of a future mistake is absolutely corrupting and I should kill myself.

My elementary years were full of events of me making myself sick from stress and staying home from school. 

I spent most of my teen years and now my early twenties paranoid about being gay. My Mom repeatedly asked me if I was during my high school years. I never brought home any girfriends and my Dad was concerned that I did drama instead of sports. In unrelated conversations, my Mom has said God views homosexuals and pedophiles as equal perversions and sin. Gee thanks Mom. That’ll haunt me later.

I feel like I pushed to lose my virginity before I was really ready just to prove I wasn’t gay. Having sex for the first time outside of marriage (which goes against my family’s strict values) made me have a nervous breakdown where I wasn’t able to leave my bed for a week and was puking off and on with anxiety spikes.

I moved out of the house pretty young to get out of that environment, left the church and surrounded myself with LGBTQ affirming friends. Very sweet group that I love to death. However in the comfort and openness of this friend group I realize I’m not gay. My brain didn’t fear it as much anymore so I was able to think much clearer. I also had lots of sexual partners in this process. Never any gay ones. I was afraid if I had sex with the same sex and I truly wasn’t gay, then I would kill myself before coming out to my family.

That conversation with my mom though, stuck with me. Now I’ve been paranoid that maybe I was not gay, but a pedophile. This fear only became a possibility after I turned 18. I’ve deleted social medias that are high risk of having porn, including this one in the past, fearing some photos may be underage. I had previously planned to work in IT, but I changed career paths. I now completely fear the internet. It’s crippling. I love video games and when my friends moved to PC from console I refused for years just to avoid easy access to the internet.

My brother still uses a flip phone to avoid social media. He always told me about the dangers of
porn and it’s detriment to his marriage. That too has stuck with me. He doesn’t allow himself unmonitored computer time even when checking emails for a few minutes.

My mom and I are both on Lexapro for anxiety, she admitted to me that she struggles with extreme anxiety and thoughts of suicide. I told her only that I was suffering from stress. She encouraged me to come back to church, pray and ask for forgiveness for whatever has me unsettled and I could find relief. 

I have a fear of being alone and unworthy of love so I cling to any relationship to the point of codependency. I’m scared of my own identity so I share theirs. I don’t know who I am. I don’t know if I want to know.

TLDR:
There are many more subtle things I struggle with on a weekly basis, but my obsessions center on sexuality, morals, and faith.

&lt;p&gt;In the last year my mental health has hit new lows but this is not a new development. I feel like my brain makes always me hyper-moral. Any mistake or possibility of a future mistake is absolutely corrupting and I should kill myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My elementary years were full of events of me making myself sick from stress and staying home from school. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent most of my teen years and now my early twenties paranoid about being gay. My Mom repeatedly asked me if I was during my high school years. I never brought home any girfriends and my Dad was concerned that I did drama instead of sports. In unrelated conversations, my Mom has said God views homosexuals and pedophiles as equal perversions and sin. Gee thanks Mom. That’ll haunt me later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I pushed to lose my virginity before I was really ready just to prove I wasn’t gay. Having sex for the first time outside of marriage (which goes against my family’s strict values) made me have a nervous breakdown where I wasn’t able to leave my bed for a week and was puking off and on with anxiety spikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I moved out of the house pretty young to get out of that environment, left the church and surrounded myself with LGBTQ affirming friends. Very sweet group that I love to death. However in the comfort and openness of this friend group I realize I’m not gay. My brain didn’t fear it as much anymore so I was able to think much clearer. I also had lots of sexual partners in this process. Never any gay ones. I was afraid if I had sex with the same sex and I truly wasn’t gay, then I would kill myself before coming out to my family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That conversation with my mom though, stuck with me. Now I’ve been paranoid that maybe I was not gay, but a pedophile. This fear only became a possibility after I turned 18. I’ve deleted social medias that are high risk of having porn, including this one in the past, fearing some photos may be underage. I had previously planned to work in IT, but I changed career paths. I now completely fear the internet. It’s crippling. I love video games and when my friends moved to PC from console I refused for years just to avoid easy access to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brother still uses a flip phone to avoid social media. He always told me about the dangers of
porn and it’s detriment to his marriage. That too has stuck with me. He doesn’t allow himself unmonitored computer time even when checking emails for a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

79,,OCD,"# Hello!

I've been feeling horrible the last few days, with my OCD often telling me that I'm a bad person, my intrusive thoughts very intense and some things been ruined.

BUT! I wanted to adopt the JackSepticEye mindset and try to make others feel positive if I'm feeling down. So I want everyone who sees this to share a positive experience that happened this week, month, or even year, depending on the last positive experience you had. If you haven't had one, don't worry - you will have one soon, I promise. This doesn't last forever, there are moments however brief of hope.

Please try to avoid triggering words and avoid certain language etc.

So I'll start off;

One of my key OCD themes is trying to force me to feel so guilty about everything that is thrown at my mind that I can't enjoy time with my girlfriend or her family, and this week I managed to sit down for a couple of hours on facetime and plan out a trip to Paris with my girlfriend in November. It was really great and I can remember feeling distinctly happy, hopeful and excited for that time.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been feeling horrible the last few days, with my OCD often telling me that I&amp;#39;m a bad person, my intrusive thoughts very intense and some things been ruined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BUT! I wanted to adopt the JackSepticEye mindset and try to make others feel positive if I&amp;#39;m feeling down. So I want everyone who sees this to share a positive experience that happened this week, month, or even year, depending on the last positive experience you had. If you haven&amp;#39;t had one, don&amp;#39;t worry - you will have one soon, I promise. This doesn&amp;#39;t last forever, there are moments however brief of hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please try to avoid triggering words and avoid certain language etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;ll start off;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my key OCD themes is trying to force me to feel so guilty about everything that is thrown at my mind that I can&amp;#39;t enjoy time with my girlfriend or her family, and this week I managed to sit down for a couple of hours on facetime and plan out a trip to Paris with my girlfriend in November. It was really great and I can remember feeling distinctly happy, hopeful and excited for that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;#39;s your turn! Let&amp;#39;s try and brighten everyone&amp;#39;s day a little and help us all realise that things will be okay. &lt;/p&gt;

83,,OCD,"I'm sorry that if by asking these questions I'm breaking the rules of this subreddit but I don't know what else to do. I think I have OCD, I'm not looking for advice on whether or not I have OCD, I'm just wondering whether I should go to a doctor because I don't want to go to one and then look stupid because what I think are obsessions or compulsions are actually completely normal. 

Basically the symptoms that I have are repeating words or phrases that I hear or see over and over again and if I don't something terrible will happen in relation to those words, I tend to say them in 3's, so if it's a long enough sentence I will say it 3 times, If its a few words I will say it 9 times so 3 groups of three and sometimes if its just one word I'll repeat it 27 times.

It doesn't necessarily follow this pattern though, sometimes I'll repeat it until it feels ok to stop. 

I also have a fear of contamination, I think I've had a slight fear for a few years but Covid-19 has exacerbated it. I don't think its too bad, sometimes I'll wash my hands two or three times in a row. I won't touch any food with my hands that I'm going to eat without first washing my hands, and if I touch a packet or something then I'll wash my hands again before eating my food.

Also I have a fear of the time whenever its the same number of minutes past a specific hour, for example 8 minutes past 8, 9 minutes past 9. If I see these times I have to say a specific thing in my head 7 times, (three times, so 21 in total) and then three more times just to be sure I've kept everyone I love safe. I tend to avoid looking at clocks now around those times and I've put a sticker on my laptop covering the time so I can relax while doing online college.

I'm just wondering whether anyone has any advice as to who I should go to. I'm too embarrassed/ ashamed to admit it to my mom even though I know I shouldn't be.

98,,OCD,"This obsession came on ultra quick, it's HIV. My first trigger was a hookup I had a few months back, never even though of HIV being even a remote possibility. Probably because I was too overwhelmed with the obsession that I could have gotten her pregnant. Luckily by the time this obsession caught up with me it was at six weeks and I could shell out $100 for a conclusive HIV test, it was negative.

I honestly feel dumb writing this to be honest but maybe it'll help me process. Honestly was having a good day, fighting compulsions, good mood etc. I went to get food from the grocery store and on my out I stepped in what I thought to be puke. No exaggeration an immediate 180. Panicking, what if there was HIV, immediately go to google, no reported cases ever from vomit contact. Breath of relief? Nope!

Still in full panic, went home put food in freezer, didn't know what to do, thought spiraling, only compulsion I had to do was to go back and look at what I thought to be puke.

Couldn't even bring myself to throw it away.

\~One week later I decided to go by MORE frozen food and put it in the freezer AWAY from the other stuff, great! Was calm for the time being. Room mate moved it on top of the other food. I was so hungry one night I decided as some sort of self ERP bs to eat the food on the top, which wasn't even touching the boxes of food that was from that day (or so I think). Weird circumstance, but this food had a sauce that went with it that had to be opened, did that with my *contaminated* fingers. Put the sauce on the already warmed food, ate the food, and since been in a panic everyday, taken by the fact I am going to get HIV. I can't shake this one, I really can't. Will have to wait six weeks until I can test (conclusively) so seems that is a bit away :)

&lt;p&gt;Still in full panic, went home put food in freezer, didn&amp;#39;t know what to do, thought spiraling, only compulsion I had to do was to go back and look at what I thought to be puke. &lt;a href=""https://gyazo.com/0a57612f344838af64dba2e746e218b3""&gt;Didn&amp;#39;t look like&lt;/a&gt; it, but was still paranoid. It kind of settled, I agreed to just not eat the food in the freezer? Couldn&amp;#39;t even bring myself to throw it away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~One week later I decided to go by MORE frozen food and put it in the freezer AWAY from the other stuff, great! Was calm for the time being. Room mate moved it on top of the other food. I was so hungry one night I decided as some sort of self ERP bs to eat the food on the top, which wasn&amp;#39;t even touching the boxes of food that was from that day (or so I think). Weird circumstance, but this food had a sauce that went with it that had to be opened, did that with my &lt;em&gt;contaminated&lt;/em&gt; fingers. Put the sauce on the already warmed food, ate the food, and since been in a panic everyday, taken by the fact I am going to get HIV. I can&amp;#39;t shake this one, I really can&amp;#39;t. Will have to wait six weeks until I can test (conclusively) so seems that is a bit away :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This obsession is starting to spread into other things as well which is getting REALLY out of hand. I don&amp;#39;t know if I can go any lower than this. Honestly questioning whether I should admit myself because this is really borderline psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;

Money is not a factor.**

**PS. sorry for the length of this post, though it does add some context to the situation!**

I appreciate this is not a place for career advice, but I feel that people here will understand what I'm going through.

I'll start by saying - I hate my job. I'm a people manager; and as someone with OCD I'm far too empathetic, which gets in the way of being able to discipline etc... I've spent sleepless nights thinking about work. My boss knows this as I've shared this with her over the course of the last year or more.

So I went part time last year - I have a day each week for self care. At first that day was being used to study web development thinking I need to find my passion (I love anything techy), but it didn't stick - so it literally is just a nice break in the week but I value it a lot.

**Here's my problem:**

\- ***The new job***: I have been applying for more techy jobs and found a role as a systems analyst for a company which deals with medical grievances - this is quite a triggering subject for me as it reminds me of investigations i've been forced to conduct at work, and my own family history as sadly people in my family have faced prison time etc... which of course all impacts my mental health over time. I'm trying to ignore the fact that this company does this as I wouldn't be directly involved, I'm there for the systems not the core role. It sounded great and I had no doubt in my mind about leaving my current job - even if it meant giving up my day off in the week. They have offered me this position and I accepted.

\- ***The current place of work:*** I have a new dilemma, just before my job offer came though (minutes before), my boss has offered a job swap that would make me a project type person working to improve the customer service that the team provide. I shared at this stage that I'd accepted another role as I felt it responsible to do so then. The thing is **I would enjoy this role**, but my future there would still be uncertain. She sees me doing this for only a year then *promises* to find me something more aligned with what I want long term (something more techy/analytical) - and not go back to people management. The culture here is good, they've supported me throughout my mental health journey by allowing me time for appointments, approving the part time hours and being generally very flexible.

\- ***The decision:*** so, my OCD is currently preventing me from making a decision. I really really value my day off, I can keep this in my current place of work, have a new job for at least a year without any people responsibilities, but I'm unsure what the future holds. I'm scared to give this up and start working full time again without much knowledge of the new business (glassdoor review suggests the culture is good and there is an element of home working) - however the role with the new place itself will give me tech skills I can't currently present on my CV. Been thinking about it for 3 days now and no closer to a decision (as far as the new company is concerned I have accepted and they are charging ahead). Ps.

It sounded great and I had no doubt in my mind about leaving my current job - even if it meant giving up my day off in the week. They have offered me this position and I accepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The current place of work:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; I have a new dilemma, just before my job offer came though (minutes before), my boss has offered a job swap that would make me a project type person working to improve the customer service that the team provide. I shared at this stage that I&amp;#39;d accepted another role as I felt it responsible to do so then. The thing is &lt;strong&gt;I would enjoy this role&lt;/strong&gt;, but my future there would still be uncertain. She sees me doing this for only a year then &lt;em&gt;promises&lt;/em&gt; to find me something more aligned with what I want long term (something more techy/analytical) - and not go back to people management. The culture here is good, they&amp;#39;ve supported me throughout my mental health journey by allowing me time for appointments, approving the part time hours and being generally very flexible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The decision:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; so, my OCD is currently preventing me from making a decision. I really really value my day off, I can keep this in my current place of work, have a new job for at least a year without any people responsibilities, but I&amp;#39;m unsure what the future holds. I&amp;#39;m scared to give this up and start working full time again without much knowledge of the new business (glassdoor review suggests the culture is good and there is an element of home working) - however the role with the new place itself will give me tech skills I can&amp;#39;t currently present on my CV. Been thinking about it for 3 days now and no closer to a decision (as far as the new company is concerned I have accepted and they are charging ahead). Ps. Money is not a factor, I&amp;#39;d technically earn more full time.&lt;/p&gt;

113,,OCD,"POTENTIAL TRIGGER WARNING




I’m so terrified of saying obscenities or atrocious things out loud that whenever I’m in public I am constantly making clicking sounds, clearing my throat, or making syllables or sounds that sometimes resemble curse words or disgusting hateful things (never saying the actual word or at least I would never ever ever ever ever intentionally do so in this compulsive checking process) to prove to myself that I didn’t just say them (like checking different sounds—idk my brain has convinced me this helps), and to know I am not saying them currently. 

I also become painfully aware of my tongue’s position in my mouth and convince myself every little movement or sound it naturally is making sounds like a bad word, and then have to compulsively recreate all those movements and sounds over and over thus restarting the process.

I’ll check how different syllables feel and sound to make and repeat them over and over and sometimes accidentally make a few sounds that somewhat sound like a hateful or obscene word when said one after the other in public and start the whole panicking and guilt all over again—even though I have ZERO intention of saying anything bad to or around anyone and it’s probably only my OCD telling me I did! I am not a hateful person, and would never say anything hateful to someone else. 

I know that our thoughts don’t define us, but this feels like action, especially when I know the sounds I’m making or the syllables I’m making could resemble whatever bad word I’m hyper-fixating on in the moment. Yet, it’s like I can’t stop. If I don’t make the similar sounds, I feel like my OCD will somehow say the ACTUAL word or will convince me I did already—so the compulsive sound making keeps me in check. 

But also i feel like I need to “prove” I can make similar syllables or sounds without saying whatever word or phrase I’m terrified of saying, and that it’s okay to make those sounds.

It’s like very layered but anyway today I completely felt like I was not in control of my own vocal chords and mouth movements. It was terrifying and I kept making sounds that resembled different bad words, slurs, or phrases in public despite the fact that I was making the noises literally to avoid or prove I wasn’t and never would say the actual words! (And I really, truly wouldn’t and would never have an actual urge to!)

114,,OCD,"I want to preface by saying that I am a healthcare professional (though do not have experience working directly with people with OCD, but do have experience working in mental health helping people with anxiety). I do generally consider myself to be pretty sensitive/considerate, but obviously things are different when its a family member/someone you live with daily. 

This family member has always been somewhat ""picky"" about cleanliness/sharing since they were young which honestly was irritating/may even come off as snobbish (ie. being really difficult when you ask to share something like toiletries you forgot to bring when travelling, using a living room blanket they feel is ""theirs"", using their bathroom, etc). 

Recently, the pandemic has definitely heightened their need to be clean. They frequently wash their hands much more often than any of us throughout the day, sometimes 3 times within like a 15 minute period while not doing anything that visibly spoils them and may ask for reassurance that they're clean. They do typically spend a lot longer than any of us in the bathroom in the morning/night. Avoids going outside more than the rest of us during this time, cleans hands constantly with alcohol outside and makes sure we do the same. These have felt somewhat like obsessive and compulsive tendencies (beyond just needing to be clean).

I think as a family we generally do try to be understanding, we almost never ask to use her bathroom anymore even though its located most conveniently to common areas. She has her own set of plates/dishes/cups (which she bought because they were cute) and does not let any of us use. We try to do the grocery shopping /outside chores, even my parents who are at way higher risk of COVID complications than her. But I think the thing that bothers me most is she gets really annoyed (and expresses it passive aggressively) when people move/touch her things. This can be as simple as a plate she left in the microwave, or a cup she left by the stove that was in the way so we moved it for her without asking (we already ask more often than not to avoid her irritableness). 

Obviously, I do not feel comfortable saying she has OCD, but to people who experience cleaning as a compulsion due to fear of contamination, is this something I should be more understanding about because she may experience very real fear/anxiety over what would happen if I touch her belongings/share her things? I think it's been difficult because we often feel like we're the ones ""dirty"" because of her behaviours, and the little inconveniences of having to ask and wait every time for her to move her own things accumulate.

123,,OCD,"Hey, so I feel like a douche for posting this. I have a...bit of a history, which I'm trying to make amends for a little. I've been trying to get more involved in community and social justice activism, raising awareness of bigotries and human rights abuses, intersectionality, calling out people including friends , and cutting them off where necessary etc. However, I've recently become very self conscious about what I'm saying and doing again. This morning, I woke up early (after 5 hours of sleep or so) and lay in bed for 2 hours just wondering ""am I a good person?"" Sometimes I'll want to share a petition but then start thinking whether this is just being self congratulating as an ally. In general I start wondering whether it's OK to take breaks and set boundaries, or whether this is fragility and being unwilling to do emotional labour. I also start questioning whether I should be friends with people who don't precisely align with my values...which I worry is really not good for my social skills tbh but the urge to do the right thing is there now!   


I don't know whether this is just weak boundaries or some form of moral OCD, because I've had Pure O in the past (diagnosis is GAD, and ASD with depressive 'low mood' tendencies) I also wonder because I'm an ex Christian, and while never a fundamentalist, when I do try to be selfish I get the feeling of sinning like I used to. I've done Religious OCD rituals before among others, so it's possible it's OCD.

if anybody can help at all that'd be great please. Another sub recommended OCD Action to me. The only  activist friend I've confided to about this is unfortunately quite obsessive-compulsive herself, so basically triggered more neuroticism. She suggested being more cognizant about what I'm going to do before I act...which is the opposite of what my therapists have historically suggested lol. My best friend is also super self conscious about racism at the moment so I don't want to bother him while he's going through stuff.

129,,OCD,"(This may have been done already so I'm sorry if it has)
I think it could really help people with OCD to have a thread of lesser known or less obvious symptoms. It could become a compulsion to check the list, of course, but it could also help people to understand their minds a bit better. I'll start off and anyone who feels comfortable sharing their symptoms can add on. This might get a little embarrassing at some parts. Bear in mind this is mostly going to focus on harm ocd but any other forms are welcome.

1. Altered perception - When you have OCD, you will convince yourself that everything you do ties into whatever your obsession wants you to believe you are. You'll read articles about disorders and your brain will literally lie to you and make you think you fit the symptoms, even if some of the symptoms are 100% normal or don't apply to you.

2. Cold sweats - When you ""realize"" you're a narcissist/sociopath/psychopath/pedophile, this feeling comes over you like you've just realized your whole live has been a lie and you need to do something about it. This feeling is so intense it gives me the cold sweats, not sure if this is common or not.

3. ...Bathroom issues - This one is definitely tmi and pretty gross but I have to know if this is common with other OCD sufferers. We will literally worry ourselves sick to the point of having diarrhea. 

4. Invisible compulsions - I used to think I didn't have compulsions until I began taking online tests constantly and researching mental disorders to make sure I don't have them.

5. Subtle self harm - Things like skin picking, withholding comfort or entertainment from ourselves, or thinking we don't deserve therapy are forms of self harm that are less obvious if you don't know how to spot them.

6. Moments of clarity - Sometimes our OCD gets tired and decides to leave us alone for a few seconds. It's the best feeling ever and also the worst because you know it won't last long.

7. Cycling themes - This one is probably pretty standard but still worth mentioning. Often times when we tire out one obsession, a new one comes right after. 

8. Obsession with purity - The post I made about this is what inspired me to make this list because it seemed to resonate with people. Essentially, some people with OCD cannot accept that they are less than perfect, but not in an egotistical way. We're just so scared of being harmful that the thought of us being capable of it brings us to tears.

I think it could really help people with OCD to have a thread of lesser known or less obvious symptoms. It could become a compulsion to check the list, of course, but it could also help people to understand their minds a bit better. I&amp;#39;ll start off and anyone who feels comfortable sharing their symptoms can add on. This might get a little embarrassing at some parts. Bear in mind this is mostly going to focus on harm ocd but any other forms are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altered perception - When you have OCD, you will convince yourself that everything you do ties into whatever your obsession wants you to believe you are. You&amp;#39;ll read articles about disorders and your brain will literally lie to you and make you think you fit the symptoms, even if some of the symptoms are 100% normal or don&amp;#39;t apply to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cold sweats - When you &amp;quot;realize&amp;quot; you&amp;#39;re a narcissist/sociopath/psychopath/pedophile, this feeling comes over you like you&amp;#39;ve just realized your whole live has been a lie and you need to do something about it. This feeling is so intense it gives me the cold sweats, not sure if this is common or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;...Bathroom issues - This one is definitely tmi and pretty gross but I have to know if this is common with other OCD sufferers. We will literally worry ourselves sick to the point of having diarrhea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

137,,OCD," I wanted to pray to Gods about something using my thoughts (praying thoughts).

 A conversation between my brother and father drew my attention and my praying thoughts continued without me paying attention to them cause I focused on the conversation.

After 30-60 seconds, I started worrying without knowing exactly why. I randomly started worrying that I MAY have messed up my words and kept repeating the same mistaken word more than once, without realising it. That mistake maybe made me look like as if I was asking for something bad.

I cant remember making such a mistake. Maybe it is just an hypothesis just because I was not paying attention to my thoughts.

 Before that, in the past, I have said to Gods that mistakes may happen in my prayers and no matter what I say or think, with or without my will, NEVER ACCEPT THOSE THOUGHTS/PRAYERS and protecet me from them.

141,,OCD,"I'm feeling pretty drained lately from my obsessions and since plain searching the internet hasn't come up with anything I'm turning to Reddit for help.

I have a strange type of OCD that I haven't really seen anybody else mention. This revolves around needing my things to be ""perfect"". Scratches, dings, dents on anything, even pots and pans, result in me having to get rid of it and get a new one. If I don't do this, I obsess about it until I get it done.

153,,OCD,"I'm 22, have had OCD pretty much my entire life (some of my earliest memories are of my symptoms, though I wasn't diagnosed until I was 17). I'm on medication and in therapy and both help a lot. However, the pandemic and a LOT of situational stuff have made this past year tough, and my OCD has been bad this past week or so because my brother - who I live with - is sick (not COVID, although I keep convincing myself that's what it is even though he's doing fine/getting better). Obviously as you can imagine, my obsessions/compulsions around illness are worse right now, but so is everything - especially this feeling of needing to tap/blink/make specific movements a certain number of times/until it feels right. To put it bluntly, my body feels possessed and it sucks. I'm so anxious and feel like every sense is completely overloaded when I'm around my family. I have to touch light switches a certain number of times, push on water faucets a certain number of times, and sometimes if I'm just anxious I'll just blink or shake my hands to try to feel right. (I wondered if it was stimming but I've heard stimming is supposed to bring relief...it's hard to tell the difference but this kinda feels more like an OCD ""trying to feel just right"" thing.) My muscles are also really twitchy at night as I start to relax and wind down; my shoulders will twitch sometimes and it's weird (I carry most of my tension there). I don't have tourette's or tics in general that I know of; the twitching feels like it's releasing tension and actually feels kind of good. But I feel like a freak. Does anyone relate/can anyone explain any of this? I guess there's just something so weirdly physical about all of this that's weirding me out. I see people on tiktok talk a lot about stimming and tics so that's where my brain goes, but I don't think that's what I'm dealing with? It's different I think but I don't know how to explain how or how to know if I'm even right.

However, the pandemic and a LOT of situational stuff have made this past year tough, and my OCD has been bad this past week or so because my brother - who I live with - is sick (not COVID, although I keep convincing myself that&amp;#39;s what it is even though he&amp;#39;s doing fine/getting better). Obviously as you can imagine, my obsessions/compulsions around illness are worse right now, but so is everything - especially this feeling of needing to tap/blink/make specific movements a certain number of times/until it feels right. To put it bluntly, my body feels possessed and it sucks. I&amp;#39;m so anxious and feel like every sense is completely overloaded when I&amp;#39;m around my family. I have to touch light switches a certain number of times, push on water faucets a certain number of times, and sometimes if I&amp;#39;m just anxious I&amp;#39;ll just blink or shake my hands to try to feel right. (I wondered if it was stimming but I&amp;#39;ve heard stimming is supposed to bring relief...it&amp;#39;s hard to tell the difference but this kinda feels more like an OCD &amp;quot;trying to feel just right&amp;quot; thing.) My muscles are also really twitchy at night as I start to relax and wind down; my shoulders will twitch sometimes and it&amp;#39;s weird (I carry most of my tension there). I don&amp;#39;t have tourette&amp;#39;s or tics in general that I know of; the twitching feels like it&amp;#39;s releasing tension and actually feels kind of good. But I feel like a freak. Does anyone relate/can anyone explain any of this? I guess there&amp;#39;s just something so weirdly physical about all of this that&amp;#39;s weirding me out. I see people on tiktok talk a lot about stimming and tics so that&amp;#39;s where my brain goes, but I don&amp;#39;t think that&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;m dealing with? It&amp;#39;s different I think but I don&amp;#39;t know how to explain how or how to know if I&amp;#39;m even right. (Also - I have CPTSD; that is definitely triggered too and contributing to the anxiety/may explain some of this, though idk how.)&lt;/p&gt;

What i actually fear the most is that i get like apathetic after having so much anxiety in the process, like it's good? what if i'm becoming actually a horrible person?

I also think i've been depressed for some time ago, and now i want to improve myself and be better, but this thing is keeping me at rock bottom sometimes, i want to be less rigid, want to do what i want, but i think that i'm not living but rather having a constant wall of fear that destroys enjoyment in my life.

165,,OCD,"Hello there everyone! i have a girlfriend for 2 years now, and she is the most beautifull girl inside and out. A couple months ago she got the diagnosis OCD   because of a past of traumatic events. 

In the beginning it started with small things like moving my glasses when i sleep because they were on her nightstand and objects of others shouldn't be touching her belongings. But it has gotten so much worse since then.

I can't be in her bedroom while she is away, even when she has to go to the toilet. Touching (like hugging) has became off-limits when she is sad or stressed, and she has developed spastic movements while sleeping. 

There are so much more of these examples, and although they are a inconvenience for our relationship and quite stressfull and hard for me (and ofcourse for her), she is the love of my life. Like literally, she is the most beautiful person there is.

But enough of the cheesy love proclaiming, my question for you guys is: do you have any tips so that my girlfriend is as comfortable as possible during this hard time? She really finds it uncomfortable to talk about it herself, and i dont know who to reach since i promised her i would keep it a secret.

I dont want to encourage her tics, but i also dont want to give her a panic attack. I can't imagine what she goes through, and the same goes to all of you.

171,,OCD,"The title says it all. 

I didn't notice what an irreversible tragedy my life has become.

OCD (and intrusive thoughts and images of even sexual/violent nature) ruined my life and I didn't even know it until it was too late. Because I didn't know it was OCD. I just thought I was fucking weird due to childhood trauma. I didn't know it was a mental illness, that was completely normal and had a cure/treatment. No one diagnosed me, no one gave it a name. 

I diagnosed myself some time ago, but didn't seek treatment for some reason (I thought I was way too ""fucked up"" to treat. That the baggage ways way too big. THIS IS NOT TRUE.) And now it might be too late.

I lost 15 years to this.

My mother has a lot of mental issues so I think I inherited it. I had a rough childhood. My parents divorced when I was little (very bad circumstances) and my mother had to basically escape in secret with me from abroad. 

We kept moving. From my grandma to a new city and to another one. I didn't have any security, sense of safety and home. This was what caused the underlying anxiety that got worse over the years.

My mother loved me back then but she was not enough. I had a weird relationship with my father (living abroad, he didn't really contact me even though he loved me.)

I was already very anxious as a child and thinking back I was definitely showing OCD tendencies.

But I was always FULL OF LOVE and empathy. I could never tolerate injustice and was a highly sensitive person.

My first panic attack happened when I was 11 after a passing moment of DPDR (as a result of my mother being tipsy on her birthday and my child self/brain couldn't handle it, I guess.)

I kept having panic attacks (not hyperventilating, just super fast heartbeat and being super scared) so we went to a psychiatrist.

She didn't give it a name. Didn't diagnose me. Didn't reassure me or told me it's fine.

She called it: "" you riled yourself up"". WTF. Incompetent trash.

She told me if it ever happened again, I should watch TV (and then maybe our upcoming holiday would get rid of 'it'. WTF.) So that's what I did. And then at night I would listen to the radio.

The holiday did not get rid of 'it'. Obviously.

I also developed sleep walking, but stopped after a few months. (At one point I almost climbed over a balcony fence while sleep walking. It was a second floor apartment. Terrifying.)

(My panic attacks stopped after a while (can't remember when precisely.) but came back for a Summer in high school and I would get them 1-2x/year after that.)

My mother's new boyfriend started to be worse and worse (narcissist, verbal abuse) and became my worst enemy and source of the life ruining OCD. He is a vile, disgusting man. Absolute trash.

It was in high school that I started to develop the real OCD.

Everything he touched became dirty to me. After a few years I couldn't even listen to his voice, I had to sing or cover my ears. I started avoiding objects in my room and obsessively cleaning everything.

I couldn't watch my favorite TV shows because my whole area seemed dirty. I don't know how to explain it. His pure presence in the house was enough to feel dirty.

There were items I kept in a box so they would remain clean.

I couldn't wait to move out of the house and into my own so I can finally enjoy things again.

But that's not how it works.

In my new house there were things that were already contaminated with ""his touch"". Obviously.  So I started avoiding those.

My two half brothers (their father is this man, but I loved THEM so much): I couldn't hug them or kiss them properly because they were ""contaminated"". When I did kiss and hug them I had to wash my face for 5 minutes at home and wash the clothes separately sometimes.

The worst part started after a few years after moving from home. I started to think about this man during the day. I don't know why. He just popped into my head. What would he think of what I'm doing? I imagined him criticizing me. It started happening more and more frequently.

His name started to pop up in my head as well. So I started saying random words in my head to counter it.

This became constant.

I also had paranoid thoughts of him as well. What if he hated me so much, that he would actively try to do something to hurt me?

At around this time, we decided with my best friend that we would start a relationship. I remember after we agreed to start a relationship I started having thoughts about the man and this made me fucking sad. I couldn't 100% enjoy my boyfriend's company. And he was the most important person to me.

On the first night we moved together (I was beyond happy), I had my first violent intrusive thought =this is unrelated to the man, but stilll OCD): ""What if I kill him in my sleep?"" What. I was fucking devastated. Why did I think this? What if I do? Could I do it?

**OCD thoughts do this. They go after the things that are most important to you. And there is NO LOGIC or TRUTH to them.**

I was almost too afraid to go to sleep that night. I kept thinking how I would wake up and he would be be dead and how his parents would cry. Just why.

But I woke up and no one was hurt. OBVIOUSLY. So this thought passed then.

(Later, these thoughts came back at times with intrusive images of hurting him and/or his family.)

(I buried these thoughts deep within myself and did my hardest to deny them. I was not ready to think of myself as a ""monster"" because I loved him more, than anything. I wasn't a monster! They were just intrusive thoughts and that's all. But of course knowing that, you can still feel like hell.)

But then came the time we would be together sexually. (I was afraid of this in advance.)

And yes, the image of the man popped up (next to other evil people from history...). And then kept popping up almost every time we would do something sexual.

I don't know how I kept going. I did 1000000s of mental compulsions to get rid of the images and thoughts and my intimacy suffered for it. I could NOT express myself sexually how I wanted to. I wanted to lose myself to the pleasures of sex but then I had an intrusive violent/sexual thought of the man and so it was ruined. Same with masturbation.

My mental compulsions to get rid of the images/thoughts started to get more and more violent. That was the only way I could calm down mentally.

Of course I started to have thoughts like ""What if I think about him, because I secretly want to"""" - This was the worst- and it was obviously not true.

The last 5 years the intrusive thoughts were constantly there. Violent, sexual, everything.

And I kept thinking of things that I hated about him/were disgusting about him. (He wears glasses sometimes so I started being annoyed by people who wear glasses.)

I even have these compulsions to ""draw the outline of things"". And I can feel my hands wanting to move =this could be a sign of something else.)

At some point my half brothers came over to our apartment.

After that I realized that what they touched and where they sit was contaminated. And then I felt like ""it"" spread to everything in the apartment.

&amp;#x200B;

* **The house**

**From ages 11-20 my childhood was SHIT. I dreaded evenings and especially weekends. I had to take this man being home and making my life hell. I would look at other kids looking forward to the weekends and being with their loving families.**

For me, it was always verbal abuse (sometimes physical as well), emotional blackmail, shouting, cursing and NOISE. 

All I ever wanted from life was f\*cking PEACE AND SILENCE. That's all. 

My mother took my side sometimes but only on the surface. No matter how many times I begged her to leave him and move and CHOOSE ME, she didn't. Even though she was verbally abused too on a regular basis. She cried a lot, so did I. 

She said she didn't want her sons to grow up without a father, like I did. I was sacrificed.

I remember the lowest point was when it was my 15th birthday and we started arguing about something and he came after me and actually said ""I'll kill you"". Even then my mother wouldn't leave. That's all you have to know.

My mother became a traitor to me.

We moved houses 5 times with my boyfriend. I just feel so sorry for him. Our first house was amazing, but we couldn't stay because the rent was too high.

From that point on, it's just downhill. I couldn't find my home/peace in any of the apartments (hellish neighbors/car noises...etc.)

I started getting angrier and more frustrated with life. Depression was getting worse, but I didn't realize this because I was too busy thinking about how I hated living everywhere.

At some point I felt like everything was contaminated.

I started to keep my groin area clenched as a compulsion.

I stopped inviting my brothers over because I didn't want them to touch anything in the apartment (or sit on the toilet...etc.) - This was also because I was paranoid that he would know our address and come over when I was home alone - there was no chance for this, but I couldn't shake these feelings.

I met with my brothers outside somewhere (cinema, park, restaurant...etc.) They didn't understand why they couldn't come over. Obviously I couldn't tell them, so I made up some excuses. I felt like shit.

My mother/family was making everything SO MUCH WORSE in the meanwhile. I cut them off because I couldn't handle how they didn't choose my side in all of this. They acted like there was nothing wrong, while still complaining about him behind his back.

My mother kept telling/asking me to forgive him and go back back home to talk. I never told her just how much they ruined my life. But I hated her so much.

It was like she kept turning a knife in my wounds.

There were multiple boxes in the apartment/house that I wouldn't touch. I kept washing my hands compulsively. I didn't allow my boyfriend to touch certain things that I knew were ""dirty.""

At this point he knew I was ""OCD"" but he didn't know why or how serious it was.

**I was barely present in the last 5 years.** I wasted SO much of my time fearing the dirty items and thinking what I can't touch / dreaming about my future house that is completely clean/ hating the noise neighbors/ cars....etc.

I didn't buy flowers/pillows/things I wanted because I felt like the house didn't deserve it, because it was dirty. I didn't watch my favorite TV shows sometimes.

I had to throw out so many stuff, wasting a LOT of money that could have been used for traveling and other wonderful stuff. I threw out a LOT OF clothes, bags, make up, home decor, small furniture...etc.

I hated touching certain things. I did excessive laundry. I had to clean everything. My hand would sometimes bleed from so much hand washing. -&gt; My hands were always my sensitive points. I would look at how dry/red they were and would always be reminded of my ""condition"". I spent a lot of money on high-end hand creams and even more on laundry stuff/soaps/shower gels/cleaning stuff. SO much wasted money.....

Even my poor cats were ""dirty"". ( I still loved and petted them though, I just couldn't shake the thought).

I developed breath holding OCD for certain triggers and I would do small movements with my face, hands, legs and toes as compulsions to certain thoughts.

I couldn't touch the TV remote without having to wash my hands afterwards.

At a certain point, I started hating cars so much for being (noisy and annoying) that I had to loudly cuss at every car that went by my house. After that it was every human being. ( I genuinely don't know how my boyfriend didn't send me to a psych ward or broke up with me.)

Right now I'm at a point, where everything is my house is dirty but I accepted it, because I'm mentally checked out.

I always liked things in my environment **very clean and neat**, but my OCD feelings were stronger and I ended up having a mess in a lot of places in my house. (I didn't want to touch/mix certain areas so things piled up after a while.) 

&amp;#x200B;

This was slowly killing me.

It became beyond exhausting so I just gave up.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate it so much. It's fucking unfair. I didn't do anything to deserve this. I was hurt and abused and then \*I\* have to deal with this mental illness as well. 

Life is fucking unfair.

**But the worst part of it is that there might be a solution and you don't even know it.**

**There WAS a cure/treatment. I just didn't know about it, so I kept suffering.**

There are hundreds of other things, but I can't write everything down. 

I didn't do a LOT of things I could have possibly wanted because of my anxiety and OCD.

(A few years ago I got addicted to smutty manga. I only realize now that I'm addicted. It gave me such a strong sense of happiness and escapism from my life that it was hard not to get hooked on it completely. This was also a bad thing, because reading these became my whole life and I made a lot of decisions that were VERY unhealthy.

Mindless porn does a lot of horrible things to your brain chemistry, please be reasonable with it.)

Now to more symptoms: I hate words that sound like his name/has the same first letter. I have mental compulsions to ""clean them"" from my brain. I hate the things/food the he likes. I can barely go to the places/town that are near the house I was in high school.

(BTW he is now checked in a mental hospital for clinical depression and my mom is thinking about leaving him. My poor little brothers are suffering greatly from their home situation. This is very ironic and cruel because.....)

&amp;#x200B;

**...now.** ***THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART, PLEASE READ!!! ---------------------------------------------------------------***

I'm utterly broken and fucked up in my head. I had a DPDR episode in January after a very stressful period that is closely related my OCD, I completely dissociated and I can't come back to reality.

MY BRAIN COULDN'T HANDLE THE DISCONNECT. I wanted to have a beautiful, clean, lovely HOME and LIFE where I feel safe vs. my ""dirty"", sad home and life without a soul, that reminds me how my life went to shit. ***(Please read the science about this. If there is a big enough gap between your actual NEEDS and between what your reality is for a long enough time, you can actually ""break your brain"". It's very fucking serious.)***

I'm not gonna list the symptoms, but just know it's bad. I'm fucking suffering in hell.

I lost my sense of reality and self. I'm just going for the sake of my loved ones.

There are some utterly f\*cked and unfathomable existential OCD thoughts and loops stuck in my head.

Next to the DPDR symptoms that are torturing me, all day I keep thinking about how I wasted the last 15 years (but mostly 5 years with my boyfriend. I love him so much, this causes me the most suffering.)

It's eating me. I have so many regrets. I wish I could go back, but I can't. 

I'm just so sad, that I didn't ask for help with all of this. My c-ptsd and OCD. And possibly other mental illnesses I have.

**I wish I came across something like this post 5 or 10 years ago. My life would be different now.**

DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID. PLEASE GET HELP. You don't have to live with even 1 OCD thought. It's useless. Find a certified OCD specialist. Do ERP. Make the thoughts quiet. Make the images disappear.

Don't be a bad example like me.

Life is so beautiful with a clear head and . The opportunities are endless.

**OCD IS FULLY TREATABLE SO IT NEVER COMES BACK. And even if it comes back, you can make it 80/90/95%. You can live with that!**

**If you are someone / see someone that is showing signs of OCD (even small ones!!!) please make them read this. THE SOONER YOU START TREATING OCD, THE BETTER.**

***There are even medications and vitamins you can take that work miracles.***

Don't waste even 5 minutes more on this shitty mental illness. Get a therapist. Work through your traumas and do ERP. You will beat this. You CAN beat this.

You deserve a happy, healthy life. You deserve happy, healthy thoughts.

**PLEASE DON'T PROCRASTINATE when it comes to OCD.** It will keep getting nastier. It spreads if you have an anxious mind. DON'T let that happen. 

**Don't go beyond a point of no return.**

This is the first and last time I write this down, so you can learn from my life story and hopefully reverse/PREVENT the damage. PLEASE.

No one deserves OCD, but I believe that all of you can beat it and don't waste your life on this. 

Sending you lots of love and strength. Don't EVER give up. (And please donate to an OCD charity if you can afford to.)

&lt;p&gt;From that point on, it&amp;#39;s just downhill. I couldn&amp;#39;t find my home/peace in any of the apartments (hellish neighbors/car noises...etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started getting angrier and more frustrated with life. Depression was getting worse, but I didn&amp;#39;t realize this because I was too busy thinking about how I hated living everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At some point I felt like everything was contaminated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to keep my groin area clenched as a compulsion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped inviting my brothers over because I didn&amp;#39;t want them to touch anything in the apartment (or sit on the toilet...etc.) - This was also because I was paranoid that he would know our address and come over when I was home alone - there was no chance for this, but I couldn&amp;#39;t shake these feelings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met with my brothers outside somewhere (cinema, park, restaurant...etc.) They didn&amp;#39;t understand why they couldn&amp;#39;t come over. Obviously I couldn&amp;#39;t tell them, so I made up some excuses. I felt like shit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother/family was making everything SO MUCH WORSE in the meanwhile. I cut them off because I couldn&amp;#39;t handle how they didn&amp;#39;t choose my side in all of this. They acted like there was nothing wrong, while still complaining about him behind his back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother kept telling/asking me to forgive him and go back back home to talk. I never told her just how much they ruined my life. But I hated her so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was like she kept turning a knife in my wounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were multiple boxes in the apartment/house that I wouldn&amp;#39;t touch. I kept washing my hands compulsively. I didn&amp;#39;t allow my boyfriend to touch certain things that I knew were &amp;quot;dirty.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point he knew I was &amp;quot;OCD&amp;quot; but he didn&amp;#39;t know why or how serious it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was barely present in the last 5 years.&lt;/strong&gt; I wasted SO much of my time fearing the dirty items and thinking what I can&amp;#39;t touch / dreaming about my future house that is completely clean/ hating the noise neighbors/ cars....etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t buy flowers/pillows/things I wanted because I felt like the house didn&amp;#39;t deserve it, because it was dirty. I didn&amp;#39;t watch my favorite TV shows sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to throw out so many stuff, wasting a LOT of money that could have been used for traveling and other wonderful stuff. I threw out a LOT OF clothes, bags, make up, home decor, small furniture...etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hated touching certain things. I did excessive laundry. I had to clean everything. My hand would sometimes bleed from so much hand washing. -&amp;gt; My hands were always my sensitive points. I would look at how dry/red they were and would always be reminded of my &amp;quot;condition&amp;quot;. I spent a lot of money on high-end hand creams and even more on laundry stuff/soaps/shower gels/cleaning stuff. SO much wasted money.....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even my poor cats were &amp;quot;dirty&amp;quot;. ( I still loved and petted them though, I just couldn&amp;#39;t shake the thought).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I developed breath holding OCD for certain triggers and I would do small movements with my face, hands, legs and toes as compulsions to certain thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t touch the TV remote without having to wash my hands afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a certain point, I started hating cars so much for being (noisy and annoying) that I had to loudly cuss at every car that went by my house. After that it was every human being. ( I genuinely don&amp;#39;t know how my boyfriend didn&amp;#39;t send me to a psych ward or broke up with me.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I&amp;#39;m at a point, where everything is my house is dirty but I accepted it, because I&amp;#39;m mentally checked out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always liked things in my environment &lt;strong&gt;very clean and neat&lt;/strong&gt;, but my OCD feelings were stronger and I ended up having a mess in a lot of places in my house. (I didn&amp;#39;t want to touch/mix certain areas so things piled up after a while.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was slowly killing me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It became beyond exhausting so I just gave up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate it so much. It&amp;#39;s fucking unfair. I didn&amp;#39;t do anything to deserve this. I was hurt and abused and then *I* have to deal with this mental illness as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is fucking unfair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But the worst part of it is that there might be a solution and you don&amp;#39;t even know it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There WAS a cure/treatment. I just didn&amp;#39;t know about it, so I kept suffering.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are hundreds of other things, but I can&amp;#39;t write everything down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t do a LOT of things I could have possibly wanted because of my anxiety and OCD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(A few years ago I got addicted to smutty manga. I only realize now that I&amp;#39;m addicted. It gave me such a strong sense of happiness and escapism from my life that it was hard not to get hooked on it completely. This was also a bad thing, because reading these became my whole life and I made a lot of decisions that were VERY unhealthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mindless porn does a lot of horrible things to your brain chemistry, please be reasonable with it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to more symptoms: I hate words that sound like his name/has the same first letter. I have mental compulsions to &amp;quot;clean them&amp;quot; from my brain. I hate the things/food the he likes. I can barely go to the places/town that are near the house I was in high school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(BTW he is now checked in a mental hospital for clinical depression and my mom is thinking about leaving him. My poor little brothers are suffering greatly from their home situation. This is very ironic and cruel because.....)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;...now.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART, PLEASE READ!!! ---------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m utterly broken and fucked up in my head. I had a DPDR episode in January after a very stressful period that is closely related my OCD, I completely dissociated and I can&amp;#39;t come back to reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MY BRAIN COULDN&amp;#39;T HANDLE THE DISCONNECT. I wanted to have a beautiful, clean, lovely HOME and LIFE where I feel safe vs. my &amp;quot;dirty&amp;quot;, sad home and life without a soul, that reminds me how my life went to shit. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Please read the science about this. If there is a big enough gap between your actual NEEDS and between what your reality is for a long enough time, you can actually &amp;quot;break your brain&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s very fucking serious.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not gonna list the symptoms, but just know it&amp;#39;s bad. I&amp;#39;m fucking suffering in hell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lost my sense of reality and self. I&amp;#39;m just going for the sake of my loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some utterly f*cked and unfathomable existential OCD thoughts and loops stuck in my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next to the DPDR symptoms that are torturing me, all day I keep thinking about how I wasted the last 15 years (but mostly 5 years with my boyfriend. I love him so much, this causes me the most suffering.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s eating me. I have so many regrets. I wish I could go back, but I can&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just so sad, that I didn&amp;#39;t ask for help with all of this. My c-ptsd and OCD. And possibly other mental illnesses I have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wish I came across something like this post 5 or 10 years ago. My life would be different now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DON&amp;#39;T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID. PLEASE GET HELP. You don&amp;#39;t have to live with even 1 OCD thought. It&amp;#39;s useless. Find a certified OCD specialist. Do ERP. Make the thoughts quiet. Make the images disappear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t be a bad example like me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is so beautiful with a clear head and . The opportunities are endless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OCD IS FULLY TREATABLE SO IT NEVER COMES BACK. And even if it comes back, you can make it 80/90/95%. You can live with that!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are someone / see someone that is showing signs of OCD (even small ones!!!) please make them read this. THE SOONER YOU START TREATING OCD, THE BETTER.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are even medications and vitamins you can take that work miracles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t waste even 5 minutes more on this shitty mental illness. Get a therapist. Work through your traumas and do ERP. You will beat this. You CAN beat this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You deserve a happy, healthy life. You deserve happy, healthy thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PLEASE DON&amp;#39;T PROCRASTINATE when it comes to OCD.&lt;/strong&gt; It will keep getting nastier. It spreads if you have an anxious mind. DON&amp;#39;T let that happen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#39;t go beyond a point of no return.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first and last time I write this down, so you can learn from my life story and hopefully reverse/PREVENT the damage. PLEASE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one deserves OCD, but I believe that all of you can beat it and don&amp;#39;t waste your life on this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sending you lots of love and strength. Don&amp;#39;t EVER give up. (And please donate to an OCD charity if you can afford to.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tldr;&lt;/strong&gt; I didn&amp;#39;t know what I had was OCD (among other things),  it ruined my entire life and now it&amp;#39;s too late. Please get help NOW/ spread awareness of OCD so people can get help in time.&lt;/p&gt;

173,,OCD,"You are not your feelings.

People wrongly identify with their feelings. They feel anxious, so they tell themselves a story, ‘I’m anxious, I have anxiety.’ This leads to living a life in which we’re trying to avoid certain feelings or chasing others.

We reach a state of calm. Then we start to think about how to hold on to it. How to stay in this state forever. Then the calm is gone and we’re anxious again. 

Understand: Your feelings are impermanent. You are meant to feel. Emotions exist so that we can feel them, the full range. Happy, sad, bored, discontent.

Stop thinking about your feelings as a permanent state and realize you have the power to change it.

When you think of Mike Tyson, ‘Iron Mike,’ ‘The Baddest Man on the Planet.’ A career record of 50-6, 44 knockouts, arrested more than 30 times before he was 13. You don’t think of someone who felt a lot of fear. 

It’s hard to imagine him [in tears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKjK95aRrhc) before a fight. Pacing around outside crying and overcome by anxiety and fear. Tyson’s trainer and adopted father, Cus D’Amato would say, “The hero and the coward both feel the same thing, but the hero uses his fear.” 

Tyson felt fear, it was a feeling he had. But then he moved forward. After those tears is a fight that was stopped in his favor after about 35 seconds. Thoughts, emotions, feelings. They’re like clouds, they come and go. Not here forever. Not gone forever. 

In ***The Wisdom of Insecurity***, Alan Watts explains that if, “we are to be fully human and fully alive and aware, it seems that we must be willing to suffer for our pleasures.”

If you never want to feel sad. You’ll never feel happy. If you never want to feel anxious, you won’t know contentment. If you’ve never had a bad day, you won’t recognize a great one. The alternative to feeling is numbness. It’s bland, mediocre and average. It’s half alive.

181,,OCD,"Does anyone know if there is a link between Celebrity Worship Syndrome (which is a form of obsessive addiction disorder, I believe I read)  and obsessive compulsive disorder?

I have been diagnosed with OCD but I also tend to go through these weird phases of obsessing over a celebrity or sometimes a subject or something.  

For example, my newest one is Marilyn Manson, I have been obsessively listening to his music and watching interviews with him and I may buy his autobiography book and have been thinking about his music, voice, personality, makeup, the allegations against him and stuff.  I've experienced this before with other celebrities as well.  When I was younger I had it REALLY bad when I was about 12 over some dude from CSI: Miami. Lol.

Thankfully now mine usually go through shorter phases.  

It also is sometimes a subject or movie like.. recently I had an obsession with Titanic the movie and literally would keep watching it over and over again and then started to read about the actual Titanic and books about it and stuff.

195,,OCD,"I forgot something hugely important today, basically it was an assignment where I had to critique someone else's work.

I forgot it completely, I knew it was going to happen last week, and I forgot it.

I know that it's because of ADHD, I know it's not that important in life, but I feel like I just killed someone.

I mean, this is someone else's art, their work that they put time and effort into and they loved and it was clearly so important to them. I wanted to say things about it, I wanted to discuss it, but I fucking forgot. I killed their time and when I apologized they said that it was cool and thanked me?

How? How the fuck can they just blow this off, how the fuck? I'm a fucking horrible, narcissistic piece of shit, I treated their work like it wasn't worth the ten minutes of time it would take to me to read and write a solid critique, and they just say that it's fine?

I know that the reason I'm writing this is becuase my OCD is seeking reassurance, or maybe punishment. I know that the only reason I could ever actually be this sorry is because I really just want to excuse this on my mental illnesses and shove the responsibility onto my broken brain. I am not this genuine, no one is, and I know that by even saying this it's just me begging for someone to say that I am.

So why the fuck is it that the only time in the past two years that I've been able to cry over anything has been when I fucked something up for someone? I genuinely feel so horrible, it just proves why I need OCD, so that I can be punished for the weight of how horrible I am. I need my brain to keep hurting me, because I keep hurting other people through blind ignorance and stupidity. I need OCD to keep me in check, because I just wander through life, without a care in the world, and fuck everything up around me unless I am managed. I need this mental illness to manage me, to make sure that I never hurt anyone like this again.

I'm utterly fucked up, and everyone else is so fucking beautiful. They're all so creative, wonderful, kind, thoughtful. They truly are, in so many ways, perfect. But I keep ruining things for them, conversations, art, time, I take it all and rape it with my shitty shitty brain.

I don't even know what this is anymore. Public flagellation or attention seeking or whatever. But I just want to say something.

I wanted to say things about it, I wanted to discuss it, but I fucking forgot. I killed their time and when I apologized they said that it was cool and thanked me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How? How the fuck can they just blow this off, how the fuck? I&amp;#39;m a fucking horrible, narcissistic piece of shit, I treated their work like it wasn&amp;#39;t worth the ten minutes of time it would take to me to read and write a solid critique, and they just say that it&amp;#39;s fine?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that the reason I&amp;#39;m writing this is becuase my OCD is seeking reassurance, or maybe punishment. I know that the only reason I could ever actually be this sorry is because I really just want to excuse this on my mental illnesses and shove the responsibility onto my broken brain. I am not this genuine, no one is, and I know that by even saying this it&amp;#39;s just me begging for someone to say that I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why the fuck is it that the only time in the past two years that I&amp;#39;ve been able to cry over anything has been when I fucked something up for someone? I genuinely feel so horrible, it just proves why I need OCD, so that I can be punished for the weight of how horrible I am. I need my brain to keep hurting me, because I keep hurting other people through blind ignorance and stupidity. I need OCD to keep me in check, because I just wander through life, without a care in the world, and fuck everything up around me unless I am managed. I need this mental illness to manage me, to make sure that I never hurt anyone like this again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m utterly fucked up, and everyone else is so fucking beautiful. They&amp;#39;re all so creative, wonderful, kind, thoughtful. They truly are, in so many ways, perfect. But I keep ruining things for them, conversations, art, time, I take it all and rape it with my shitty shitty brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t even know what this is anymore. Public flagellation or attention seeking or whatever. But I just want to say something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I could just be a human being with a good brain that helped people. I always wish I was them, but instead I&amp;#39;m me.&lt;/p&gt;

199,,OCD,"Uncertain Life &gt;&gt; A Song By Me

This uncertain life, I need to get used to uncertain life,

To put it in terms that a person can understand,

It's a lifestyle that prides itself on uncertainness,

That means not knowing in terms of emotions ex-actly,

If what you're feeling is worth demand,

Those without issues might not get the memo,

So let's put it into economic terms again,

&amp;#x200B;

It's like not having a job and not knowing where your next paycheck is,

Rationally, to find certainty, you'd try to get hired for paying shifts,

But you can't do it, cause you'll get fired soon, and be back ruminating,

So to counteract the effects, you stay unemployed

Without a clue as to how to make ends meet,

And you sit there, doing whatever you please, you were afraid to buy a car,

Because you didn't have the money to cover such high a charge,

But you take out the loan with no intent to work to supply the cost,

You don't have the cash, but you buy the car,

Likely causing worries as to how you'll pay for the car,

Brain keeps saying to go work a job, you say nah,

And go buy a plane, fly the plane, deny your brain,

Your brain saying to combine your change

Or get a job at least, To provide sustainment,

You say no, and go buy a boat,

&amp;#x200B;

The uncertain life, it's the kind of hard-working life, that rich people have,

Where you don't need to work,

You keep relaxation and complacency w thoughts,

&amp;#x200B;

The uncertain life, why did I decide on the uncertain life?

Cause prior to this, I had lived a worthless life,

Went from a pray and worship life to a tell others to pray and worship life,

Spent all day checking to make sure my actions hadn't led to a person dying,

A compulsion life, a can't walk next to minors cause my mind wants me to

touch the child,

A scrupulosity life, a religious focused life, a guilty confession controlling life,

A depressed injured and hurting life,

all-cause I was too interested in living the certain life,

A quote on quote perfect life, then I saw the worldly life,

A push to decide before maturity what kind of course in life,

Get the joke? My whole life for college courses time,

Get a job, provide security and a sureness life,

Girls never liked me, short king life,

Till one girl and I can't be certain I like her cause my

Perverted mind? But maybe second-hand benefits,

Aren't all worthless highs,

Maybe the uncertain life can help me to figure out the hurt in life,

And OCD led me to a philosophy of the perfect kind,

And I ain't even sure the uncertain life is the preferred life,

But it's mine so long as I wish to stop my burning mind,

My burdens climb so long as I strive for a certain life,

So goodbye, and say hi, to the uncertain life.",t2_6cbznly9,False,,0,False,Uncertain Life &gt;&gt; A Song,[],r/OCD,False,0,,0,,False,t3_m1bl32,False,dark,1.0,,public,4,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Art,False,4,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1615340008.0,text,0,,,text,self.OCD,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uncertain Life &amp;gt;&amp;gt; A Song By Me&lt;/p&gt;

- It is possible to just stop compulsions and it takes humongous effort. I was knackered by about 8pm, and could barely stay awake. I’m assuming this was mental exhaustion.

203,,OCD,"Hey there, I hate how I sound like a drug addict desperately clinging onto a psychoactive substance, but hopefully knowing how severe OCD can be you can understand where I am coming from.

I suffered with severe anxiety and pure O OCD my entire life, in fact at one point I became agoraphobic due to fear of potentially harming others. Whenever I heard a high profile crime had happened I’d instantly wonder if I had commited it myself. Furthermore I have also dealt with false memories, extreme hypochondriasis and severe performance anxiety that almost got me dropping out of school. 

About two years ago my family and I decided it was time to look into pharmacological help. At first I was prescribed Lexapro, which didn’t work and gave me bad anhedonia and avolition so I had to switch to Zoloft. I’ve been taking it for about a year at 200mg and it works amazingly both for my OCD as well as my depressive tendencies. For the first time in my life I have been happy and can see the irrationality of my intrusive thoughts. 

However, my psychiatrist thinks it’s time to start tapering off and has lowered my dosage to 150mg instead and wants me to be off medication by the summer. When she first said so I didn’t think much of it considering I feel okay right now, but the truth is this dosage decrease for the past 12 days has shown me that the Zoloft is the very reason I am okay. Don’t get me wrong, I have benefited a lot from therapy and have more coping mechanisms now than I had two years ago, but the real game changer and anti-obsessional force has indeed been fhe Zoloft.

I know it’s not up to me to decide and I should trust my therapist, but I really really want to keep taking it. On Zoloft at least I have some quality of life. I barely have any side effects and it’s working so well. She said most people normally took it for 1-2 years, but what harm could there be in being on it for longer? Of course I know that I can obviously go back on medication, but what if it doesnt work the second time around or even if it does why do I have to go through the whole tapering up process again?

Has anyone else been on long-term medication?",t2_kq73s6l,False,,0,False,My doctor wants me to start tapering off my Zoloft but I don’t want to,[],r/OCD,False,0,,0,,False,t3_m1kd0u,False,light,1.0,#dadada,public,1,0,{},af40d60a-2d79-11e6-bb59-0eed8172e961,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion,False,1,,False,,False,Pure-O ,[],{},,True,,1615363928.0,text,0,,,text,self.OCD,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey there, I hate how I sound like a drug addict desperately clinging onto a psychoactive substance, but hopefully knowing how severe OCD can be you can understand where I am coming from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suffered with severe anxiety and pure O OCD my entire life, in fact at one point I became agoraphobic due to fear of potentially harming others. Whenever I heard a high profile crime had happened I’d instantly wonder if I had commited it myself. Furthermore I have also dealt with false memories, extreme hypochondriasis and severe performance anxiety that almost got me dropping out of school. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About two years ago my family and I decided it was time to look into pharmacological help. At first I was prescribed Lexapro, which didn’t work and gave me bad anhedonia and avolition so I had to switch to Zoloft. I’ve been taking it for about a year at 200mg and it works amazingly both for my OCD as well as my depressive tendencies. For the first time in my life I have been happy and can see the irrationality of my intrusive thoughts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, my psychiatrist thinks it’s time to start tapering off and has lowered my dosage to 150mg instead and wants me to be off medication by the summer. When she first said so I didn’t think much of it considering I feel okay right now, but the truth is this dosage decrease for the past 12 days has shown me that the Zoloft is the very reason I am okay. Don’t get me wrong, I have benefited a lot from therapy and have more coping mechanisms now than I had two years ago, but the real game changer and anti-obsessional force has indeed been fhe Zoloft.&lt;/p&gt;

222,,OCD,"Hey all, so I think I may have made a post about this before but I honestly can’t remember. I’ve had what I thought is OCD and definitely anxiety for a while now, (haven’t got tested for ocd)and I think it started shortly before or after my mother died a few years ago. I’ve had many different obsessions, some include:

Fear of violence: I would have intrusive thoughts and ruminate about hurting people, usually loved ones in violent manners, this has seemingly gone away but usually my obsessions come and go 

Fear of being homosexual: I would worry and have intrusive thoughts about being attracted to the opposite sex, and often check to make sure I wasn’t. This one was the least difficult to deal with I would say, as if I saw an attractive woman I’d feel less inclined to give into these thoughts. I don’t have anything against people with different sexual attractions, nor is it my fear. it’s just a fear I have of my OWN sexuality.

Fear of being a pedophile: I would worry and have intrusive thoughts about being attracted to children, though I’d never do something like this once again it’s something that was intrusive and wouldn’t leave me alone. This was very stressful to deal with and made me feel evil. I remember one time I had to bathe my baby cousin and I was uncomfortable because those thoughts kept pinging me in my mind, but nonetheless I was fine and didn’t worry about it as I was doing so.

Obsession with looks: I’m obsessed with facial features and attractions, whenever I see a person that has a feature I think is attractive, I think to myself “why couldn’t I look like that?” As well as many other things, I think about how long their chin is, how far apart their eyes are, cheekbones etc.

A big one I struggle with *CURRENTLY*, is cleaning/contamination OCD: since the pandemic has started, I’ve been extra cautious about covid and sanitation. Previously I didn’t care as much, but now every time we leave the house and come back, I whipe my phone and keys and other things. This sounds normal, but then it transitions into me whiping everything I brush my jacket on while walking past, spraying everything my body may have touched. If I touch a tiny part of my skin on a doorknob without washing my hands or showering prior to returning home, or something of that sort, I’ll spray my skin (which can’t be good for me), and whatever I touched.. I spray after myself every time I do laundry and put my dirty clothes in there. My father does not take covid seriously, so every time he comes home I whipe down everything he’s touched, and it leads to me washing my hands definitely 20+ times a day, definitely more than that. My hands quite literally look like alligator skin, and are are cracked, chafed, and very dry. I put lotion on but this doesn’t help when you keep removing it by washing over 20 times. and I’m also afraid of my own bodily fluids. Anytime I use the bathroom, I have to whipe everything that I’ve touched, and sometimes things I haven’t touched just to make sure that I don’t “infect” my sisters with urine that also use the bathroom, as well as myself. It sometimes takes and hour + to disinfect to my satisfaction, and this annoys my sisters as they have to hunt for whipes and disinfectants, I usually pay for them and if I could drive (I don’t have a license yet,), I would pick them up myself rather than cashapping them everytime, as if would make me feel a lot better. I feel bad for doing this, but I would spend all day worrying if I did not. Just yesterday, I had felt like the top of my dresser was contaminated, and I touched it. I tried to resist the urge to disinfect my whole room, and I had been anxious all day worrying if I caught covid when in reality I’ll most likely be fine. I’m worried about infecting others as well as myself when it comes to covid. 

Pregnancy OCD: I’m a teenager, so I masturbate. I’m not ashamed of it, but every time I do this, I wash my hands more than once, sometimes up to four times, even if I don’t get anything on my hands. and I whipe down everything I touch (again, some things I haven’t touched), and spray them as there are women in the house and while I know it’s technically impossible for them to, I’m afraid that my sperm can get them pregnant. If I do not properly sanitize, I spend days, sometimes weeks worrying about things like. “Are they acting weird now all of a sudden?”, “did I get any on my hands?”, “I’m pretty sure it had been 30 or so minutes, so no sperm can survive.” This has occurred around the same time as my contamination ocd and it may go hand in hand I’m not sure.  The semen itself does not scare me, but infecting other people with it does. 

I also repeat phrases over periodically throughout the day in my head: I repeat certain things I hear, or things I say in my mind. This doesn’t affect me negatively I don’t think, but it’s annoying and I wish it would stop. It’s just odd to be going about my day and then hear some random word I keep repeating again, it’s ridiculous.

I’m also obsessed with music and the artists that make it: I’ve always loved music, and when I learn of an artist that I really like, I research everything I can about them. I’ve recently (over this year) started listening to Michael Jackson (along with the Jackson 5), Marvin Gaye, 2pac, Jim Morrison (the doors), and these are mostly what I focus on. I know things like certain events they went to, etc just a whole bunch of unimportant things that I find cool. I’ve watched Michael Jackson dance, and I mimic his dance moves a lot. I have many songs by each. I often listen to their songs on repeat, and identify little new sounds I hear each time I listen. These artists that I like I often find that I identify with a lot. For instance, Marvin Gaye, Jim Morrison and  Michael Jackson did not have a strong relationship with their fathers, neither do I and perhaps that is part of the reason why I gravitate towards them. I do like music a lot and listen to a lot of genres, mostly older stuff, 60’s-2000’s, reggae, soul, disco, rock/blues, r&amp;b, but I like a lot of rap and new age pop also.



I’ve also struggled with anger issues in the past after my mom died, but I don’t have this issue anymore. I would hit and break things and scream but luckily that shit is over with, as I was not in the position to replace any of it.

I’m also usually very stressed and anxious. I’m anxious whenever I have to go somewhere with people, but the minute I get there and see them I’m lively and energized and I more than usually have a lot of fun. I hesitated to call it social anxiety, seeing as how once I’m around people I’m no longer anxious, but maybe the anxiety is the buildup to getting there rather than actually talking to them. I’ve never been the awkward type and I get along with people well.

I’m often very self-critical, about the way I look and how other people perceive me. I often criticize myself but this may be more of a teenage confidence issue.

Other than all of this, I’m a pretty normal kid for my age. I got a good set of friends, my sisters basically step up as parents, and they do a better job than my parents did. I do well In school, and I’m just tryna be the best me I can. I feel like the outside me is normal to other people, when the inner me is troubled. Honestly idk, I’m just tired af. I want it all to end. My sisters are constantly upset with me solely because I use too much disinfectant, I pay for it but they hate hunting for it at stores as it’s often difficult to find. That’s my main problem right now is contamination, but the other problems are there also. I’ve never gotten tested, or medicated and my family said that I don’t need to. I’m pretty sure one of my sisters has it also, and we’re almost IDENTICAL in just about everything we like/humor/taste etc. she usually tells me that I just need to work on it, but I don’t know how.

Anyways, this was all just a rant/cry for help and I hope someone has tips for anything I’ve said above.

It sometimes takes and hour + to disinfect to my satisfaction, and this annoys my sisters as they have to hunt for whipes and disinfectants, I usually pay for them and if I could drive (I don’t have a license yet,), I would pick them up myself rather than cashapping them everytime, as if would make me feel a lot better. I feel bad for doing this, but I would spend all day worrying if I did not. Just yesterday, I had felt like the top of my dresser was contaminated, and I touched it. I tried to resist the urge to disinfect my whole room, and I had been anxious all day worrying if I caught covid when in reality I’ll most likely be fine. I’m worried about infecting others as well as myself when it comes to covid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pregnancy OCD: I’m a teenager, so I masturbate. I’m not ashamed of it, but every time I do this, I wash my hands more than once, sometimes up to four times, even if I don’t get anything on my hands. and I whipe down everything I touch (again, some things I haven’t touched), and spray them as there are women in the house and while I know it’s technically impossible for them to, I’m afraid that my sperm can get them pregnant. If I do not properly sanitize, I spend days, sometimes weeks worrying about things like. “Are they acting weird now all of a sudden?”, “did I get any on my hands?”, “I’m pretty sure it had been 30 or so minutes, so no sperm can survive.” This has occurred around the same time as my contamination ocd and it may go hand in hand I’m not sure.  The semen itself does not scare me, but infecting other people with it does. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also repeat phrases over periodically throughout the day in my head: I repeat certain things I hear, or things I say in my mind. This doesn’t affect me negatively I don’t think, but it’s annoying and I wish it would stop. It’s just odd to be going about my day and then hear some random word I keep repeating again, it’s ridiculous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also obsessed with music and the artists that make it: I’ve always loved music, and when I learn of an artist that I really like, I research everything I can about them. I’ve recently (over this year) started listening to Michael Jackson (along with the Jackson 5), Marvin Gaye, 2pac, Jim Morrison (the doors), and these are mostly what I focus on. I know things like certain events they went to, etc just a whole bunch of unimportant things that I find cool. I’ve watched Michael Jackson dance, and I mimic his dance moves a lot. I have many songs by each. I often listen to their songs on repeat, and identify little new sounds I hear each time I listen. These artists that I like I often find that I identify with a lot. For instance, Marvin Gaye, Jim Morrison and  Michael Jackson did not have a strong relationship with their fathers, neither do I and perhaps that is part of the reason why I gravitate towards them. I do like music a lot and listen to a lot of genres, mostly older stuff, 60’s-2000’s, reggae, soul, disco, rock/blues, r&amp;amp;b, but I like a lot of rap and new age pop also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also struggled with anger issues in the past after my mom died, but I don’t have this issue anymore. I would hit and break things and scream but luckily that shit is over with, as I was not in the position to replace any of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also usually very stressed and anxious. I’m anxious whenever I have to go somewhere with people, but the minute I get there and see them I’m lively and energized and I more than usually have a lot of fun. I hesitated to call it social anxiety, seeing as how once I’m around people I’m no longer anxious, but maybe the anxiety is the buildup to getting there rather than actually talking to them. I’ve never been the awkward type and I get along with people well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m often very self-critical, about the way I look and how other people perceive me. I often criticize myself but this may be more of a teenage confidence issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than all of this, I’m a pretty normal kid for my age. I got a good set of friends, my sisters basically step up as parents, and they do a better job than my parents did. I do well In school, and I’m just tryna be the best me I can. I feel like the outside me is normal to other people, when the inner me is troubled. Honestly idk, I’m just tired af. I want it all to end. My sisters are constantly upset with me solely because I use too much disinfectant, I pay for it but they hate hunting for it at stores as it’s often difficult to find. That’s my main problem right now is contamination, but the other problems are there also. I’ve never gotten tested, or medicated and my family said that I don’t need to. I’m pretty sure one of my sisters has it also, and we’re almost IDENTICAL in just about everything we like/humor/taste etc. she usually tells me that I just need to work on it, but I don’t know how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, this was all just a rant/cry for help and I hope someone has tips for anything I’ve said above. I’m sure I’ve left stuff out but honestly fuck it Bc this shit took way too damn long to write lmao. I’d love to hear what y’all have to say.&lt;/p&gt;

229,,OCD,"Before OCD, I was relaxed. I didn't care about so much. I lived just like everyone else.

I accepted uncertainty. I lived with questions. Some even had me curious.

Now I feel like a toddler. The simplest things give me anxiety like studying, improving myself, reading, work etc. I start asking myself questions and get completely stressed out. I deal with a lot of existential and moral OCD.

I don't really work anymore. I haven't studied for months. I hide and play games or watch TV inside to avoid life. To avoid responsibility. To avoid even the things I used to love to do. Please believe me, I don't want to. I do it to hide from the world. To protect myself from myself.

I fantasize about death a lot. I'm not planning on killing myself but I think about it A LOT. I'm **not** suicidal but I just really look forward to my life ending. The blankness. The peace.

I don't want children a family or a gf. I'm not even close to being able to be ok with that.

However, I don't want anyone to think you can't have those things with OCD. You **absolutely** can and if that's what you want I'm really happy for you. I really really am. It's just not for me. I don't want it to be.

I didn&amp;#39;t care about so much. I lived just like everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I accepted uncertainty. I lived with questions. Some even had me curious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I feel like a toddler. The simplest things give me anxiety like studying, improving myself, reading, work etc. I start asking myself questions and get completely stressed out. I deal with a lot of existential and moral OCD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t really work anymore. I haven&amp;#39;t studied for months. I hide and play games or watch TV inside to avoid life. To avoid responsibility. To avoid even the things I used to love to do. Please believe me, I don&amp;#39;t want to. I do it to hide from the world. To protect myself from myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fantasize about death a lot. I&amp;#39;m not planning on killing myself but I think about it A LOT. I&amp;#39;m &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; suicidal but I just really look forward to my life ending. The blankness. The peace. The carelessness. I almost crave it. However I have no plans to kill myself and I don&amp;#39;t want anyone to think I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want children a family or a gf. I&amp;#39;m not even close to being able to be ok with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I don&amp;#39;t want anyone to think you can&amp;#39;t have those things with OCD.

238,,OCD,"I’ve pondered for a while that I may have ADHD. I went to the doctor and he asked some basic questions and quickly ruled it out, but I know I’m not what people see as ‘normal’.

Let me delve into this a bit deeper and explain how my brain works...
So this is something I’ve been having a tough time with all my life, I’m fully aware I do these things but I CANNOT stop my mind ticking wildly. I find a new hobby or a new subject or a new movie saga or franchise and I OBSESS! I’m 25, almost 26 and my most recent obsession is subscription boxer shorts ‍♂️, my last obsession was powdered energy drinks. I find something I like and my brain wants as much of it as I can get. I used to collect lightsabers and pop vinyls and then one day my mind is clear and I no longer want them. I sell up. I find something else I invest my everything into and then I just one day no longer care. I built my own pc and I was obsessed with making it look pretty and putting rgb everywhere, then my friend got a gaming laptop and I’ve needed a laptop for work, so I sold my pride and joy pc and bought a gaming laptop. It’s tiring. I was getting something delivered and cause it didn’t come next day like it was supposed to, I phoned the courier over 15 times on different days to try and get it sooner even though every time I rang, they told me it won’t be possible.

I’m currently taking sertraline for my depression, I lost my brother to suicide and I don’t have a great relationship with my family cause I think they didn’t understand me growing up. I’m quite bright and I always have been as I focus so hard at certain things but I throw it away cause I lose focus eventually. I often get called a wind up, because I can be a handful, but its because I bounce off the walls sometimes. 

I’m irrational when it comes to spending money. I buy things I know I don’t want or need, just to complete the set when I own a part of it, and I’m so satisfied once I’ve got it all, or more so when I almost have it all. Then once I have it, I just don’t care anymore.

I’ve been told it’s called hyper focus and it’s a symptom of ADHD-PI but I just need to know what is making me crazy. It’s putting a strain on my life and it’s making it hard for my fiancée and son at times (she is super patient with me and she is completely understanding, I just want to be better for her).",t2_6jqbympx,False,,0,False,I thought I may have ADHD but someone a dr said it sounds more like OCD,[],r/OCD,False,0,,0,,False,t3_m16gvx,False,light,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1615325610.0,text,0,,,text,self.OCD,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve pondered for a while that I may have ADHD.

So this is something I’ve been having a tough time with all my life, I’m fully aware I do these things but I CANNOT stop my mind ticking wildly. I find a new hobby or a new subject or a new movie saga or franchise and I OBSESS! I’m 25, almost 26 and my most recent obsession is subscription boxer shorts ‍♂️, my last obsession was powdered energy drinks. I find something I like and my brain wants as much of it as I can get. I used to collect lightsabers and pop vinyls and then one day my mind is clear and I no longer want them. I sell up. I find something else I invest my everything into and then I just one day no longer care. I built my own pc and I was obsessed with making it look pretty and putting rgb everywhere, then my friend got a gaming laptop and I’ve needed a laptop for work, so I sold my pride and joy pc and bought a gaming laptop. It’s tiring. I was getting something delivered and cause it didn’t come next day like it was supposed to, I phoned the courier over 15 times on different days to try and get it sooner even though every time I rang, they told me it won’t be possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m currently taking sertraline for my depression, I lost my brother to suicide and I don’t have a great relationship with my family cause I think they didn’t understand me growing up. I’m quite bright and I always have been as I focus so hard at certain things but I throw it away cause I lose focus eventually. I often get called a wind up, because I can be a handful, but its because I bounce off the walls sometimes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m irrational when it comes to spending money. I buy things I know I don’t want or need, just to complete the set when I own a part of it, and I’m so satisfied once I’ve got it all, or more so when I almost have it all. Then once I have it, I just don’t care anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been told it’s called hyper focus and it’s a symptom of ADHD-PI but I just need to know what is making me crazy. It’s putting a strain on my life and it’s making it hard for my fiancée and son at times (she is super patient with me and she is completely understanding, I just want to be better for her).&lt;/p&gt;

239,,OCD,"My (32F)partner (28M)was in multiple relationships where he cheated on the person he was with, more specifically with one person.

241,,OCD,"I'm not talking about themes here. I've known that OCD exists for a while, but in the past few years I've been experiencing thought patterns that seem a lot like OCD to me. I've been thinking whether there may have also been some signs in my past, or if maybe what I'm experiencing is something different.

Even as a child there would be specific things that I would have to have a certain way. At some point I started experiencing this desire for tactile symmetry. If I stepped on something with one foot, I would have to step on a similar thing with the other foot, if tapped my left hand fingers on my arm, I would have to do the mirror thing as well. If I touch something with one finger, I also have to touch it with all of the other fingers. I'm no expert on OCD,and from what I often read, it seems that those compulsions or rituals are driven by specific fears? For example ""if I don't do x in this specific way then x will happen"", but I don't have that. It's just a feeling that it has to be like that, I have to have it like this or else I will go out of my mind.

There are other situations where I do experience the ""I have to do x or else y"", even if they're not really correlated, but I'm curios about these other times, when I feel the need to have things that particular way or else I won't be able to go on and there isn't a fear of something specific happening.

248,,OCD,"I'm at a loss. I have no idea what to do anymore.


My fiance and I have struggled with our mental health this past year, partly due to having a baby and Covid lockdown. We've barely been outside in months and it wrecked havoc on our wellbeing. 


Things hit rock bottom last week when my fiance told me he's been struggling with his OCD for the first time in years. Our internet dropped when he was looking at porn and we've been having issues with it ever since, and because he's under a lot of stress he's convinced himself that people are watching him and his phone is listening to everything he says, so thinks that our internet provider has stopped our connection as they think he's a monster.
He got so worked up over it that he was having panic attacks and non-stop crying for eight hours straight, saying he's terrified he's going to be taken away, until I called his mum and we moved back to hers. We've been staying with her ever since.

He's still convinced that he's going to be taken away. I've tried explaining to him that most people our age watch porn, that doesn't make him a monster or a bad person, it wasn't like he was watching anything illegal. Even though he understands this, he says his OCD is giving him this horrid paranoia and these thoughts won't stop.

I don't know what to do. He can't sleep or eat, he's crying all the time, having panic attacks, and his OCD gets really bad when he's on Instagram because he has to follow lots and lots of pages just to unfollow them straight away. I've tried my absolute best to support him and talk some sense into him, but I struggle with depression/anxiety/PTSD/anorexia myself and rely on him A LOT so now I'm starting to feel like I'm about to have a breakdown too.

&amp;#x200B;

So last night, I was coming inside for dinner and a member of my family was wearing something less than conservative and walking around. I was walking up the path and my anxiety started going, and when I walked into the house I looked the direction they were walking, and then I think I immediately stopped myself and then sat down, immediately worrying and worrying that I was attracted to this person.

I know I've had problems before where my brain has said 'dont look at, dont look at that, dont look at that', and then I've looked out of impulse, and I don't really remember feeling any attraction etc.

I'm really not 100% sure what's going on or what happened, but there's this little voice in my head that tells me that this time it was a bit different and I wanted to look at them inappropriately, even for a second.

The thought came into my head I’d say about last summer and I think about it every day. I was born in 2005, I know a lot of people who were born a year before in 2004. For some reason I have gotten a random jealousy because of the year they were born. Like I’ll see something that came out in 2004 like let’s say the Adam Sandler movie 50 First Dates. I absolutely love the movie but some voice in my head tells me “they were alive when this came out and you weren’t”. I think of it as childish and stupid but it won’t go away. It’s even gotten to the year they started school for some odd reason, like 2010 or 2009, I’ll see something else that happened then like another movie for example, Scott Pilgrim vs the World which is my all-time favorite movie, that came out in the Summer of 2010.

So with those two on top of one another, somehow it’s gotten to any year I think of has that same thought “yeah well they were already in high school when this came out and you weren’t” “they we’re halfway through middle school while you’re stuck in the fifth grade” and so on.

I'm 16 and I've had intrusive thoughts about children for two months now.
In the beginning i had a bunch of anxiety to the point where i would sometimes start disassociating and all the thoughts disgusted me. But gradually the anxiety and disgust went down.

Now two months later. I'm currently on 50mg setraline a day and on a waiting list for help with an ocd specialist.
Lately I've developed kind of a porn addiction and have been masturbating 3 to 5 times a day for about 3 weeks.
I also do a bunch checking compulsion. I will imagine myself having sex with someone my age and then someone underage to check for arousal, and also the other way around. And I'll look up pictures of someone underage and someone my age to check for attraction.

3 or 4 days ago i was on this girl's instagram page who i find very attractive. (She's also 16) I had been on her page earlier the same day i believe and, had masturbated to a few pics of her. Anyway, i was on her page again and doing my thing and i noticed that she recently had posted a few pics of her as a child. I was already aroused because i was masturbating and decided to do a checking compulsion. So i looked at a pic of her as a child and masturbated while imagining having sex with her. (Yeah i know gross) and i came very close to climaxing so i stopped. It was chocking how fast i almost came compared to the usual stuff i had been masturbating too. After i almost came i went back to the other pics of her as a teen, but after a while (I DON'T REMEMBER AT ALL WHY, I DON'T REMEMBER MY MIND SET) i went back to the picture of her as a child, did the same thing and finished. I don't understand why i did, i am so confused. I felt guilty afterwards but it didn't fully hit until later and i started crying hysterically.

I've always liked girls my age!! I've had multiple crushes and multiple sexual fantasies about girls I've liked!! I don't understand why i did this. It's so far detached from the person i am ,or at least used to be before this started. I've never thought of a child in any sexual way before this started and would never ever EVER hurt a child!! I just feel like I've permanently stained my self image.
What does this mean?? I am so confused. Ever since then I've decided to stop watching porn because i think it has majorly desensitized me to women. I've also since then refused to do any checking compulsion but the intrusive thoughts still bother me. 
I can't believe i did that and it grosses me out remembering i did that. Honestly wtf.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always liked girls my age!! I&amp;#39;ve had multiple crushes and multiple sexual fantasies about girls I&amp;#39;ve liked!! I don&amp;#39;t understand why i did this. It&amp;#39;s so far detached from the person i am ,or at least used to be before this started. I&amp;#39;ve never thought of a child in any sexual way before this started and would never ever EVER hurt a child!! I just feel like I&amp;#39;ve permanently stained my self image.
What does this mean?? I am so confused. Ever since then I&amp;#39;ve decided to stop watching porn because i think it has majorly desensitized me to women. I&amp;#39;ve also since then refused to do any checking compulsion but the intrusive thoughts still bother me. 
I can&amp;#39;t believe i did that and it grosses me out remembering i did that. Honestly wtf.
I still really hope this is pocd because it definitely was in the beginning but now I&amp;#39;m not sure. Has anyone else had a similar experience when the attraction feels extremely real??&lt;/p&gt;

305,,OCD,"Hi! I was talking to a friend who was recently diagnosed with OCD and was prescribed Prozac...I've been thinking about going on medication the past couple years to treat my anxiety/depression but after talking to my friend I'm wondering if what I actually have is OCD. I struggle with symptoms like intrusive and unwanted thoughts that cause intense anxiety and distress because I ruminate and obsess over them. Oftentimes they are health related fears or fears of doing something out of character or a general mistrust of myself and my feelings towards things. Even when I logically know the feeling is wrong, these thoughts can spiral out of control and feel extremely overwhelming and dire. The thoughts really destabilize my mood and can be debilitating and affect my ability to be present.

I also partake in behaviors such as obsessive body picking...picking at my skin or hair for example. Sometimes I don't even realize I'm doing it for a while but it gives me a feeling of momentary release or calm. 

Anyways, I'm wondering if anyone else suffers from similar symptoms and have you tried medicating? If so, how have your symptoms changed by taking meds?

I was talking to a friend who was recently diagnosed with OCD and was prescribed Prozac...I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about going on medication the past couple years to treat my anxiety/depression but after talking to my friend I&amp;#39;m wondering if what I actually have is OCD. I struggle with symptoms like intrusive and unwanted thoughts that cause intense anxiety and distress because I ruminate and obsess over them. Oftentimes they are health related fears or fears of doing something out of character or a general mistrust of myself and my feelings towards things. Even when I logically know the feeling is wrong, these thoughts can spiral out of control and feel extremely overwhelming and dire. The thoughts really destabilize my mood and can be debilitating and affect my ability to be present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also partake in behaviors such as obsessive body picking...picking at my skin or hair for example. Sometimes I don&amp;#39;t even realize I&amp;#39;m doing it for a while but it gives me a feeling of momentary release or calm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I&amp;#39;m wondering if anyone else suffers from similar symptoms and have you tried medicating? If so, how have your symptoms changed by taking meds? I also just want to feel less alone so any personal stories or encouragement will go a long way. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

306,,OCD,"Hello everyone, this is one of many posts that I've been writing lately here on reddit, the main reason is that I feel that I can't believe myself and rely only on other people to tell me who I am supposed to be. You see I've been trans for almost 7 months now but for about a month I am struggling with crippling self-doubt to the point where I can't function properly. I remember when I started being trans it felt right, sure the dysphoria was really strong and all but at least I had hope for a better future, that all ended when the doubt came. I feel dysphoria - ""it's all fake""/""you are simply confused""/""you're making this up"", I don't feel dysphoria - ""It was all fake""/""See? You're fine"" and so on. I've explored every possible explanation, everything but I can't stop going in circles thinking about the same sign again and again and again. Sometimes it seems to stop for a second, give me some space, let me breathe and then it just starts again with the same force.

Like it doesn't matter what I wanted because I'm so lost that everything lost it's meaning, my emotions seem all faked by something inside of my brain. Sometimes I feel like I have some kind of OCD, other times I think that I can't have OCD and I'm using that to have some sort of excuse and then I think that is also an excuse and I just don't know anymore.

So this is a thought I had, I feel like a psycho but it makes sense to me. So people carry knifes and guns for self protection correct? So is it wrong for a kid to have a knife or gun for protection? Weapons should never be in school at all but I’m saying if they were it shows people who pick on younger kids that they have a way to fight back IF needed.

And if they WERE threatened they have a way to fight (as in shoot or stab them in the leg). Like I said killing is never justified in that area and weapons shouldn’t be in school. But if it was does that make me a bad lesson to think it’s justifiable to have kids carry something for self control? And if people end up harming them they can use it by stabbing or shooting in the leg? I feel like an evil person but in all reality it’s no different then women carrying guns.

I’m pretty sure it was just because I was a horny teen and anything sexual was good enough to jack off to, in my eyes. I don’t think I was actually attracted to the animals.

I stopped, and haven’t done anything of the sort since (I’m 19 now).

The other day, I decided to watch a funny video compilation of dogs humping stuff to see if I felt anything. I figured that was a good way to test, you know? And I didn’t feel anything, aside from perhaps a mild twinge out of nervousness.

335,,OCD,"Excerpt: 

Let me give you an example of how you can apply The DARE Response to these intrusive thoughts. Remember, you can’t control intrusive thoughts or worries; you can control only your response to them. Let’s say for example that you’re cutting the vegetables for dinner, and your partner walks into the kitchen and gets something out of the fridge. As they have their back to you, an intrusive thought crosses your mind: “What if I lost control and stabbed him/her in the back with this knife?” 

The old you would have felt a jolt of terror punch you in the stomach and maybe even scare you enough to have to put the knife back in the drawer. The new you, using the philosophy of The DARE Response, doesn’t put the knife down but keeps chopping and begins by defusing the anxious “what if.” “What if I just randomly stabbed him/her with this knife?” “Oh well, then I’d get locked up. At least I wouldn’t have to make dinner anymore!” 

You defuse the anxious thought by being flippant or humorous toward it, instead of being scared by it. Use whatever response you feel achieves that goal. It’s a bit like the way you might respond to a small child who comes into the room dressed as a monster trying to scare you. “Oh, you’re so big and scary!” you say with wry smile. Then allow the intrusive thought to be present without any resistance. Let it stay for as long as it likes. 

Remember the beach ball example. If you try to push it down, it will bounce back, so let it be present and then gently move your attention back to what you were doing. 

On occasion, when you’re feeling quite anxious, some thoughts can have a highly persistent nature. I call it a “high glue factor” as they really stick to you! This is where you can implement the “run toward” step of The DARE Response. Instead of just acknowledging and accepting the thought, you can get excited and demand more of it to really shake yourself loose of its grip. “Oh that’s a weird idea again of doing something totally inappropriate. It seems very strong today. Okay—so let’s have it! I’m going to think about this all day. Come on, let’s see if I can think of even stranger things than that.” 

Lastly, engage with whatever is at hand. In this case, you move your attention back to making the dinner all the while not pushing the thought away. With very intrusive thoughts you may have to do the above steps several times in a row each time the intrusive thoughts grab a hold of you. Once you remove the emotional response to intrusive thoughts, you normalize them and they no longer have an emotional pull. When they no longer have a pull, they fall away by themselves naturally as they have nothing to cling onto.",t2_alf40nbi,False,,0,False,Has anyone read the DARE book?

338,,OCD,"Im 13 i jerked off to a 9 year old to a 10 year old and i think an 11 year old I feel horrible for doing it,

I jerked off the the 10 year old or 11 year old 3 times beacuse my brain told me to i think the 10 year old was when i was 12 idk

I tested myself alot by looking at children and even did it today

I just want to live a normal life

ive spent lots of time looking up pedophilia and pocd and its been haunting me for 2 months Help me

Please ive asked this several times on other accounts you can search latter cockroach or ""pocd or pedo"" on this subreddit by latter cockroach and secretalt1111 
I want to be a normal person i feel guilty
I will never molest children and if I ever feel to do that ill beat myself up and not let myself outside,

Weird thing is I had a crush when I was 12 and she was the same grade so 12 or 11 and it stopped a little after might be beacuse i thought she was my cousin i think shes still cute though shes not my cousin i think

I really want to stop this I cant see a therapist or anything fuck my life man stupid ass shit
One day im thinking that im a pedo next that i have cancer next that i have a tumor next that im gonna die next that i have adhd next that i have dyslexia i cant fucking live normally

My childhood is being ruined by this shit

Fuck my life and fuck this shit
No im not gonna kill myself
I dont support pedophilia i hate all pedophiles i even report pedophiles and type hate shit into their comments fuck pedophilia
I dont want to touch kids, ive never jerked off to that stuff again i even look up the ages of anime/hentai characters i jerk off to Older women 18+ i find the most info i can about their age
Am I a pedophile or is my brain fucking with me
Also heres another part of my other post


Ok the title sounds like some pedophile type shit
Ill explain
Ok first the cousin part I was 12 and a year before my mother told me that a girl was my cousin and when I turned 12 a few months later I was in class and I thought she was hot and I jacked off in class well not jack off i was just rubbing my penis and moving it and I put stuff around me that hides me doing it and i checked if someone was looking and I didnt make myself seem suspicous and I didnt jack off infront of her, nobody noticed beacuse i literally made sure they didnt and when I got home i jacked off to a picture of her and I felt really bad and then a few weeks later when class finished I jacked off when nobody was in the classroom when school ended and we dont have cameras i dont know what i jacked off exactly to but i jacked off and i did it again a few weeks later

Ok the 9/10 year old part
I went to a training thing and my 13 year old brain thought this girl had a nice back and I knew she was in like 4th grade or smth but I still fucking jacked off (I jacked off to a picture when she was 9 i think FUCK ME MAN) (I just turned 13 a few days ago before this happend)
And my dumbass brain then when i finished and went out started calling me a pedophile and then my brain has been calling me a pedophile ever since
And I jacked off to a 10 or 11 year old think she was 10 and I fucking did it 3 times to the to 10 or 11 year old beacuse my brain said ok do it again ok do it again
Also a few months before my brain started telling me look at the back of that girl 9 times and they were all so young like 4th grade or lower and I didnt jack off to them but my brain did that and later it tried to convince me i was a pedophile and shit and i did tests to see if i was a pedophile and i didnt get any treatment i was too scared to tell anyone and i had a lack of treatment in my area and whenever I mentioned pedophiles or made fun of them i told myself 3 times you are not a pedophile

Oh yeah also i fucking got horny or smth and I was behind a pillar thing and I jacked off and then someone like 3-5 meters away passed by with their kids and I felt like a monster i dont know what i jacked off to but it might of been the 10/11 year old but i think i was 12 at this time

From those days I felt like I was going to hell and that im a monster
You can say whatever you want fucking murder me

Alright when I was 12 and im 13 now

Ok I jacked off to a 9-10-11 year old and fell like a pedophile

I moved into my own place only because i can get benifit money which i am so fortunate for because i was living with my dad my parents seperated when i was young my mother died when i was 18 im now 24 they hated eachother and would say things to me about eachother i was always stucks on who is lying since i was a child. Anyway my dad does not understand mental health at all he didn't care to research by ocd he forced me into therapy or would kick me out at 17 even though i never got therapy just 5 years of tests to be told i'm to complex for the therapy they provide... If i stayed at my dads i belive i would have killed myself. He would laugh at me when i cried and ignored me when i cried for him to care he would point at me ridicule me as if he was playing god no body on my dads side understood no matter how much i'd explain i felt exposed and trapped inside a sound proof box like they had no ears. 

Since iv'e moved iv'e realised a lot of my ocd rituals and noticed more i wasnt even aware of and now ive come to it everything i seem to do fits into the box of ocd i lost my friend because i spoke to her about it she said i was so negative she said all these horrible things that im manipulative to get sympathy and i cant stop repeating it around in my head and every other person who misunderstands this disorder i wasn't aware that even sharing things of my ocd was to get reasurence that other people think this way now i realise subcouncously i must have anyway the friend didn't belive anything i said she also did all this on my mother death aniversary and knew it was a hard date this was 2 weeks ago. 

I have nobody to talk to and im alone in my flat im so appreciative i have my flat to learn about my ocd because im not sure i could when i was forced into therapy when i was a teen because i was constantley in flight or fight mode due to my dad being neglectful and my mother dying i was also sexually asulted through my teens and wasnt even aware that it was sexual asult till i was 21 then i got rapped by someone id met online a few times and i cant stop picturing his facial tick gesture and now i realise what the gesture was it was disgust because i pull the same face at my ocd rituals and its like i become him i see his face right infront of me.

My ex friend i mentioned she also said i play the victim when i really don't intend to at all i am just saying what i experienced and i dont mean to come of that way to reddit post either and sorry for all the english errors i'm exhuasted and if i change one thing i will spend hours making everything perfect

342,,OCD,"A month ago I went on a vacation for my birthday and one day on the trip I got extremely drunk. We were talking to a group of men and women in the people and one guy and I were having a conversation and my boyfriend left me in the pool with him and we kept talking. From what I remember I was going on about stories of celebrities we met, stories about my modeling days and I remember him complimenting me as I was probably drunk, getting external validation and just chatting with a random stranger blacked out. For a while Ive dealt with cheating ROCD with my boyfriend and get intrusive thoughts about ""what if this happened..what if I cheated...what if this is cheating..."" and so on; leading to a terrible sense of guilt and unrest.

As you could imagine, this drunken encounter put me over the edge. I texted the man from the pool after the conversation to which he said don't worry he really liked me and it was a great talk and then next time we all coincide he hopes I have more fun stories and celebrity encounters. That should've been enough to put a normal person at ease. My first ocd thought was worried about ""emotionally cheating"" by talking about my modeling stories and vaguely remember showing my youth headshots on my phone (I kind of do to most people when I get drunk, don't ask aha). My boyfriend was like 20 feet away the whole time and let me go off drunk and talk since we both are pretty chill about things and clearly he didn't think this would ever trigger me. It was so inconsequential to every one else but me apparently...but my brain doesn't think that. Once I got the reassurance that nothing bad was said from the pool guy my brain jumped to ""you definitely kissed"". I keep decoding the texts from a month ago with the logic that ""if he said he really liked me and it was a really great talk that means I did something bad and he's just not telling me"", and the sad part is my brain makes that sound so logical. I can't get this thought out of my head and I know if that happened I would've remembered, but my brain is absolutely creating these false memories and mentally reviewing every part of the conversation I can vaguely remember, every hand placement and body movement I can remember from the situation in my head...its not normal. It is exhausting. I saw my erp therapist who told me to accept the thoughts, act like it happened and move on with my life. But this constant guilt feeds at me and I cannot tell if it is my ocd feeding this obsession or if its real guilt. What brought it back up is this guy and I exchanged instagrams apparently and I forget about it until he commented some fire emojis on my recent Instagram selfie which led to another downward spiral of doubting thoughts and guilt, when in reality he probably thinks he just made a drunk friend. I don't know. 

I stopped drinking for about a month now and I feel great. Getting too drunk seemed to be an issue with me but I never thought that one drunken conversation would escalate my ROCD this bad. I try not to bring it up with my boyfriend or ask reassuring questions but my ocd is making me feel like I'm living with some terrible secret and guilt.

Anyway, I recently finally started Sertraline at 50mg and have been taking it for 10 days. It’s taken me months to get to the point of asking for medication and I’m happy. 

My first week I had no real side effects. I had some jaw clenching and excessive yawning but that’s died down now. The past few days though, I’ve been getting sweats/hot flushes followed by the complete opposite in the middle of the night when Im asleep or trying to sleep. I’m justifying these worse than usual side effects as the sertraline ‘beginning to build to a beneficial level’ in my brain.

345,,OCD,"I’ve had harm ocd since I was I think 12. I never told anyone but it’s like the typical thoughts about harming people or I’ll think, “what if I kill someone in my sleep?” I tried to convince myself I had antisocial personality disorder and was faking my feelings.  I’ve ruled that out, it does both me, but not as much as my health ocd. Keep in mind, I don’t convince myself I have any physical health issues like cancer or whatnot, it’s all metal problems. My ocd calmed down for about a year, a few intrusive thoughts here and there. However, I’ve recently been getting thoughts about having mental health issues. Last month, I thought I was autistic and was masking my whole personality. But then, it turned into schizophrenia, which scared me because my uncle had it before he past. My mother told me his schizophrenia was drug induced and that him and a friend he did drugs with both got it after long term drug usage. I’m 17 now, but ever since middle school, I would have thoughts here and there about having schizophrenia. They were never constant or as severe as they are now. I used to think hypnogogic hallucinations before bed that I get here and there were schizophrenia. I also remember being on vacation and I heard voices, so I started freaking out thinking I was developing on site schizophrenia, but when I woke up &amp; asked my mom about it, she said there was a party going on downstairs and she also heard it. Recently however, I’ve been worried about delusions because schizophrenia can cause delusion. I make up delusions in my head and question if they’re real or if I believe them. It started when I started randomly thinking I was schizophrenic, then in a college class, the thought passed my mind, “your thoughts aren’t yours.” At that moment, I could barely focus in class. I started freaking out and questioning why I thought that though. I questioned if I was delusional. After I got home, I told my mother and she assured me it was just my anxiety over having the disorder. So she told me how schizophrenic people think. She said, “ People with schizophrenia actually believe these things. They think aliens are out to get them’’ next thing you know, “mom is an alien, she controls everything.” And I started obsessing over that thought, I questioned if I believed it. Another example is, I started freaking out in the story last Friday over thinking mannequins were out to get me, and I kept thinking, “ I knew it, I’m having delusions. I knew I was schizophrenic” in order to calm myself, I thought in my head, “this is ridiculous, if I really thought they were out to get me, I might as well think all objects can move when people aren’t around and are out to get them.” Next thing you know, I’m thinking about objects being able to move and being out to get me... I know this is irrational, but I question if I believe it and if I’m delusional. Sometimes I’ll even look at an object and I’m about to think of a delusion &amp; stop myself. Also, sometimes I’ll think in my head, “you’re crazy, stop doing this.” And I’ll think “why am I referring to myself as “you”, is that a symptom of psychosis?” The other night, I had a hypnagogic hallucination before bed due to stress. It was right before dozing off to sleep, and I was playing over scenarios in my head of people that I don’t know, one was an old lady. And the thoughts were saying weird stuff, “you’re not crazy, it’s ocd.” And next thing you know, I get scared and get up. My first thought was, “Do I believe people are living in my brain? Why did that happen? Do I have DID?” Idk if that was hypnogogia or if I’m developing a disorder. I also have existential OCD that makes me thing, “Is this real” or “What if I’m dead?” or even “what if I wake up everyday as different person built with memories?” It weird.

Or off meds that treated it 6 months ago 



Slowly the traces of it that remained seem to be getting worse ? 


For example here is my night routine 



1.	Check showers to make sure no ones there, make sure my eyes go to the middle tile where the light strikes a little. 
2.	Make sure I am on the right tiles for step number one while avoiding parts of the tile struck by light. 
3.	check area to the right of sink where shelves are, bottom right top left bottom middle and middle top. 
4.	walk back and fourth from sink tile area to shelves area to make it 3 times that I passed by the mirror 
5.	look in the mirror. This one is tricky. I have to make sure I don’t mind how I look because I think that if I look ugly in the mirror, It will make my ugly. This can lead to me rearranging my hair right before I sleep. 
5.	step on a particular tile in the bathroom, then on a particular tile to exit. Turn off light, make sure that I am showing on the right panel of the mirror, if for instance it’s folded in I go back in bathroom close it mostly and do step 4 2 more times to make it 3 
6.	close door while making sure i see myself on all 3 panels of the mirror but specifically the one all the way to the left 
7.	turn off light if didn’t do already before step 6 
8.	pull on door slightly to get it as ajar as possible before closing it 
9.	close SLOWLY while making eye contact with the area above the toilet without blinking to make sure no one / nothing is there. I can’t look at the toilet out of fear it’ll make me ugly/ something bad will happen. 
10. Once closed I move on to kitchen and living room where I have other routines tho not as complex

373,,OCD,"
So I’ve been having issues with harm OCD. I’m afraid I’ll harm myself, babies, and people who have wronged me. Naturally I would never kill anything. I couldn’t even kill an animal. But I’m worried and here’s why

When I was a kid I remember taking little big catchers and catching Crain flies and shaking them until they died. That makes me cringe even saying that. And when my dad saw I told him “well there’s more out there anyway” like it didn’t matter I killed it. I also would step on a ton of ants. I would never even do this now but even like last year when flies get into the house i kind of enjoy trying to swat them with a towel and trying to hit them. I heard psychopaths start on small animals. Does this count?!?!? I would never ever even harm a Crain fly for no reason now, let alone something like a rat or dog

Now here’s why I think it’s just OCD. My dad always says I have a huge heart. If I was a psychopath would my parents be able to tell since an early age i didn’t have a huge heart? And like 2 weeks ago I almost cried arguing with my mom lol. And I also woke up in panic after dozing off a lot of times because I remember one day my old dog is going to die.

My reasoning is that they would know I own the computer, so even if I move into my own apartment, them merely knowing about the computer and it being on their minds would feel kind of intrusive, it's as if they would be in my new apartment with me which leaves me feeling like I have no privacy at all.

390,,OCD,"Hello,

I have magical thinking and harm OCD and I recently started to feel guilty because I didn't see a therapist until I became very sick. During 10 years, I had OCD thoughts, some involving harming people around me. I feel so bad that I stayed in the OCD cycle even if I knew something was wrong with me. It's like I didn't care about the people around me that were part of my thoughts. I feared I could be dangerous and knew my thoughts were bad, but I didn't do nothing about it until it became too hard to live with this. When taking important decisions, I often had to chose between two ""consequences""; for exemple, if I chose the option A, I had to harm a family member and if I chose the option B, had to harm a friend. I never listened to these consequences, but they created a lot of distress, guilt and anxiety. Now,  I can't believe it took so much time for me to seek help. I know that, younger, I didn't know what I had, but when I started to realize it was OCD, why didn't I consult right away? It makes me feel guilty.

401,,OCD,"For the last week or two, especially when I’m working, I have intrusive/unwanted recollections of dreams I’ve had over the years. The dreams were significant, and not all of them make sense. It doesn’t really stop me from what I’m doing or cause any thing else to happen and it’s only for a second or few seconds. I’m not seeing anything I’m just thinking of the dream or remembering it. I have this sensation like 10+ times a day it seems. It’s not really deja vu because it’s not like I look at something and am reminded of it. And there is not really any trigger to it. And I’m not thinking about dreams when it happens.

I don’t really have trouble falling asleep either but I’ll occasionally twitch when falling asleep. Like a jolt. 

I don’t take melatonin and haven’t anytime recently. But I do dream frequently and always have cause I have an overactive mind (ADHD/OCD)

409,,OCD,"Trigger warning, sexual abuse, no details though.

I do not have a diagnosis. But, I don't think it matters that much because of my history with mental health and getting diagnoses. I've had anxiety my whole life, and depression starting at 11, but I just didn't have the resources/ability to get a depression diagnosis until I was 19. It took another year (and being a patient in a mental health PHP) to realize that my baseline thought process was very skewed, and that anxiety is pretty much built into my personality.

I had a really difficult time coming to terms with even asking if I had these diseases because I was scared that I actually didn't, and it would come across as if I had so little mental fortitude that I believed my superficial sadness or worries were actually mental illness. I kind of feel the same way now because, at this point in my life, I don't know if my intrusive thoughts cause as much distress and avoidance as they would need to to be considered symptoms of a diagnosable disorder.

I know that I should speak to a psychiatrist about this, but I'm thinking about telling her the fucked up thoughts I have verbally, and I just think it would be easier to air them out here, anonymously and through writing, first. I'm kind of just going to monologue here, and I'd appreciate any comments this community has to say.

From the ages of 8-11, every time I would be on an unprotected subway platform, I would be overwhelmed by both an urge to jump and by an extreme fear of doing so. I would turn my back to the platform and grip something so that there was an extra step between me jumping (letting go of whatever I was holding on to). This urge/fear was completely alleviated by protected platforms (some stations had these automated 6 ft tall fences between you and the tracks). This feeling also happened whenever I was around something high I could jump off of.

I think things get a little muddied when my depression came into because I feel like my suicidal thoughts were ""real"". They weren't distressing, it was actually very comforting that I had an option for a way out. Years go by, and just because my brain is fucked up, I had such a disconnect that I 100% felt like my suicidal thoughts were just thoughts and that I wasn't suicidal at all.

So, freshman year of college comes around (last year), and I have this realization/mental breakdown, where I realize I actually do not plan to live out the rest of my life, my thoughts are real and that will my future if I do not intervene. That's when I started treatment for depression. I stopped smoking weed, and whenever I'd try again, I would just be plagued by thoughts of suicide. I don't even know if they were real now. They felt real. It also felt intrusive.  I don't know.

Last summer, I started smoking again. Things went well for a few months, and then I had another breakdown, and the thoughts I had keep coming back to haunt me. I am very afraid of them. I am afraid of having those thoughts enter my mind, the imagined feelings, and imagery. I feel the need to introduce some context before I say these thoughts.

For a while before that breakdown (like 2 years of time), I was somewhat suspicious that I had been sexually abused as a child. And, that's just not something you're allowed to be wrong about if you verbalize it. At this point now, I have worked out that that most likely did not happen, but there was a good amount of evidence suggesting that it was true (although none of those points would definitively say it happened). I don't think getting into the details is important, but my long-term boyfriend told me he also suspected that was true based on some things I've said and some behavior I've shown in the past. My point is, I didn't just make something up out of the blue.

In those two years' time, I would go through phases of tirelessly searching the internet, trying to science my way into figuring out if that happened to be or not. I never really found anything one way or another.

So, that second mental breakdown had to do with me ""realizing"" I had probably been sexually abused as a child. The thought process isn't important, but is is that immediately after, I was terrified that I would remember something, that I just would have this thing in my head that I, unwillingly, could be forced to relive over and over because I know my own mind would do something like that to me.

Even after I worked out that it most likely is not, I still am so scared of being in a mental space where I end up imagining it happen. So, I had to stop smoking of course. But, also, over the past 6 months or so, I have been struggling with panic attacks, primarily the dissociation aspect (which happened during both of my breakdowns), and each time I am terrified that my mind will produce something unspeakable for me to experience while I'm in that state.

I've written a lot here, thank you for listening. Do you guys think I have pure O? I feel like I could have had other obsessions but just not know it because of all the other things I just didn't know were mental illness thoughts. I really miss smoking, but I am so scared of the power my thoughts could have over me. In my pretty limited research into this subject, I've read that an effective treatment is to confront your thoughts instead of do things to avoid them, which makes them stronger. Do you think I should just smoke and actively try to think about these things to show it won't actually hurt me? I know this sounds absolutely ridiculous, but I just enjoyed smoking so much, I have great memories smoking with my friends, and it makes me unhappy to think it will never be in my cards again. I've done acid a couple of times, and I really enjoyed it too. I felt like it was something I'd like to do again (like 1 or 2 times a year), but it seems like that option is closed off too.

Edit: I just started college again this semester after literally putting everything on pause to treat my depression and anxiety. I just want to live normally. I want to have fun like people my age do, because I haven't been able to that much. I feel like my life has just been a series of disruptions to a person's normal development. ",t2_5ek0mps,False,,0,False,I think I might have pure O. I don't know where i should go from here.

&lt;p&gt;I do not have a diagnosis. But, I don&amp;#39;t think it matters that much because of my history with mental health and getting diagnoses. I&amp;#39;ve had anxiety my whole life, and depression starting at 11, but I just didn&amp;#39;t have the resources/ability to get a depression diagnosis until I was 19. It took another year (and being a patient in a mental health PHP) to realize that my baseline thought process was very skewed, and that anxiety is pretty much built into my personality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had a really difficult time coming to terms with even asking if I had these diseases because I was scared that I actually didn&amp;#39;t, and it would come across as if I had so little mental fortitude that I believed my superficial sadness or worries were actually mental illness. I kind of feel the same way now because, at this point in my life, I don&amp;#39;t know if my intrusive thoughts cause as much distress and avoidance as they would need to to be considered symptoms of a diagnosable disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that I should speak to a psychiatrist about this, but I&amp;#39;m thinking about telling her the fucked up thoughts I have verbally, and I just think it would be easier to air them out here, anonymously and through writing, first. I&amp;#39;m kind of just going to monologue here, and I&amp;#39;d appreciate any comments this community has to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the ages of 8-11, every time I would be on an unprotected subway platform, I would be overwhelmed by both an urge to jump and by an extreme fear of doing so. I would turn my back to the platform and grip something so that there was an extra step between me jumping (letting go of whatever I was holding on to). This urge/fear was completely alleviated by protected platforms (some stations had these automated 6 ft tall fences between you and the tracks). This feeling also happened whenever I was around something high I could jump off of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think things get a little muddied when my depression came into because I feel like my suicidal thoughts were &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;. They weren&amp;#39;t distressing, it was actually very comforting that I had an option for a way out. Years go by, and just because my brain is fucked up, I had such a disconnect that I 100% felt like my suicidal thoughts were just thoughts and that I wasn&amp;#39;t suicidal at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, freshman year of college comes around (last year), and I have this realization/mental breakdown, where I realize I actually do not plan to live out the rest of my life, my thoughts are real and that will my future if I do not intervene. That&amp;#39;s when I started treatment for depression. I stopped smoking weed, and whenever I&amp;#39;d try again, I would just be plagued by thoughts of suicide. I don&amp;#39;t even know if they were real now. They felt real. It also felt intrusive.  I don&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last summer, I started smoking again. Things went well for a few months, and then I had another breakdown, and the thoughts I had keep coming back to haunt me. I am very afraid of them. I am afraid of having those thoughts enter my mind, the imagined feelings, and imagery. I feel the need to introduce some context before I say these thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a while before that breakdown (like 2 years of time), I was somewhat suspicious that I had been sexually abused as a child. And, that&amp;#39;s just not something you&amp;#39;re allowed to be wrong about if you verbalize it. At this point now, I have worked out that that most likely did not happen, but there was a good amount of evidence suggesting that it was true (although none of those points would definitively say it happened). I don&amp;#39;t think getting into the details is important, but my long-term boyfriend told me he also suspected that was true based on some things I&amp;#39;ve said and some behavior I&amp;#39;ve shown in the past. My point is, I didn&amp;#39;t just make something up out of the blue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In those two years&amp;#39; time, I would go through phases of tirelessly searching the internet, trying to science my way into figuring out if that happened to be or not. I never really found anything one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that second mental breakdown had to do with me &amp;quot;realizing&amp;quot; I had probably been sexually abused as a child. The thought process isn&amp;#39;t important, but is is that immediately after, I was terrified that I would remember something, that I just would have this thing in my head that I, unwillingly, could be forced to relive over and over because I know my own mind would do something like that to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after I worked out that it most likely is not, I still am so scared of being in a mental space where I end up imagining it happen. So, I had to stop smoking of course.

416,,OCD,"Hi all, I struggle with sexually-based intrusive thoughts and due to this struggle with groinal responses. When they first started it was very troubling and confusing, but I’ve more or less gotten used to them now. The thing is at a certain point liquid started coming out of my penis when the groinal responses would happen. I am unsure if this liquid is urine or pre-ejaculate, but I really need it to stop. 

I believe that I may be developing contamination OCD as well. This combined with the liquids from groinal responses is very troubling. Whenever I go to the bathroom I fear that I will have left some of these liquids behind and if I don’t try to clean them up with soap and water I feel as if I’m committing a sex crime. I wash my hands way too much as well, to the point where my knuckles have become dry, red, and raw. 

I don’t masturbate anymore really because I’m afraid about getting cum on things, so I only really do it in the shower now. Due to the infrequent masturbation I have been having frequent wet dreams, which of course I feel as if I have to clean everything after. 

I think I may have developed a physical condition because my testicles and taint feel tight and uncomfortable occasionally. There must be something physically wrong right? Otherwise these liquids wouldn’t come out of my penis. 

Anyways I know this was all a lot, but my two questions regarding all of this are: 

1) Does anyone know what may be physically wrong with me?

2) How do I stop contamination obsessions?

I'm very curious if anyone of you guys ever had a fucked up experience on Weed similar to mine. I'd love to know your stories. Apparently can come from Derealization/depersonalization, general anxiety, OCD and ADHD. Just know that you aren't alone and I understand how horrible it is.  


&amp;#x200B;

I felt trapped, and extremely panicked, I wanted to escape from reality. I was seeing demonic hexagonal shapes, my vision was divided in these fucked up diamond shaped patterns that all represented the shit I was fearing. It felt as if the real world was made out of this hellraiser metallic material. I'd see borders from my vision and out side the borders were purple and pink visual hazes and they would contain picture example of any metaphorical thoughts I'd have.  I'd get a barrage of these existential thoughts and would try to solve one of these horrible thoughts to get a grasp on my sanity only for the evil voice inside my head to completely disprove my solution and add an even harder obstacle for me to solve while millions of other horrible thoughts added up and multiplied into groups and then group from those groups. I remember seeing a visualization of the level of mental understanding my brain was on and the number honestly was something like ""Uzihexalterafaux"" and it represented a shit pantsingly high number. and I'd go into another cycle of whatever the hell I was going through much more intense than the last. My brain mapped out the type of hell I was in and it was Daemonic Black x8 out of x10. Crazy shit.  


I'd have these waves/pulses that would hit me like waves of sudden realization that would add more and more ""realizations"" in my brain. I was convinced that I was either in hell or that I was facing a punishment that no mortal could even experience but that of a god. And I was cursed with immortality to endure it.   


At times I'd start to lose consciousness and see this blue type of tunnel, it turns out I was on auto pilot, I'd be in the house during the auto pilot and regain awareness outside my home with my loved one freaking out telling me that ""I'm going crazy."" The my loved one said that to me honestly gave me an overwhelming since of tragedy. Everything felt like a movie, that all of life only existed from my perspective and that it all led up to my experience, like some fucked up final trial to discover the ultimate truth. Constant Deja Vu, everything had a very overwhelming sense of familiarity but at the same time perceived it all as alien and weird. A huge constant paradox that my brain had to balance otherwise I'd be consumed by it all.  


Near the end things got better and my constant thoughts that would just give me horrible conclusions finally turned I'd now be challenged with questions that I'd answer with bad solutions only for now a good voice inside my head to give me good solutions to the questions of reality that would make sooth my panic and it would keep repeating there, each with better answers of my constant questions of reality that would plague me. At this point my high was now telling me that my questions and worries I'd have out existence was being solved and that what I experienced was just a trial for me be cured and that the ultimate understanding was actually good and all my worries and anxiety was for nothing. Afterwards I felt confused and decided to sleep. Even though the high ended on a good note the prior experience was deeply traumatizing for me and I was afraid I'd never be normal. After a few weeks I felt empty and a bit depressed. But I noticed my existential OCD was nearly gone.   


So in the end I honestly believe what happened was some fucked up exposure therapy that resulted in my existential OCD anxiety to pretty much go away. But good god the shit I went through was honestly fucked up. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy and would honestly prefer a bullet to the leg then to experience that shit again.  


I'm glad that something good came out of this experience, it cured my existential OCD and it honestly made me much more stronger mentally.

I'm a 28F with OCD that dates back as far as I can remember. My OCD mainly manifests itself into responsibility and moral perfection. It is, frankly and excuse my language, fucking exhausting. Before the pandemic, I felt like I had made so much progress and then being in endless lockdowns and away from the routines that brought some perspective and routine into my life, I feel like I am in the most vulnerable place I have been in a long time. I know I will be okay, but I am not okay right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Despite this struggle, something that has really helped recently is joining OCD support groups. I am doing this over zoom and it is essentially an open meeting where you can share (or just listen) to others people's experiences with OCD. This is the first time in my life I have talked with people who have OCD and it has made me feel so much less alone. OCD manifests in so many different ways and it's easy to feel like no one might understand or relate to your struggle but trust that there are other people out there who completely understand what you are going through from their own experience.

When all of these feeling flair up I'm ashamed to say it but I instantly fall into bad depressions and feel suicidal despite trying to think of pretty much anything else (hormones throughout the month don't help either..).

441,,OCD,I added support for flair because i want that but also have a question. My mom used to touch me inappropriately as a joke or “accidentally” and i hated it and it made me super uncomfortable but for the past year my brain has been acting very differently about it. When my mom accidentally touches my butt or some other area i just dont do anything for two seconds and let it happen because in the moment i think i like it or want it to happen and it happened a few minutes ago. I felt kind of turned on thinking this is hot even though i do not view my mom sexually and would never do anything w her bc that is absolutely disgusting. Anyway after those two seconds i moved away and sort of jumped back. But it feels like i had acted on something and i immediately started feeling gross and like i did something with my mom. Incest completely disgusts me and i get a lot of ocd thoughts about unwanted sexual thoughts w her and i get disgusted so why do i like it when these things happen???? I also have a bf and i feel like i cheated on him in the most foul way even if nothing much happened. I dont know if I should tell him so he can get out of a relationship with someone as sickening as me. It sort of felt like i froze up bc i liked it or something but then i decided to move.

442,,OCD,"Throwaway account. I've not been diagnosed with OCD, I'm here because some of my loved ones have suggested I do some research.

I've been looking into OCD and there's a lot of stuff I identify with but there's even more I don't. I've been battling anxiety (and winning) for the last 13 years of my life. Went to therapy for GAD years ago but got frustrating by the format and stopped going. I've abused weed and booze since I was 15 because I feel like I can't get any peace without something that alters my mind. Whilst it has been terrible in the past I am now in a place where it's manageable.

I spend all my time trying to improve who I am as a person and I think I've done an incredible job. The scared, anxious little boy I used to be would be excited to see who I am today... but I still get intense feelings of failure. Logically know I am a decent person but no matter how much I try to rationalise that with myself I get into these dark loops of self hate that convinces me I'm a degenerate.

My work flow is sporadic. 14 hour work days followed by 2 hour work days. When I finish a long day of work I've never achieved enough. The anxiety makes it impossible to work sometimes; I'll be sitting at my desk with all my programs up but make zero progress because I'm thinking about not making progress.

Researching OCD is confusing... it's so broad. I don't fit the stereotype at all. I'm afraid of getting tested because I've dealt with my pain all alone. I feel weak sharing it and weaker accepting help; this post alone feels deeply wrong to me. I need to be

450,,OCD,"Hi all:) I hope you're doing okay on your way to recovery. 

My OCD symptoms have decreased a bit I would say. I still have occasional bad days, but not as bad as the weeks prior. 

However, something I still struggle with is having a good sleep rhythm as well as motivation to do things. 

Basically, I can't fall asleep before 2 am, sometimes even 3 or 4 am. I sleep at least 10 hours, sometimes up to 12. My whole day is just gone then. I hate it and yeah, I kinda criticize myself a lot when it comes to this. I have tried a special alarm clock but it doesn't work. However, if I need to get up for an appointment, I will do it. But that's more the exception, I'm lacking structure.

Now, I have already tried to create a structure. I have plenty of things I would love to do. But then I don't. It's like something is keeping me from doing it. Like something's holding me back. This means I don't do things I would enjoy and that would help me feel better - sports, eating better food, reading.

I have no idea how to get out of this. I'm so ashamed because to me it feels like I'm not trying enough.

I think it is killing me slowly. I don't know if my health problems are caused by this or if it is because I didn't move much in over a year because of ptsd. Propably a combination of both.

Tidy up my room full of things. I really didn't move for one year. Not even inside of my room. Meet the nice part of my family again and start doing things I like again. 

Also only take one pill a day. 
I don't know how to deal with this because going down from 5 a day to 1 a day will make me vulnerable. At least for one month. Problem is that when I do this and I tried very often, I am not afraid that I could get a child, I think that I will have a child. My mind is so far from reality. 
I feel like I could only pray and wait and that will be a horrible time for me. 

I don't have anyone to support me. Most people don't understand my fear and don't support me. I have yet to open up to my therapist about this.

&lt;p&gt;I am running out of tablets again and propably have to lie to my doctor about where they went. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am 17, single and horrified of everything sexually related. That is caused by the trauma. I want to get my life together until my 18th birthday.&lt;br/&gt;
Tidy up my room full of things. I really didn&amp;#39;t move for one year. Not even inside of my room. Meet the nice part of my family again and start doing things I like again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also only take one pill a day. 
I don&amp;#39;t know how to deal with this because going down from 5 a day to 1 a day will make me vulnerable. At least for one month. Problem is that when I do this and I tried very often, I am not afraid that I could get a child, I think that I will have a child. My mind is so far from reality. 
I feel like I could only pray and wait and that will be a horrible time for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have anyone to support me. Most people don&amp;#39;t understand my fear and don&amp;#39;t support me. I have yet to open up to my therapist about this. Anyone has any tips how to get through the waiting time until you find out that you truly are not pregnant? Will be around one month of just taking one pill. I don&amp;#39;t know if I can manage the constant panic and the pain for this long.&lt;/p&gt;

458,,OCD,"Just joined this subreddit today, and honestly reading about the posts in this community have made me feel less lonely. So I just wanted to tell you guys about my journey.

Many post I’ve seen about OCD, more specifically PureO, often mention a “guilt” and for me, it certainly stemmed from my cocaine addiction I used to struggle with a couple years ago. Fortunately, I was able to stop, but the recovery process (Approx. span of 1 year) involved a lot of ruminations where I would have no drive or energy to do anything, rather just sit/lay in bed and constantly say the same reassurance over and over and over again until it just... felt right? After recovering for about a year, these thoughts have seemed to stop, and for a second, I was super proud of myself. No more laying in bed for 2-3 hours at a time thinking the same thoughts over and over. My nose/septum was pretty messed up due to my past usage and coke’s known to form a hole in your nose in chronic users due to the deterioration. But fortunately I don’t have a hole in my septum, but I do have a skinny septum now. 

It wasn’t until recently that I’ve randomly started having these thoughts again. A constant worry about a hole forming in my nose. I don’t do that stuff anymore, but if I do, I’ll just gum a little here and there, but never snorting through my nose. Although I know I didn’t do enough of it in the past to form a hole in my septum, I constantly seek self-reassurance through long lasting ruminations which involve squeezing my nose together to reassure myself that my septum is fine. Usually, I’d reassure myself once and that would be fine for me. But recently, I’ve been having this deadly urge to do it over and over until it just feels right, but it’s been getting so much harder to reach that “sweet spot” to ease my anxiety. I feel like my septum is getting skinnier and skinnier which causes me to do it over and over again. I know that I have no reason to worry about it, but I still do. And this is what’s driving me crazier every single day. I used to ruminate for multiple hours multiple times a day, but I’ve been able to reduce it from multiple hours to multiple minutes. Even though I’ve been able to reduce it down, I’ve noticed that I’m starting to develop an urge to do it more frequently. I don’t know how to stop these urges. I’ve read everything, but I just can’t seem to prevent these thoughts from coming into my head. It’s getting so much more tiring, I can’t even study anymore, dread going to work, and would rather just lay in my bed doing absolutely nothing besides watching Youtube videos or scrolling through social media because it gets my mind off of it. I go to sleep with these thoughts and instantly wake up with them every single day.

461,,OCD,"I have never owned a bathroom scale. When I was in high school a decade ago, I developed an exercise obsession. I’d go to the gym for at least an hour every single day. After my long workout, I’d always go into the locker room and get on the scale. This, of course, turned into an unhealthy obsession with my weight. I was never really underweight and my mom praised me for taking such an interest in my “health”, but it messed with me mentally for a long time and I realized that I needed to stop because I was bordering on eating disorder territory. I went to the gym less and made a very conscious effort to avoid the scale. This is before I was officially diagnosed.

Recently, I went to the doctor and found out I have slightly high cholesterol. My weight was also not where I was hoping it would be. Not overweight, but not a number I would be comfortable disclosing to loved ones. My SO and I are making an effort to be healthier these days because we want to live long happy lives and also look great for our wedding next year. I was working out three times a week, but with the recent discoveries at the doctors office I decided to increase that to five days a week. We don’t leave the house much these days for obvious reasons and I want to do what I can to be healthy, so I thought I’d set a goal wedding weight. My doctor approved of the goal weight, but now I’ve reached a conundrum...

Do I buy a bathroom scale?

Pros: it would help me keep an eye on my weight to make sure I don’t keep gaining it, it would encourage me to keep exercising if I see some results (even very mild results), it would give me something concrete to hold myself to when it comes to health goals

Cons: the obsessions I had in high school could come back in full swing

After my long workout, I’d always go into the locker room and get on the scale. This, of course, turned into an unhealthy obsession with my weight. I was never really underweight and my mom praised me for taking such an interest in my “health”, but it messed with me mentally for a long time and I realized that I needed to stop because I was bordering on eating disorder territory. I went to the gym less and made a very conscious effort to avoid the scale. This is before I was officially diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I went to the doctor and found out I have slightly high cholesterol. My weight was also not where I was hoping it would be. Not overweight, but not a number I would be comfortable disclosing to loved ones. My SO and I are making an effort to be healthier these days because we want to live long happy lives and also look great for our wedding next year. I was working out three times a week, but with the recent discoveries at the doctors office I decided to increase that to five days a week. We don’t leave the house much these days for obvious reasons and I want to do what I can to be healthy, so I thought I’d set a goal wedding weight. My doctor approved of the goal weight, but now I’ve reached a conundrum...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do I buy a bathroom scale?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros: it would help me keep an eye on my weight to make sure I don’t keep gaining it, it would encourage me to keep exercising if I see some results (even very mild results), it would give me something concrete to hold myself to when it comes to health goals&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons: the obsessions I had in high school could come back in full swing&lt;/p&gt;

467,,OCD,"TW: Pedophilia, cancel culture, abuse, sex, incest, rape  


Before beginning the post I want to clarify that I'm under treatment right now, so a lot of the things I now know thanks to the team of professionals that were and are working with me right now (And that i've been lucky to find my old therapist, who helped me through that stage of my life a long time ago):  


I always had sexual related OCD (Aside from many other things within my OCD, but they doesn't come to the case of what I want to vent today), in which I would fear that I actually liked my mother and intrusive thoughts about her or figures like Virgin Mary (not a Christian any longer but was raised pretty Christian so that stuff stuck with me) naked or being raped and I asked to myself: Do I like this? What if this is exciting me?

And that is something I worked a lot on therapy back in the day, but I dropped out of therapy sometime around 2014, and I was pretty much on my own since back then. The times I wanted to take again, I had all bad experiences and never found my old therapist contact to be with her.   
So this stuff ranged from being pretty obsessed and stressed about it for months, to calm me down and have the blessing to talk with people around me who understood my situation.

So, fast-forwarding and omitting the stuff in the middle (Else this is going to be even longer):

It was the mid-2020s, and quarantine here (Argentina) was pretty severe and long (In theory, we still are in quarantine). I was under heavy depression and anxiety, and all of a sudden I started to read a lot of people on Twitter being outed for being child groomers, pedophiles, and stuff. That's when it has begun. I knew I did stuff that was cancellable back in my late teens and I was digging thru my memory, and I recalled some of those things. I started to feel unforgivable, that I have committed the ultimate sin, that anytime soon I was going to be called out and canceled. But what was worst is that it started revolving around the idea of me being a Pedophile or a Groomer.  I remembered that I was an asshole with people and that I experienced some sort of backlash in a Facebook group I used to be. And in this memory, I was between 18 and 20, and I was flirting with a 14-year-old child on Facebook. I kind of started to believe that more and more, didn't have where to look for actual proof or who to ask about it. So I was asking everyone around me if I was a pedophile, that I have done this, that I believed that happened. The answers ranged from my uncle saying that he didn't remember that (I used to speak to him about my problems where I wasn't on therapy and I wouldn't have hidden this from him) and the rest of my family saying it wasn't a big deal, that I should let go of it.

So I started to speak to friends from here, which said that sucks but it's all right if I can understand that was wrong. But I was convinced I was a pedo and that I deserved punishment, torture, and death.   
I ended up talking with someone who was my friend on Twitter (We share the same interest and pursue visual arts) after they talked to me about the pedophile behavior of someone being outed and I started 'confessing' in a parade of telling them that I was feeling guilty and anxious about it, that I supposed that I'm better than this people... and then asking constantly ""Am I better than this people? Was I a pedo? Are we still friends?"" of course it didn't end well after pushing them around for a couple of times. But I had what I was looking for, reassurance and punishment: they told me everything I wanted to hear, from the part that I was a child predator and have no way to be better, to tell me that I was acting like I was acting because ""I was caught"". 

I believed them, thanked them, and move out from Twitter for... like a month apparently, I ended creating another account because I wanted to keep looking at these call-outs and punish myself.  
And I couldn't do anything, I couldn't study, I couldn't draw, if I drew I did just one line and perhaps finish it days later if I shared art on a server or with someone it was after a long time.   
I remember that back in this time my sister got tested for Covid-19 twice and I was pretty stressed over it too.

I finally decided to get help and met a therapist online, we were doing great and she made me see all these stuff were related to OCD, we worked a couple of months and it helped a lot, but ended leaving in some sort of breakdown (plus she has some views of the world I didn't agreed with a lot and made me a little iffy) 

From there I've spent time going to one, and another, until like some miracle, my old therapist contact appeared on the internet. And I tried sending her an email... and she answered!  
From then I have my sessions with her and updated her on my status. What happened next is that I talked to her about these events, and she told me what happened (She still has my clinical notes, which I didn't expect)   
So I wasn't 20, it was in 2011, it was between my 16-17, I was a dropout of hs and I was all day every day in my home because I was afraid to get out because I was robbed and they tried to kidnap me on a trip (This is why I started treatment originally). So I entered a bunch of Facebook groups of fandoms that I wasn't really that interested but I wanted people to be friends with. And somehow people hated me for, I guess that I was pretty much an annoying edgy, weird, stupid dude. So one day I kind of blow up and sent all of them to screw with the most hurtful stuff I could say to people who had actually suffered heavy stuff. With also being kind of creepy with the girls of the group saying to everybody that I liked them because I knew they were already mad with me. And that years later I apologized to most of them and my apologies was received positively.   


Now I don't know in which part of my mind has fitted the story of me and a 14-year-old. I never dated anyone more than two age younger than me, and even if I had some creepy behavior in my 19s it wasn't grooming minors.

I still battle with two thoughts: one is the fear of cancel culture, that if I get successful in what I like this person might come and say ""No, don't trust this person is a pedo he told me this"" and how do I explain myself? Who is going to believe me when I say that my mind fucked me up? I will forever be shunned and even if people understand, what I did is still unforgivable and people will shun me anyway. I imagine the discourse over and over again, imagine my defense, her statement, mine, people taking opinions on it, people bullying me. I live this situation in my head nearly every second of my life.

And the second is the fear that I actually I'm lying to myself, to all my therapists, and that I'm actually a pedophile and sexual predator that is manipulating her and everyone around me to believe me and not being held accountable for my tremendously heinous crimes. If not, why would have been obsessed with this? Why would I put something that wasn't real as real in the first place?

And something that helps me to feed the second thought is that I actually ended sympathizing with someone who I thought was unfairly canceled because people didn't let him grow up from his mistakes... but then I learned his ""mistakes"" were a year ago... and watching the victim's video I learned that he was actually manipulating everything and was an actual groomer, and I felt stupid to sending him my support thinking that it was all hysterical cancel culture. And again, if I defended a pedophile, then I should be one, and I'm manipulating everyon-AAAAAH I CAN'T TAKE THIS SHIT ANYMORE! It doesn't matter if I have logic, and facts (what my therapist told me about the incident) I still having this thoughts and is stressful as fuck...

Thanks to anyone who read up on here, I know it is a long post, but even with therapy, I feel lonely and that I don't have many people to talk about my OCD and what's causing me. Most people around me got sick of me asking every time for reassurance. And still, I fear that what I really did is even cancellable and I must be thrown into a hole forever.

I imagine the discourse over and over again, imagine my defense, her statement, mine, people taking opinions on it, people bullying me. I live this situation in my head nearly every second of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the second is the fear that I actually I&amp;#39;m lying to myself, to all my therapists, and that I&amp;#39;m actually a pedophile and sexual predator that is manipulating her and everyone around me to believe me and not being held accountable for my tremendously heinous crimes. If not, why would have been obsessed with this? Why would I put something that wasn&amp;#39;t real as real in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And something that helps me to feed the second thought is that I actually ended sympathizing with someone who I thought was unfairly canceled because people didn&amp;#39;t let him grow up from his mistakes... but then I learned his &amp;quot;mistakes&amp;quot; were a year ago... and watching the victim&amp;#39;s video I learned that he was actually manipulating everything and was an actual groomer, and I felt stupid to sending him my support thinking that it was all hysterical cancel culture. And again, if I defended a pedophile, then I should be one, and I&amp;#39;m manipulating everyon-AAAAAH I CAN&amp;#39;T TAKE THIS SHIT ANYMORE! It doesn&amp;#39;t matter if I have logic, and facts (what my therapist told me about the incident) I still having this thoughts and is stressful as fuck...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to anyone who read up on here, I know it is a long post, but even with therapy, I feel lonely and that I don&amp;#39;t have many people to talk about my OCD and what&amp;#39;s causing me. Most people around me got sick of me asking every time for reassurance. And still, I fear that what I really did is even cancellable and I must be thrown into a hole forever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This space though makes me feel a lot better, and that I&amp;#39;m not alone. I see a lot of posts of people struggling with the same or almost the same issues, and I feel companion. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

473,,OCD,"Hi, I know this isn’t really a typical post here but I do believe I have ROCD and most people on this sub are much more understanding and nonjudgmental than relationship subs.
So I’ve been with my bf for over a year and a half although we did for a few weeks over 2 years ago now but I didn’t fancy him enough so I broke it up but stupidly kissed someone a few hours before I ended it - feel absolutely horrible and guilty enough for this please don’t hate on me.
Anyway, we got back together 6 months later, I confessed and he forgive me. I started to get suspicions about his female friend and if they had any history so I asked him. Initially he lied about it and said nothing ever happened between them but then he fessed up 10 mins later and told me they had had sex more than once in the past. Obviously was before we were together so I wasn’t mad I was just upset he lied to me and tried to hide it. Anyway that was almost a year ago and I let it slide, moved on but I let him know at that time that his friendship with her made me slightly uncomfortable. Anyway, summer came along and I noticed he was super weird with his phone. He would open all his other friends Snapchat’s bar hers if I was next to him, I ignored it for a few weeks but then brought it up and he said he didn’t even realise blah blah. Then the next time he opened her message in front me she happened to call him “boo” which I guess can be friendly but also not comfortable with someone calling my boyfriend of a year, boo. Once again, ignored it. 
Then last night I got the urge to go on his phone. Which I do not condone and I think it is such a stupid thing to do! But if I hadn’t, I wouldn’t have found him telling her his new address on the 2nd day I had moved back into my uni accommodation an hour away from him in September last year. I was on his phone for approx 30 seconds and as soon as I seen that realised I was being a stupid idiot and left it. But now I’ve seen this and I’m worried.
I don’t tbink he’d cheat, or anything like that. But the fact of the matter is, he knows I am not the most comfortable with their friendship but he still decided to invite her round to his flat alone and didn’t tell me because he obviously knows that I wouldn’t think it was okay.
I believe if there’s something you’re doing that you don’t want to tell your SO about it then you shouldn’t be doing it. 
I had absolutely no idea this happened, I didn’t think they had seen each other since summer last year and I’m a little upset. Although my anxiety is telling me that I’m the worst person ever for the way I found this out and that it’s all my fault and he deserves someone better anyway and I have no right to be upset because of what I did 2 years ago. I have a bad compulsion of confession stupid irrelevant stuff but my mind is telling me I need to tell him this or I’m a horrible person. I also have a bad compulsion of looking up what other people think online and everyone seems to think snooping is horrible which I agree with it but I only was on his phone for literally 2 seconds. Ugh I don’t know I feel so shit

I had bad depression during pregnancy and after the birth. I am still on the highest dose of Lexipro. Lately its not cutting it. I feel imprisoned in my own mind. 

I want to be clear that I love my child with every fiber of my being. I have a good life and am fully functional. I work full time and have been trying to get into dental hygiene. I am a top employee at my work and come off as an extrovert. People say i brighten the workplace and am fun to be around. However, when I am at work, I get about 2 near panic attacks a day. No one would be able to tell this though except that I do get a little edgy. I constantly think my coworkers are thinking bad thoughts about me or that they are talking bad about me behind my back. Its plagues me and follows me 24/7. I can't even have interactions with people any more. I latch on to innocent parts of conversations and twist and turn it into something that seems like an attack.

I keep realizing that I should have never been a mother or that my kid and husband would be better off if I just took off and disappeared. I suspect my husband thinks I'm crazy and just tolerates me while also thinking negative thoughts about me. 

I feel this impending psychotic break is coming. That a dramatic change needs to happen in my life or I may become more of a burden. 

I don't know what this is. Like I said, my whole life it was that I had depression and anxiety and the OCD was just a funny quirk. But now, as I reflect, I realize it may be the root cause of everything that is wrong with me.

486,,OCD,"TW: sexual assault, miscarriage, pregnancy




For some background, I do not want (at least bio) children and never have. I have had a miscarriage before due to an unplanned pregnancy. I am also a sexual assault survivor. All of those things could be contributing to this, but I just want to know if anyone else struggles with this or has any suggestions on how to mitigate this. 

I have always experienced this and only recently thought that this could potentially be either caused entirely by my OCD or at least made worse by it. 

Any time I have sex, I get INTENSE fear that I am pregnant. This anxiety is to the point that I have often caused my periods to be late, which only exacerbates the fear.

I have been on birth control before, and the phobia was still there because of that .01% chance a person can get pregnant on birth control. With any contraceptive I use, I extensively research. Of course, no method (except abstinence lol) is 100% effective, and I always find myself struggling to enjoy sex or feeling “dirty” after sex partially because I am so scared that I will get pregnant. 

The anxiety about being pregnant and obsessiveness about checking stats and basically begging my period to start is really detrimental to my life. It’s been detrimental to relationships before due to me not wanting to have sex.

497,,OCD," 

Hi everyone! I have suffer from OCD for around 6 six years. The theme of my OCD is about masturbation. I always have the scene of masturbation in the public area. During these six years, the most severe stage of my OCD is the first two years. At the time, I was suffered from instantly false memory, urge and impulse and false memory OCD. I also have vivid images in my mind. I can not distinguish the difference between a through and an action. It is because no matter you act out these actions or not, you brain still pretend it really happens. Also, when you try to retrieve your memory, you can only retrieve your false memory scene or nothing. It seems like the RAM of my brain was disappear. I can not remember the actions I acted out, which was just a few seconds ago.

Regarding to the physical compulsion behaviors, I always check whether I am wearing my trousers or not within a certain interval of time. It is because I have the impulse of taking off my trousers off and do some embarrassing actions. In some occasions, such as shopping center and school, I do produce more false memories and compulsion. Sometimes, through action fusion and false memory can be formed at the same instance. For example, when I experience an intrusive through and impluse, I will pull my trousers in a slightly manner and pretend I am pulling off my trousers intentionally. At the same, I experience a physcual sensation on my skin because of these movements. Meanwhile, vivid images will form in my brain and I have no idea of what I am doing at that present because I was suffer from foggy memory at that moment. After the whole process, when I reforcus my mind into the present ""realty"", which is the real world situation. I was shocked, I thought I acted out some of the following actions: take off my trouses, masturbation, doing some embrassing behaviors and take on my trouses. In other words, when I refocus into the present ""realty"", it just like I have already resumed into the the situation very similar before the through action fusion begins, such as sit properly and did nothing. Sometimes, you can experience physcial sensation even if you do not carring out physcial compulsion. The reason why I will try to simulate the action of pulling off my trouses is because I will to experience the differences between through and action. Also, the pure ocd makes think that if I really carry out these actions, I will be releaxed from the anxiety. However, the more I do reassurance and do these simulation actions. I produce more anxiety about my OCD and the simulation. I worried about what if I really acting out these thought during the simulation. Also, it is possible that I am crazy and really acting out these thought to realse my pressures without considering any consequences.

Under some circumstances, OCD will not make you feel anxious and pressure but it makes you feel relax instead. In these situation, what I worry about is that:

NO1:  
Why did not experiencing any anxiety at all?

NO2:  
Will I I act out these through automatically ? It is because it makes me feel I am safe and just like I am at home.

NO3: OCD can fake my subconscious and say "" Here is your home and you can masturbate here. You can use your OCD bug which is the foggy memory to fake your mind. You can pretend the people around you do not exist or it does not mattet, you just masturbation at all cost.

The reason why I am scared is because sometimes you really did something but you can not remember. For example, in real life situation, sometimes you can not remember what you have said before just a few seconds ago. One example is that my lecturer did not remember what he was talking about after he answered the question raised by one of my schoolmate. Also, OCD can merge different memories into one memory. It can exaggerate the situation. For example, a few seconds later after you tied your shoelaces, OCD makes your think that you take off your schoes and socks and wear them back and tie your shoelaces. It makes me feel crazy.

Fortunately, I did lesser and lesser compulsion in these days, I know the term of thought and fusion and magical thinking. I know that when I was severe in OCD situations. It just like a blind people walking down the road. The ultimate decision is under your control. I can decide at that second but I can not rely on any of my memory even a few seconds ago.

The problem is that will I harm myself even I notice what I am doing at that particular second? Will I hurt myself even I know I am hurting myself in terms of real situations at all cost. In other words, I am huring myself physiologically even I notice the real alert signal with clear mind but not the falsely signal of the OCD.

Now, I also suffer from OCD. I did not produce any new themes, but as a OCD sufferer, I suffer the OCD that OCD the past OCD. If the theme of my past OCD is washing my hands, I will not OCD that OCD. However, my theme is about masturbation. I really want to cry.

Q1.Did anyone experience what I have experienced?

Q2.Did anyone use a video recorder to recoder their own behavior before ?

For example, you wrote down your OCD thought action fusion and the things that OCD makes you think you have done and view the video and see whether you have done these action or not.😭😭😭😭

At last, I want say foggy memory is horrible. Now I am seeing cp and mental docotor. I really want to know the answers of the last two questions Q1 and Q2.

- i tend to act weird, like socially awkward. I tend to sometimes overthink every little movement i do. From getting up from a chair, to walking and talking. I just examine every little thing i do to mot screw myself up.

- i always had trouble with sleeping. It's hard for me to just relax and take a nap and it took me almost an hour to fall asleep. Lately I've been having sleep deprivation and it's killing me man.

502,,OCD,"My bedroom is currently infested with ants. I've been spotting them occasionally for months but about two weeks ago it got really bad and they started getting into my bed. Monday night I had a full on panicking, sobbing breakdown because they were in my bed and nothing feels clean or safe or sacred anymore. An exterminator came on Tuesday and put out some stuff that would draw them all out of the wall and then kill the whole colony. It's Saturday now and it's getting better but they're still everywhere, including the bed.

504,,OCD,"Hi everyone! I have suffer from OCD for around 6 six years.
The theme of my OCD is about masturbation. I always have the scene of masturbation in the public area.  During these six years,  the most severe stage of my OCD is the first two years.  At the time, I was suffered from instantly false memory,   urge and impulse and false memory OCD. I also have vivid images in my mind. I can not distinguish the difference between a through and an action. It is because no matter you act out these actions or not, you brain still pretend it really happens. Also, when you try to retrieve your memory, you can only retrieve your false memory scene or nothing. It seems like the RAM of my brain was disappear. I can not remember the actions I acted out, which was just a few seconds ago. 

Regarding to the physical compulsion behaviors, I always check whether I am wearing my trousers or not within a certain interval of time. It is because I have the impulse of taking off my trousers off and do some embarrassing actions. In some occasions,  such as shopping center and school, I do produce more false memories and compulsion. 
Sometimes, through action fusion and false memory can be formed at the same instance. For example, when I experience an intrusive through and impluse, I will pull my trousers in a slightly manner and pretend I am pulling off my trousers intentionally. At the same, I experience a physcual sensation on my skin because of these movements. Meanwhile, vivid images will form in my brain and I have no idea of what I am doing at that present because I was suffer from foggy memory at that moment. After the whole process, when I reforcus my mind into the present ""realty"", which is the real world situation. I was shocked, I thought I acted out some of the following actions: take off my trouses, masturbation, doing some embrassing behaviors and take on my trouses. In other words, when I refocus into the present ""realty"", it just like I have already resumed into the the situation very similar before the through action fusion begins,  such as sit properly and did nothing. Sometimes, you can experience physcial sensation even if you do not carring out physcial compulsion. The reason why I will try to simulate the action of pulling off my trouses is because I will to experience the differences between through and action. Also, the pure ocd makes think that if I really carry out these actions, I will be releaxed from the anxiety. However, the more I do reassurance and do these simulation actions. I produce more anxiety about my OCD and the simulation. I worried about what if I really acting out these thought during the simulation. Also, it is possible that I am crazy and really acting out these thought to realse my pressures without considering any consequences. 

Under some circumstances, OCD will not make you feel anxious and pressure but it makes you feel relax instead. In these situation, what I worry about is that:

NO1:   
Why did not experiencing any anxiety at all?

NO2:  
Will I I act out these through automatically ?
It is because it makes me feel I am safe and just like I am at home.

NO3:
OCD can fake my subconscious and say "" Here is your home and you can masturbate here. You can use your OCD bug which is the foggy memory to fake your mind. You can pretend the people around you do not exist or it does not mattet, you just masturbation at all cost.

The reason why I am scared is because sometimes you really did something but you can not remember. For example, in real life situation, sometimes  you can not remember what you have said before just a few seconds ago. One example is that my lecturer did not remember what he was talking about after he answered the question raised by one of my schoolmate.  Also, OCD can merge different memories into one memory. It can exaggerate the situation. For example,  a few seconds later after you tied your shoelaces,  OCD makes your think that you take off your schoes and socks and wear them back and tie your shoelaces. It makes me  feel crazy.

Fortunately, I did lesser and lesser compulsion in these days, I know the term of thought and fusion and magical thinking. I know that when I was severe in OCD situations. It just like a blind people walking down the road. The ultimate decision is under your control. I can decide at that second but  I can not rely on any of my memory even a few seconds ago. 

The problem is that will I harm myself even I notice what I am doing at that particular second? Will I hurt myself even I know I am hurting myself in terms of real situations at all cost. In other words, I am huring myself physiologically even I notice the real alert signal with clear mind but not the falsely signal of the OCD.

Now, I also suffer from OCD. I did not produce any new themes, but as a OCD sufferer, I suffer the  OCD that OCD  the past OCD. 
If the theme of my past OCD is washing my hands, I will not OCD that OCD. However, my theme is about masturbation. I really want to cry.

Q1.Did anyone experience what I have experienced? 

Q2.Did anyone use a video recorder to recoder their own behavior before ?

For example, you wrote down your OCD thought action fusion and the things that OCD makes you think you have done and view the video and see whether you have done these action or not.😭😭😭😭
 
At last, I want say  foggy memory is horrible. Now I am seeing cp and mental docotor. I really want to know the answers of the last two questions Q1 and Q2.

Hey guys,

So tried to stay off this for a while as i used to be on this for hours every single day. Recently over last couple of days I have really wound myself up so much with anxiety due to my fears and thoughts. I’m stuck in a loop of fears of schizophrenia. All the obsessive thoughts like what if people want to hurt me, what if government are out to get me, what if my food is poisoned or my family have poisoned it. Causing absolutely horrible spikes of anxiety. I try and rationalise it everytime but it seems to grow even stronger. I never realised anxiety could cause thoughts like this, I’ve been obsessing over this for around 3 months now and my thoughts come and go and usually die down at night but in the morning they just ramp up. The bad thing is I don’t know if anyone else does this but I feel like I think of the thoughts on purpose to see if I react to them or I’ll create the scenario or thought in my head? Does anyone else do this? One more thing do intrusive thoughts always start with “what if” or can they start with anything?? For example instead of “what if the foods poisoned” just before I eat it I’ll maybe have the thought like “it’s poisoned don’t eat it” which then freaks me out because it’s not a what if thought. Just wondering if anyone can relate or has any advice on this? Plus anything I read I seem to latch onto an example of this would be I read that a schizophrenic once said that something went wrong with something they were doing and they blamed someone else for it saying “they’re in on it” right after this is shook me to the core and I started worrying about that thinking “what if they’re in on it against me” absolutely rubbish because there was nothing for anyone to be in on but my thoughts just jumped to that because it was a symptom of what I read about what this person said who had schizophrenia. Can anxiety and OCD do this or am I schizophrenic for having these thoughts? I’m fed up of questioning and rationalising every thought but I feel as if I have to do it mentally to try and calm my thoughts and fears down.

508,,OCD,"(Sexual tmi here guys so please be aware before reading) 

Hey guys, I just have some questions about HOCD I was hoping you guys may have the answer to. I realized that I was a lesbian when I was 15. My family is quite homophobic so I didn’t come out until last year (I am now 20) and I guess there was a lot of internalized homophobia growing up because of my family situation. So anyway, I’ve been diagnosed with OCD and I have a lot of harm OCD intrusive thoughts and such but one thing I’ve also had my whole life is sexual orientation intrusive thoughts. Ever since I realized I liked girls it got much worse. I constantly question myself. I don’t feel attraction toward guys but I constantly check if I do. When I’m not having the intrusive thoughts, I’m confident in my sexuality and I feel fine and guys really do not do anything for me in that way. However, when I’m having these thoughts, I’m questioning my sexuality, constantly trying to think of guys or put myself into situations in my head to check my reaction to them, and what’s worse is I even feel arousal at times when I experience these intrusive thoughts despite otherwise thinking that the situation would be gross. It’s the arousal too that really gets to me because it makes me think “oh great so this must mean I really am into guys sexually, that’s gross. I don’t want this” and then I start to panic. I even purposefully imagine situations to see if I will get aroused only to feel extremely ashamed afterwards when I in fact will experience arousal. It’s been awful and even during sexual experiences I’ve had with women these intrusive thoughts will occur during it and it ruins it for me because I’ll be thinking “what if this means I want a guy instead? What if I don’t actually like women? Why when I’m experiencing sexual experiences/orgasm/arousal do guys pop up in my head?” and it really bugs me. The thoughts will either cause arousal like I said and/or they gross me out so much i will literally feel sick to my stomach. A few times it’s gotten so bad to a point where I just tell people I’m bisexual because I am so confused by these thoughts and I don’t want to be lying about my sexuality to others and sometimes just saying I’m bisexual to myself makes the thoughts go away because it’s like I’m not fighting them anymore if that makes sense?

&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, I just have some questions about HOCD I was hoping you guys may have the answer to. I realized that I was a lesbian when I was 15. My family is quite homophobic so I didn’t come out until last year (I am now 20) and I guess there was a lot of internalized homophobia growing up because of my family situation. So anyway, I’ve been diagnosed with OCD and I have a lot of harm OCD intrusive thoughts and such but one thing I’ve also had my whole life is sexual orientation intrusive thoughts. Ever since I realized I liked girls it got much worse. I constantly question myself. I don’t feel attraction toward guys but I constantly check if I do. When I’m not having the intrusive thoughts, I’m confident in my sexuality and I feel fine and guys really do not do anything for me in that way. However, when I’m having these thoughts, I’m questioning my sexuality, constantly trying to think of guys or put myself into situations in my head to check my reaction to them, and what’s worse is I even feel arousal at times when I experience these intrusive thoughts despite otherwise thinking that the situation would be gross. It’s the arousal too that really gets to me because it makes me think “oh great so this must mean I really am into guys sexually, that’s gross. I don’t want this” and then I start to panic. I even purposefully imagine situations to see if I will get aroused only to feel extremely ashamed afterwards when I in fact will experience arousal. It’s been awful and even during sexual experiences I’ve had with women these intrusive thoughts will occur during it and it ruins it for me because I’ll be thinking “what if this means I want a guy instead? What if I don’t actually like women? Why when I’m experiencing sexual experiences/orgasm/arousal do guys pop up in my head?” and it really bugs me. The thoughts will either cause arousal like I said and/or they gross me out so much i will literally feel sick to my stomach. A few times it’s gotten so bad to a point where I just tell people I’m bisexual because I am so confused by these thoughts and I don’t want to be lying about my sexuality to others and sometimes just saying I’m bisexual to myself makes the thoughts go away because it’s like I’m not fighting them anymore if that makes sense? It just is almost a way for me to be like “okay whatever sure, I’ll just say I’m bisexual then. Please stop” even though it doesn’t sit right with me. I don’t understand why this happens and I guess I’m just wondering if this is OCD or if I actually like guys. Does anyone else experience this or something similar? This is really embarrassing for me to post about and I apologize, I don’t really know who to talk to about this and I don’t know anyone else with OCD who I could confide in about it.&lt;/p&gt;

511,,OCD,"Tw: Self harm

I have a lot of rules when it comes to numbers and sounds. I'm writing this post as a bit of a confessional as I feel quite ashamed of how much this disorder has taken control of my life. 

I have misophonia and if I hear a trigger sound I have to pinch my thigh 3, 5, or 7 times depending on what it is. The pain of the pinch ""cures"" the repulsed feeling I got from hearing the sound in the first place. But lately the pain has not felt like a cure enough and I'm scared I'll relapse into more extreme self harming, and I've also found myself pinching 3 times for any feeling of disgust, not just the trigger noises. For example I was watching a TV show with a grisly scene and had to pinch. It's getting fairly warm outside but I have to wear long pants all the time to cover the bruises from the pinching.

I also have a fear/superstition around the number 4. When I'm grocery shopping I can only buy 3 or 5 of an item. This used to be an inconvenience but lately I have been applying the ""rule"" to factors and multiples of 4 as well. For example I won't buy 2 because 2x2 is 4. I won't buy 12 because 3x4 is 12. Thankfully I am financially stable but it costs me a lot more over time to follow these arbitrary rules. If I'm eating something and there's 5 pieces left, I'll eat 2 at once to leave 3 behind so I don't have to ""land"" on 4. If I accidentally end up with 4 of something it causes extreme anxiety and panic attacks, sometimes including pinching or scratching myself as well to ""wash away"" the disgust. I don't know how pain became the opposite of disgust in my mind but that's how it is. 

I don't get out of bed if the number 4 is on the clock. I try to avoid looking at the clock when I know there will be a 4. If I see it my heart starts to race and I get a feeling of dread. Usually I can tamp it down and not have an immediate reaction but this past week I had to call in sick as I woke up around 3:30am and then couldn't fall back to sleep before 4am, therefore I ended up staying awake until 5:05 which I felt was a ""safe"" number and I was able to close my eyes and drift off.

The room has also been cusping on being a health hazard and the smell has been seeping under her door into the main area for weeks, the cat litter box was full and there was old food and rubbish everywhere..it was bad. But i know what depression is like so I don't judge her for ""letting it get that way"". I knew asking her to clean it would have started a fight and a response of its none of my business. Which i know it isnt. The smell was, but the room isnt. Besides I wanted her to feel better. Needless to say it did not turn out that way.

I know it was crossing a line. I know I wouldn't particularly like it if someone did it to/for me. I would feel uneasy and ask that they not do it again. 

But the impulse won. I feel like I did something nice but also something wrong. I knew it was crossing a big boundary. I didn't go through any personal items nor did I take anything. I still knew that it wasn't right even though i didnt do either of those things.

She is very upset with me, very very upset. And says she doesn't trust me anymore. Which is fair enough, I understand that.

I feel horrible and don't know how to fix it. A big part of me feels like I have to make up for crossing a boundary but another (smaller) part feels like I will be doing more when I already did something.

Similar things happen at work too when someone wants me to do something else and to organise something later. But I do it because they always say that and it always stays messy then I cant find something easily or have quick access to it if i need it. I do realise that cleaning things up at work is different than going into someones personal space. But I mentioned both because both situations are impacting mine and others lives negatively and im constantly stuck in a spiral of shame and for something that (cleaning/organising) isn't typically a negative thing or something one usually feels shameful for.

Sorry if this is a bit long, will try to keep it short!

Does anyone else really struggle when it comes to other people using the bathroom and trusting they washed their hands? This is where my current issue is starting.

So, basically i work with a close friend, and twice in the last few years, ive seen him leave public bathrooms and not wash his hands (he said he feels the taps are dirty). he knows about my ocd and i think he has been better with hand washing (although at work the other day he used the bathroom when there was no soap in there...)

Today i was at his house as we needed to sort something out for work. He has a new pet who i know has made mess in the house previously, so im getting thoughts of what if it peed or peed on the chair i sat on. I didnt worry to much as my normal routine to make myself feel comfortable, would be to chuck my clothes in the wash basket when i get home and shower, as i get paranoid i could have urine or faeces on my from being at his. I did those things when i got home, and this evening i planned to go to to the shops, but when i got to my car i got all these thoughts of what if there is urine or faeces on my car seat, or on my seat belt from my jumper i wore to his, and i cant get myself to get in my car...

I keep trying to rationalise it and say there wont be anything there, but im so scared there will be and im gonna end up bringing it into my sofa and in my house if i sit in that car seat. 

I guess im posting here as i need an outlet and i dont what else to do as im on a waiting list for therapy currently to help. Is this all just crazy, im so scared of something being in my car, then itll get on my sofa and spread untill everything is contaminated. 

I know some people may think i made it worse by going to my friends house which is fair, but they are such a close friend and i dont want to let ocd ruin this. Ocd already ruins so much, i dont want it to stop me being able to do a simple thing of going to a friends house you know?

559,,OCD,"TW: panic attacks, panic disorder, BPD

I think my OCD/AvPD whombo combo is driven by a deep-seated fear of rejection and abandonment.  
The fear of having to be able to fully thrive on my own, with nothing and nobody but me to blame for my suffering.

OCD (at least for me) is the desperate need to address something that is completely outside of my sphere of influence. So far outside in fact, that I can comfortably distract myself from some unaddressed trauma that's festering much closer to home.

Every time I obsess about something or do any type of compulsion, I am taking the scenic route to my destination. It's not really efficient and it's a bumpy ride, but at least I can arrive a little later and avoid my responsibilities a tiny bit longer.

Instead of confronting my primal fear of abandonement and dedicating myself to overcoming it,  
I am remaining in denial of an uncomfortable truth.  
Unfortunately my name is not Cypher. My ignorance is not blissful at all.  
It's easier for me to give in than to stand my ground and do the hard work.  
It's easier to blame a mental disorder than to face my demons.  
It's easier to receive pointless suffering than to actively recover.

I guess growing hurts not only in a physical sense, but also on a psychological level.  
Aching backs and stretching legs have been replaced by emotional turmoil.

Also I think that tics may be a sudden urge to recalibrate your emotions when the anxiety suddenly spikes and threatens to become too much to handle. Maybe they're some sort of reflex to prevent a full blown panic attack, because for me they definitely reset my ability to cope with my emotions.

Does anyone else feel similar with their OCD or OCD-related disorder?

570,,OCD,"Hello, I'm going to describe you my situation. So, I think my OCD began a few years ago when I heard about HIV in elementary school. I only knew that it can be transmitted via semen or blood, which I got extreme obsessive thoughts about. I thought that if my semen touches my wound I'll get HIV (which makes no sense and I wonder how I even managed not to find that out at that time). I searched the web all the time about it. It went away somehow. Later, summer before the thoughts in the title, I saw that before bedtime I was constantly doing things in a compulsive way like : 1. brush teeth then smile 3 times at the mirror 2. check dog outside if he is asleep 3. drink water until you reach the number you count in your head etc. Then, when it was time to vaccinate my dog, I researched the web about rabies and vaccines. After that, I got extreme obsessive thoughts about it and I constantly checked my dog (Golden retriever). Then the fear went extreme and I was afraid to touch anything, if I did I had to wash the part of my body that touched it ( not so good if you have eczema). I overcame that by exposure therapy when I worked with a relative of mine (he thought it was a good idea if I worked with him) . After that, with the thoughts present, I left the house and after locking the door I turn my back and a bat flies right in front of me ( about 1,5m or 5 feet) and since I developed the sense to constantly feel that something spits or touches me, I ran inside the house to check. Went to the mirror and I saw something wet on my mustache ( I drank water before), and I got so scared, I screamed, cried, wanted to get vaccinated ( Rabies is transmitted via bite or lick, not by some animal spitting you). After that I always check behind me if something touched me or if there were bats on the street, I am afraid when somebody opens the front door that a bat would fly in and that I wont see it.

Since the approval of the Covid vaccine, I have had daily obsessions/intrusive thoughts that I would go into anaphylactic shock/die from receiving the vaccine- something far removed from reality (I've never even had an anaphylactic reaction to anything). Counter this with daily thoughts of dying from contracting Covid, I was between a rock and a hard place. Die from Covid or die from the vaccine? 

Yesterday, I had a Covid vaccine appointment. I decided to use the technique, ""radical acceptance"", used in DBT, up to my 4:15 appointment (a morning appointment to spend less time working myself up would have been preferable but I'll take what I can get), and it worked. I waited 30 minutes after the shot for observation and was able to not only not obsess during this time about anaphylactic symptoms, but not drive myself into panic. 

I wish I could tell myself my past self that the torture I was putting myself through was for nothing, but alas, that is part of the ongoing journey of dealing with OCD.

As with most parts of my OCD, I struggle to know what is “normal” and what is my OCD exaggerating things. Like, it _is_ normal for people to wash their hands after eating popcorn and not touch their keyboard or phone while eating popcorn, right? But I also have a hard time eating things that aren’t really greasy, like apples and bread, and feel like I should wash my hands after eating bread because my hands feel greasy. If I make toast with butter, I have to make sure to wash my hands thoroughly until the greasy feeling is gone. I’m not making up that my hands are greasy—they *are*—but are normal people who don’t have this kind of OCD fine with having greasy hands?

My brother eats food while on his computer and doesn’t wash his hands. He’ll eat chips or toast and just keep using his computer. Whereas I have to wash my hands or at least wipe it on something if I even touch my hair because I have greasy hair. And I have greasy skin, so if I touch my face or body, my hands feel greasy. I think that greasiness is a real feeling and not something my mind makes up, but surely it’s not normal to have to wash your hands even if your hands are slightly greasy, right?

I am terrified of having greasy hands and spreading that to my belongings. I have to wipe my phone with a wet microfiber cloth every time I wake up because it gets greasy from having it next to me in bed, and I usually shower after waking up because I feel so greasy. I think my greasy body and hair is a combination of stress/anxiety and not getting enough nutrition, as I haven’t been eating right due to depression, but I also have to wash my hands after touching things I perceive to be greasy, like my stove—or after I’ve made dinner or have eaten dinner.

602,,OCD,"Hey everybody,

My girlfriend has OCD and went through some pretty intense treatment a couple years back, and now she's doing great! 

I don't have OCD myself so my explanation might not be great, but from what she explained to me, she has the type where she'll have these very intrusive thoughts that scare her.

For example, even though she's heterosexual, she'll walk past another girl and think about how pretty/attractive that girl is while she's with me, and feel confused about having that thought and also guilty because she's afraid she's wasting her/my time. To combat this, I'm pretty sure she did exposure therapy, where instead of fighting that thought, she'd instead welcome it and be like ""yeah, maybe I'm gay, so what?"" which normalized it in her head and made it less frightening.

It's done wonders for her, but now we're in a dilemma. We believe we may have uncovered some trust issues that lead back to her parents who were flaky and emotionally distant. This is great, but we don't know what kind of therapist to talk to in order to address these issues. 

The reason why is because if she goes to the same type of exposure therapist, she's afraid they might tell her that it's just another frightening ocd thought she has to normalize. On the other hand, if she just goes to a normal therapist, they might not be able to understand as easily how ocd may play a factor, and not really be able to help her.

606,,OCD,"So I've been dealing with obsessive thoughts for about seven months, all relating to whether or not I somehow sexually abused my girlfriend in my last relationship (which ended around last May). I've sought reassurance on just about every last issue I could think of, and even when my ex explicitly told me that I had never done anything wrong (her words), it failed to make me feel better, because the ""memories"" still felt so vivid and real, even when she said they were mistaken. So I decided to actually go back to therapy for the first time in several years.

610,,OCD,"Hi, so I’m a positive person. I pride myself in being a positive influence on those around me. I also have obsessive think that comes and goes. Anyway, two years ago i started to casually use an online chat site called ‘talk with stranger’. It was just something to go with porn, like talking to a stranger anonymously was just something I’d do sometimes. Of course most people on these sites are also men looking for a woman to have a quick sexual chat with. So id skip the men. It was an escape and I didn’t think of it as me as it was anonymous so I’d do it then wake up and have good times with family friends like that never happened, no big deal. 

Anyway I’ve been really happy lately and also barely ever used that site anymore, certainly not now. But the other day my OCD kicked in. My OCD thinking sometimes makes me think of the world as concrete black and white and statistically. And now I feel so dirty and ashamed because I value myself in my positive interactions but my brain won’t let me stop thinking that I only meet a certain amount of people I do good for and that may be statistically low compared to the ‘M or F? m *skip*’ interactions on that site. 


So I feel like yeah I may be friendly to someone on the street, and friends and family and people I meet but then I also had a so many interactions where it was ‘m or f? M *skip*’ (it’s easy to just skip so u go through a lot of people)

631,,OCD,"-TRIGGER WARNING-

-TRIGGER WARNING-

-TRIGGER WARNING-

I don’t know if this is a huge trigger for others but for me even the mention of this word can cause very long agonising cycles. I have a weird symptom where I can get stuck in a loop of constant yawning. The two reasons I believe that it is an OCD symptom is because it can be triggered by just the mention of breathing and because it is very dependant of things feeling “just right”. If I even have the thought of breathing my breath will automatically be switched to manual breathing which is absolutely torturous as it will continue for as long as I am thinking about it and OCD makes it very hard to forget. I will have to yawn about every ten seconds and often I will get “failed yawns” like a yawn that didn’t work and didn’t give me the satisfaction of an ordinary yawn. This gives me an indescribable but absolutely horrible feeling and it will make me need to yawn again straight after. I also get feelings all over my body that things need to be just right. As a random example I’ll touch me left leg, then adjust my arm position, move my right arm up and so on. This may be influenced by my Tourette’s syndrome. If I can’t do all of those things and make the feelings go away, the yawn will be unsuccessful. Just to emphasise the sensitivity of the trigger for this, I have been in the yawning/manual breathing loop the entire time I have been writing this.

If I even have the thought of breathing my breath will automatically be switched to manual breathing which is absolutely torturous as it will continue for as long as I am thinking about it and OCD makes it very hard to forget. I will have to yawn about every ten seconds and often I will get “failed yawns” like a yawn that didn’t work and didn’t give me the satisfaction of an ordinary yawn. This gives me an indescribable but absolutely horrible feeling and it will make me need to yawn again straight after. I also get feelings all over my body that things need to be just right. As a random example I’ll touch me left leg, then adjust my arm position, move my right arm up and so on. This may be influenced by my Tourette’s syndrome. If I can’t do all of those things and make the feelings go away, the yawn will be unsuccessful. Just to emphasise the sensitivity of the trigger for this, I have been in the yawning/manual breathing loop the entire time I have been writing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have lost countless hours of sleep over this and it can has gotten to the point where it is mental torture and I have given up on trying to sleep and just gotten up at 4 am and had a coffee and watch tv or go for a walk until the sun comes up.&lt;/p&gt;

634,,OCD,"So this is kind of similar to intrusive thoughts that I think some people with OCD struggle with. Like you think of a terrible thing you'd never do but then feel terrible for thinking it, then you obsess over it...

Anyway. I had a very weird thought earlier today. I noticed that in my mouthwash the cap had tiny little black specks, I thought that was weird and then the next day I thought. *""What if my landlords are trying to poison me?""* They have no ill will towards me, they are good and decent people, and trying to kill me by poison me using my mouthwash cap is a really inefficient way to do so.

So now I feel weird. I feel crazy for even entertaining the thought, and now my OCD won't let go of said thought lol. To be honest, I don't know if this counts as OCD, I've heard of Pure-O (where it's just the obsession portion, minus the compulsion part, but I guess thinking about it and going on Reddit could be a compulsion? idk). Nonetheless, I do have OCD, some fairly bad anxiety, and depression.

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this and just get my mind off of this?

I am in therapy and will be seeing my doctor on Monday about the possibility of getting on some anti-anxiety meds and maybe something targeted at the OCD.

635,,OCD,"Okay. Phew. This is a long one and it’s my first time on here. This is my story. As to whether this all truly is all OCD or not I honestly do not know and all I want is to just get better cause I’m sick of waking up everyday not able to be able to feel like I’m living. When I was a kid, I always did weird shit. I don’t mean that in a totally negative way or anything. My thinking was really just black and white, basic, I liked everything in a system. I liked everything to be seen through and experienced perfectly. If I read a book, played a video game, or watched a movie, I had to make sure I was viewing it right. I had to be in the right mindset, I had to hear and understand each word. I had to do everything 100 percent in a game. It was just the way I did things. I never noticed any anxiety with it but it got worse when I would inevitably fail. It escalated to having this thing where I would wanna restart my life perfectly and do everything right. I wanted to be the absolute best I could be. I got bad in middle school. I got obsessed with the concept of morality. Like I couldn’t think or do anything. I couldn’t eat chicken or meat without obsessing over is it right to eat animals? Are we good people? Etc. it got worse and worse. Everyday almost I kept resetting and resetting. I had this mental ritual where everyday at exactly 6:00 pm I would try to perfectly restart my life and delete all my social media, video game files, and try to do it all over again just perfectly and to where it felt just “right” and epic. This was my life All throughout elementary and middle school. It sucked. I never got to truly get that perfect start and because of that I never got to just live in those moments and feel as though I was living. It wasn’t all bad however. There was so many amazing things and the friends I had I’ll never forget. When high school came, I began to try and get it together. I learned briefly what ocd was and by then I had already come to terms in my head that okay I’m just really different. I wasn’t anxious about it. I was a little worried yeah but when I heard what it was I told my friend and he said yeah that sounds like ocd. This is where the story is going to go for a full 180 so bear with me. In 2016 I was in high school and I was in this really manipulative relationship. I was honestly really messed up obsessing whether or not I could trust her when I learned and saw she had lied and used to me and had a big time victim personality. I’ll spare the details but one night I felt so terrible that the next day I woke up and I couldn’t feel anything. Not happy or sad or anything and I started obsessing about it. I couldn’t tell whether I was making myself think I was or not. I definitely “felt” like I was. But after that for a full year it was an utter and absolutely terrifying life for me. My obsessions got terrifying. I was having intrusive thoughts that I was a danger to people, that I was gonna snap and at any moment I could harm or hurt someone, I had intrusive sexual thoughts of the people that I loved and cared about, I was scared I was gay( my attraction for girls was super strong all throughout middle and high school until that incident and I never felt attracted to anyone. Just nothingness. I had nothing at all against being gay. I just did not want to lose how much I loved girls. It just wasn’t me or what I identify as as heterosexual.) My junior year I got put on Prozac and in 3 months of summer I felt so much better. The thoughts left. I wasn’t 100 percent cured but it was easier. I later was taken off of it and for a year or so I was fine. Flash forward to 6 months ago. It’s gotten so much worse. First all the terrifying intrusive thoughts from then returned and it was really hard but I pulled through. Now is here where I’m at now and this is where I have no idea how to move forward. My obsession with perfect starts and just living my life to the best of my ability is eating me alive. All I want to do is always make the right choice but I dont know if this is all me. Am I truly trying to be a good person or is it just cause my ocd is forcing me to? Am I going to be the same person after treatment? I really really hope I aim to do great things and be selfless and help others. I really do. Lately I had a massive anxiety spike a few days ago. I was playing the original donkey Kong on switch. A super very BASIC GAME right? I couldn’t do it. I have this thing where in my mind I can’t get the full experience out of a game unless I play the absolute first game in the series that came first with that feeling of “okay I did this perfect the way it should be”, I also have to know everything about its development cycle and I need to 100 percent the game. Donkey Kong is a super simple game but in my head I said okay I need to jump over 5 barrels on this first floor then 5 on the second then 5 on the third and I have to get all the items and I have to play it like I’m really in the game and it’s real life and I have to make the right choice and - you see why I’m really really freaking out right?

January 1st. In my head last year I said okay 1/1/2021 sound so perfect and feels right to start fresh. When I was in middle school I was set in my head that I had to learn everything. I would obsessively read and restart taking notes in textbooks from school if I didn’t feel I was learning and taking in everything “right”. Honestly, as I’m writing this, I feel kinda anxious in my chest. It’s like my anxiety is throwing up all over this electronic keypad. Neat huh? Basically I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I don’t know why I’m like this.

 So I decided to try NAC after reading a few small studies that say it helps. It is a supplement that affects glutamate in the brain and can be bought over the counter. I found no difference at the recommended dose (2400mg a day) so I upped it to 3600 and my mind is very quiet. The intrusive thoughts are less frequent, the background chatter is mostly gone, and the constant rush of uncontrollable thoughts is just silent, as is the creeping sense of dread. I don't fall into ruminations, which used to last 4-6 hours a day at my worst. OCD had infiltrated every corner of my life, but now it's just.... quiet?

&lt;p&gt;So I decided to try NAC after reading a few small studies that say it helps. It is a supplement that affects glutamate in the brain and can be bought over the counter. I found no difference at the recommended dose (2400mg a day) so I upped it to 3600 and my mind is very quiet. The intrusive thoughts are less frequent, the background chatter is mostly gone, and the constant rush of uncontrollable thoughts is just silent, as is the creeping sense of dread. I don&amp;#39;t fall into ruminations, which used to last 4-6 hours a day at my worst. OCD had infiltrated every corner of my life, but now it&amp;#39;s just.... quiet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only issue I have with NAC is that it doesn&amp;#39;t last very long, so I&amp;#39;ve been taking them at 7am, 12pm and 5pm. Anyone else have experience with it?&lt;/p&gt;

644,,OCD,"Hey, I’d like to start off by saying that my libido is EXTREMELY high and I watch a f*ck ton of porn to the point where I can safely assume that I’m a full blown addict 😐

I’ve had a few sexual obsessions growing up but this one’s been bothering me on a whole different level. Therapist says it’s OCD but all I do is doubt, doubt, doubt. A few weeks ago I’ve been at probably the lowest point of my life where I have seriously considered suicide with the blade on my wrist and have gone way too far with this self harm shit. My OCD revolves around pedophilia... 

Now just to make this clear, as horny as I am, I only fantasise about women and girls my age which I do naturally, not because I choose to in order to prove anything to myself. I am 101% certain of my attraction to adult females because only I know how thirsty I can get at times lol. I have never fantasised about or had the slightest urge to do anything with a child. Even when I watch pornography and get intrusive thoughts I can feel myself getting turned off which eventually leads to, well... a bad orgasm. I find myself jerking off way too often lately because I can’t feel satisfied unless I get it right. I mean it literally hurts at this point. 

This is what’s constantly worrying me though: there are moments (rarely but still happens) when the thought pops up into my head and I feel like a tingling sensation. I have never managed to get the slightest erection from the thought but something tells me that I would be able to if I tried hard enough, which scares the sh*t out of me. I’ve said this to my therapist and she told me about conditioning and how because I’ve been having these thoughts while orgasming could lead to some sort of sexual reaction, which doesn’t mean I like the thought but what it reminds me of. Which is porn. This did bring some relief but I still can’t be sure of anything unfortunately. 

My worry isn’t about being an exclusive pedophile but the idea of there being even a very slight attraction makes me want to kill myself to be quite honest... now I’ve read a reply from a real pedophile saying that the reason POCD is a thing is because people don’t know what pedophilia is, and that a pedophile would always pick children over adults. But does that really have to be a rule? Why can’t it be the other way around? At the end of the day I’m assuming it’s a spectrum. Another thing is, if it was to be real surely I would’ve figured it out sooner, right? 

Anyway, I’ve been ranting a bit too much but I’m basically asking for reassurance which I know I shouldn’t be doing but oh well... lately I’ve been managing to deal with my anxiety by simply trying to ignore the thought, avoiding anything to do with children, repeating stuff to myself and all of that which surprisingly seems to work quite well, even though recently I realised that being anywhere near a child gives me extreme anxiety. 

Some info about myself:
I’m 16/male, obsession started around last year and lasted for about a week (nowhere near as intense as it’s been for these past 2 months) then kinda went dormant. Lately I’ve been a bit better by not exposing myself to the thought as much but I used to be getting very intense panic attacks, breakdowns and anxiety.

650,,OCD,"I honestly want to cry when I think about it. I started it optimistically and it's helped so much more than I ever imagined it could.

I still feel the impulse to do certain things (count everything 5 times for example) but.. it doesn't rule my entire life. I can forget about it. This is life changing.

One thing I didn't expect, is it makes me forget about picking my nails and skin. I've often had the thought that ""I will literally never reach a point in my life where I can stop picking my skin"" or something to that effect. I still kind of do it. I'm still fixated around my nails a little bit, except now it's growing them out instead of picking them. Also, still kind of messing them up in some ways that isn't picking. (Kind of hard to explain without a visual) There's one thing I used to do with my skin but it's too gross to mention.

655,,OCD,"Just venting because I’m very frustrated that I have to think like this...

I’ve had contamination ocd for a bit now, but it’s usually related to my hands and needing to wash them a lot. 

However recently it’s turned into fears about my face masks being contaminated. It started with something somewhat more reasonable, I used to always pull my mask down when I got in my car so that it was resting over my neck. One day I thought, “what if there’s Covid on your neck, and now you’re going to get it in your mask and breathe it in when you put it back on.” 

Scary thought, so I got back and left my mask out for a few days since Covid dies on surfaces after around that period of time. I use reusable cloth masks and have three of them. 

So, I have two others that I can use. Except now my contamination fears start to get absurd. I generally have contamination fears relating to viruses, molds, and toxic chemicals. 

So now that my fears have spread beyond my hands, it’s making things more difficult. For instance, after using chemicals to clean my bathroom, I wash my hands. But sometimes my brain tells me that not all the chemicals are off. I itch my face a lot at home, so after itching it, I get thoughts like what if it’s now contaminated my face, and then when I put my mask on, the mask will then be contaminated with chemicals which I will then breathe in constantly. 

I know. It’s absurd. But it’s frustrating because I get immense panic before I put my mask on to leave now. When it first started it got so bad that I just didn’t leave my house until I washed them all throughly. 

It’s just frustrating. I have a pack of throwaway surgical masks that I could use and do sometimes, but they don’t fit as well as my cotton masks so I don’t really like using them in public. 

I’m trying to fight this obsession though. I keep getting the urge to throw my masks in the washing machine after any trigger but I know that constantly doing it will wear down the masks and make them less effective in general...

I wish I could go back to when I didn’t have these contamination fears lol.

Researchers at Johns Hopkins are conducting a brief online survey about the effects of psilocybin in people who have used a moderate to high dose of psilocybin mushrooms (also called “magic mushrooms”) while taking an antidepressant medication, or within two years of stopping such treatment. Psilocybin is a compound that occurs naturally in certain species of mushrooms, and is currently being studied for its possible antidepressant effects. However, people who are currently using or have recently used antidepressants may react differently to psilocybin, and this interaction is not well understood. Your participation in this research study can help improve our understanding of how psilocybin works in people who have used antidepressant medications.

667,,OCD,"trigger warning: racism, intrusive racist thoughts

Hello all,

I've been having lots of thoughts about racism lately. I am still not sure if these are intrusive thoughts or not, but I want to be sure what the distinction between intrusive thoughts and actual racism are.

I was talking to a friend of mine about dating, and they told me something that was racist. They told me that they had a ""racial preference"" in dating and that they did not want to date black people. They told me that they felt uncomfortable around black people, and that they felt that black people usually talked in an aggressive manner that made them uncomfortable.

I felt a little bit put on the spot, but I tried to politely tell them what was wrong with their beliefs. I told them this ""preference"" was not the same thing as a sexual preference to a specific gender, and was instead affected by culture. I told them that not all black people talked in the ""aggressive"" way my friend said they talked like. I told them that dating black people is not intimidating in the way my friend was making it out to be, and that they should not avoid dating black people, because they may be missing out on an opportunity to meet someone that's perfect for them.  

It just scares me because I notice that I have acted uncomfortable around black people before, and it makes me think that I am not much different from my friend. I remember having a period of time where I was not extremely fixated on racist thoughts and a fear of acting racist. Of course I still had racist/sexist/homophobic/etc. thoughts and stereotypes in my head, but there was not the fear that came with the thoughts. I could avoid fixating on them like everyone else can.

Before I was super fixated on these thoughts, I could have a normal conversation with a black person without thinking about it. Once the thoughts gradually took over me, a conversation with a black person would make my face go red, I would think about how uncomfortable my stance, my facial expressions were, even looking at my expressions after conversations in a mirror to see if I was acting uncomfortable and racist. When I was walking down a hallway and saw a black person, I would think about all the ways my body could be acting to be uncomfortable and racist, which would make me feel uncomfortable, which is racist. I even struggled with not feeling extreme stress when looking at an image of a black person, because I would tell myself that I was perceiving them in a racist way, even if I did not think of any racist stereotypes.

What I've been trying to do to address this problematic behavior of mine is to start talking to black people when I am out in public.  I also noticed that breathing exercises from my Cognitive Behavioral Therapy that are aimed at my ADHD and Anxiety are weirdly helpful during stressful moments!

With one step at a time, I seem to be improving my behavior. When I first talked to black people while out in public, I would get so nervous that my face would go red, but over time I stopped having this problem. On my less anxious days and I am walking by a black person down the hallway, I can let go of my thoughts that are telling me how uncomfortable I must be acting around black people, and just walk down a hallway like a normal person! I do not feel extreme stress anymore when looking at a picture of a black person. 

Perhaps the difference between my friend and I is that I see acting uncomfortable around black people as a racist act that needs to be fixed and my friend does not? I try to talk to black people, and tell my therapist about my problem so that my therapist can help me to stop acting uncomfortable around black people, while my friend just tells themself that they are perfectly fine acting uncomfortable around black people, that this is a ""race-based preference"", and that this is ""what black people deserve"" for acting stereotypically black. But my guess is that my friend doesn't experience the same amount of anxiety with their ""discomfort"" as I do, and that they just see a black person, think of stereotypes about them, and never question those stereotypes.

What also scares me is that I notice that I sometimes have the thought ""I don't want to date a black person"" and then an stereotyped image of a black person in my head and how it would be ""so awful"" to date that stereotyped image. To respond to this thought, I would tell myself that I have seen racist stereotypes all my life, but that these thoughts are not reflective of what I believe. I have had crushes on black people and dated a black person before, so I know that I do not actually hate dating black people or am ""incapable"" of falling in love with a black person. I would also tell myself that not every black person fits the stereotypes of black people, and it is toxic to assume a person is a certain way because they are black. Black people face the emotional burden of those stereotypes, and black people are usually forced to go out of their way to avoid being perceived as that stereotype. So I now know that this thought is racist but not me, so I should just move on from the thought.

In other words, as a result of living in a racist society, it is normal for white people to have these racist thoughts and stereotypes in their heads. What matters is the *second* thought that comes after it: do I genuinely believe that this racist thought is true or do I correct myself for thinking of a racist stereotype? At the same time, I should not tell myself that I am a terrible person because I am having the thought, since then I will pressure myself not to think of the thought and then I will think of the thought even more.

Is this the appropriate way to approach these thoughts? I've been acting off-kilter for the past few years due to thoughts that are racist/homophobic/ableist/etc., and I've noticed that the intrusive thought approach towards my negative thoughts helps me to think of them less and get less anxiety over them. I just want to be sure that I am approaching this in the right direction and not acting the same way as my friend did.",t2_9nc5lmkx,False,,0,False,Intrusive Racist Thoughts and Racism?,[],r/OCD,False,0,,0,,False,t3_ly7vap,False,dark,1.0,,public,13,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,13,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1614963524.0,text,0,,,text,self.OCD,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;trigger warning: racism, intrusive racist thoughts&lt;/p&gt;

675,,OCD,"So I have mindfucked myself through a stupid decision I made last Saturday. 

After going on a walk in the afternoon and spending an hour trying to dodge dog shit whilst pushing the baby’s pram I noticed that I had a suspicious foreign entity on the the bottom of my shoe when I got home. Anyway it looked like dog shit.....not loads but enough.....so I scraped most of it off using a small block of wood laying about and sorta tossed it behind the shed, not properly so I kicked it further behind so my in my mind (later on that day) there is/was some loose dog poo in that area .

I made the stupid decision,  without thinking,to rub the remainder off on the grass in my garden. It was quite stubborn so it required a lot of foot wiping and I ended up rubbing through a large area of grass.....at the time I didn’t think it through.

Meltdown 1 - I stepped into my house, having already took my shoes off and by avoiding stepping on the back door mat I sorta lost my balance slightly....with my shoes in my hand and I became convinced that my shoe that I had just been rubbing furiously (side of the tread) touched me on my leg or belt or jacket/shirt and this triggered  my first OCD meltdown, I wasn’t certain if I did touch myself with the shoes and this in itself was driving me crazy. so I got undressed and completely froze as I didn’t know how to react or feel, especially about my belt....it’s not machine washable and was a gift from my partner for Christmas. I literally stood at the top of the stairs pretty much stripped and holding this belt down I couldn’t move. I felt stupid for needing and wanting to shower over it all yet I really wanted to cleanse myself. I told my partner what was going on and she thought I was being OTT....I probably was but my brain was melting down over it. She tried to convince me to just wash my hands but in the end I put the belt down the side of the wardrobe (it’s still there) and I jumped on the shower where I spent over an hour cleaning.

Meltdown 2 - Come Saturday night after my meltdown shower....... and it dawned on me.....we have 2 cats and all I could think about was the cats trodding through the areas where I rubbed my shoe ......1 of the areas is a definite where 1 of the cats passes through regularly to his sleeping spot...... now all I can think about is this dog shot being spread all around the house and it was too late, the cats have already been in and out a lot and I think it is everywhere...floor, carpets, their beds, back of the couch, window sills etc and because I think they have bought in....I am thinking me and my partner are spreading it further through walking through it and around the house....ITS EVERYWHERE!!! it was late and I couldn’t deal with it so I went to bed.

Meltdown 3 - Sunday morning, first thing I do in the morning is go into the garden and hose down the areas that are contaminated with dog poo....but first things first.....the hose nozzle has split from the recent frosty weather so it was not at full spraying strength....but I carried on and drenched the fuck out all the areas I could remember wiping my foot (I forgot about the piece of wood I used for scraping annoyingly) hoping that would at least stop the contamination further in my mind....I was at it for about 20-30 minutes.....and as soon as stopped I noticed my lower part of my pants where covered in splashes.......OMG IM COVERED IN DOG POO IM CONTAMINATED AGAIN!!. So again  I stripped off and off I popped into the shower for another hour or so.

The garden clean didn’t work as sometime between the garden soak and Monday morning one of the cats had walked their ultra muddy wet paws along the floor and onto the back on the couch......I was almost crying as I was convinced it was full of dog poo remnants soacked into the floor and couch and once again I just keep thinking it’s being spread everywhere through walking around the house by us and the cats.

And since then all I have done is clean the floors over and over, the couch has been scrubbed to death and the cats keep walking in and out everywhere here and there and I’m just going out of my mind.

My partner’s brain is still working correctly and is relaxed about it like any normal person, it doesn’t bother her at all as she doesn’t think any of what I think is happening.

I’ve been using antimicrobial wipes on everything over and over, on different days, my hands are wrecked from the cleaning and washing. I bought 10litres of cleaning vinegar for the garden and poured that the best I could over the areas which were contaminated (I ordered a big spray bottle but It came a day late). My partner is stressed to fuck with me as I’m cleaning so much and I’m not available to help with baby duties. My work has suffered as I can’t concentrate or I’m in the shower when I should be at my PC.

I’ve had at least 2 further meltdowns over cleaning certain things as I get confused over what has touched what and where etc....

I’ve always had a few OCD tendencies which came out in a massive a massive flare up about 12 years ago (where the squeaking of fruit packaging made a horrible squeak sound that cut right through me which turned into a sound and touching stuff problem for about 6 months, I couldn’t walk on grass, touch toilet paper, lots of,other things without getting that chalkboard scratching shudder feeling) it took me about 6 months for that to calm down.

I’ve always been a little bit OTT with hygiene related cleaning but it was always manageable before COVID-19 and having a baby so I think those have amplified my cleaning tendencies. I have been washing the delivered food shopping and quarantining post for a year now and it has become completely normalised as well as washing my hands about 4 times for everything I touch that may have coronavirus on it from outside the house.

As it stands right now I’m planning on cutting the grass in the morning, flooding the garden with a new hose and keeping the cats out all day while I clean the inside of the house as much as I can. I have 10 more litres of cleaning vinegar which I may or may not use (not decided). I feel like I am fighting a losing battle of stopping the contamination.

676,,OCD,"I remember I had a thought as a young child (I think I must of been around 7) and it was quite a horrific thought but it didn’t bother me much back then. In fact I think I continued building on that thought in my mind for a bit. I never acted on nor do I believe I ever would have. But I’m now absolutely scared to death of it. Does this make me a bad person now?! I’ve never had that thought since that age but it’s now fuelling my evidence about how I am the worst person in the entire world and that I must die. I can’t breathe I physically feel so defeated. I really cannot see how I can keep going on with my life. 

There’s a voice in my head telling me I need to let go and just fall into this person I’m so scared to be. As if that actually is the real me. I’m so scared I’m going to lose control and become this terrible person. I’m scared I will actually like it. What is this?! Is this even ocd anymore?! Please someone tell me!! I’m so scared of myself I’m just so scared to keep living I can’t do this. How do people keep going like this.

687,,OCD,"Since I was about 8 years old, I would always count everything to 4 and when I touched something accidentally 2 times, then I would have to touch it 2 more times so it adds to 4.. I know it sounds a bit crazy or weird but idk it’s just normal for me. It’s always very satisfying to me, when it’s either 4 or 16 (16 because 4x4). Idk i guess my brain is like obsessed with this number??????

I’m 16 now, and it has never been so severe, I’m not sure if it’s because lately I’ve had a lot of stress because of school and friends. Especially my grades, since I’m on the edge of repeating the year. During exams it’s very hard to focus sometimes because I’m just touching my pen the whole time counting to 4. 
It’s honestly quite exhausting because when I go hangout with my friends or have to be someplace, I also do last minute counting or have to place objects neatly there and make sure everything looks about right so that I can go, which leads to me often being late :/

(((((((( If you have something similar please share your story in the comments as it would interest me a lot!! I would love to know your experiences ))))))

Here are a few other examples of my daily counting,

- When I touch the door handle I count to 4 in my head, and I always have to press it down 4 times too (this is basically with any item but the I’m naming the most common ones)

- If I blink to fast 2 times I need to blink with the same speed 2 times again so it adds up to 16

- Before I mentioned the number 16, that is because if I accidentally touch something for than 4 times I need to count more until its 16 so that’s  its ok

- When my mom takes the car at night to go pick up my sister from a friends house, all of a sudden I am forced by myself to touch everything way more than usual because I then have this feeling if I don’t touch everything exactly the correct way mom will get into a car accident or something bad will happen

- I’m half French meaning fluent in it as well, and for some reason I always have to count in French when my “ocd” hits, its like a made up rule that has just always been there

- When I type on my laptop accidentally 2 times the same letter after another i also do it 2 more times so it adds up to 4 and the continue writing, so when I write essays it takes a lot longer

But it’s really just anything I touch, it needs to be 4 times said in my head in French. 

Anyways, there are so many of these that happen daily and I honestly I don’t know anyone else who can relate to me, they all say its so ‘weird’ and no one understands.. If someone has something similar please share your story I’m so interested to hear and to relate. If you want you can also message me privately about it that makes you feel more comfortable :) 

Thank you for listening to this and hopefully understand, please share your thoughts or stories if you have anything to say, thank you all again!

Have a good day !! :))))",t2_9zd27ern,False,,0,False,I think I might have ‘counting ocd’ (number 4),[],r/OCD,False,0,,0,,False,t3_lyiu8o,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1614998694.0,text,0,,,text,self.OCD,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I was about 8 years old, I would always count everything to 4 and when I touched something accidentally 2 times, then I would have to touch it 2 more times so it adds to 4.. I know it sounds a bit crazy or weird but idk it’s just normal for me. It’s always very satisfying to me, when it’s either 4 or 16 (16 because 4x4). Idk i guess my brain is like obsessed with this number??????&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m 16 now, and it has never been so severe, I’m not sure if it’s because lately I’ve had a lot of stress because of school and friends. Especially my grades, since I’m on the edge of repeating the year. During exams it’s very hard to focus sometimes because I’m just touching my pen the whole time counting to 4. 
It’s honestly quite exhausting because when I go hangout with my friends or have to be someplace, I also do last minute counting or have to place objects neatly there and make sure everything looks about right so that I can go, which leads to me often being late :/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(((((((( If you have something similar please share your story in the comments as it would interest me a lot!! I would love to know your experiences ))))))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few other examples of my daily counting,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I touch the door handle I count to 4 in my head, and I always have to press it down 4 times too (this is basically with any item but the I’m naming the most common ones)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I blink to fast 2 times I need to blink with the same speed 2 times again so it adds up to 16&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I mentioned the number 16, that is because if I accidentally touch something for than 4 times I need to count more until its 16 so that’s  its ok&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When my mom takes the car at night to go pick up my sister from a friends house, all of a sudden I am forced by myself to touch everything way more than usual because I then have this feeling if I don’t touch everything exactly the correct way mom will get into a car accident or something bad will happen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m half French meaning fluent in it as well, and for some reason I always have to count in French when my “ocd” hits, its like a made up rule that has just always been there&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I type on my laptop accidentally 2 times the same letter after another i also do it 2 more times so it adds up to 4 and the continue writing, so when I write essays it takes a lot longer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s really just anything I touch, it needs to be 4 times said in my head in French. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, there are so many of these that happen daily and I honestly I don’t know anyone else who can relate to me, they all say its so ‘weird’ and no one understands..

699,,OCD,"Today, as the title reads, I broke up with my girlfriend of nine months. As of typing this, two hours ago I broke up with her. She was my first actual love and person who I’ve felt connected to and genuinely cared and we broke up two hours ago.
It’s a bit surreal, all month I’ve been having my normal obsessive thoughts but they mainly focused on us splitting up. I tried my best to shut them down, reaffirm myself, and talk to her/someone about it to limit it and it worked most of the time. And then three weeks ago or so, we got into an argument. Mainly started by me. About how I felt like the relationship was extremely one-sided. It seemed to be me doing everything in my power to maintain it and fix things. And if by the chance I was bothered or upset by anything, I would bring it up to her, and she would respond with the usual, “thank you for talking to me, i’m sorry, i will try harder next time,” simple reparations that very often did not lead to solutions by her and led to me fixing her own problems. Needless to say, it had been boiling up for a month or so before this argument so although it felt good for me to release it, it was a lot for her to digest. This time, she did recognize her wrong. And she specifically said would she would do to fix it. And for once after an argument, I had a positive outlook on the relationship’s future. It looked promising. 
Today comes around like a normal day, wake up, text her I love her, continue on with the day, texting her occasionally to update her on what I’m doing or to check in. But, this past week has been dreadful. I’ve been drowning in school work, stressed by my family, and been trying to repress the most prominent and striking obsessive thoughts I’d ever had, us breaking up. This entire week it was a pain throbbing in my brain, nonstop. And every time I would tell myself to calm down, to reevaluate what I’m thinking and observing, to talk to her about them, they just got worst. Today, I told her for the second time this week that they’ve gotten worst. I’d told her specifically everything and she was supportive. She did what she could to help. It was nice. I went off to do something for school, came back two hours later, and we facetimed. It was a normal facetime, discussing our day, what we did, and how we’ve been feeling, until the idea of sex came up.
I brought up the fact that we haven’t had any romantic or sexual encounters within the past two months and whenever I would engage, I would get shot down or made fun of. It was a serious issue for me and she recognized it. I drove over to discuss it in person and as we talked, she recognized her wrong. Various different things, including wrong doings on my side and hers lead to it, but then she said those vital words, “thank you for talking to me, i’m sorry, i will try harder next time,” and something clicked for me. I decided to address it and said everything I felt. I told her how those words were just reparations and I always became the one to fix things. And things spiraled out from there. It became a whole observation of our entire relationship. Quickly, things got serious and eventually I remembered my obsessive thoughts. Suddenly, it all made sense. I brought up the idea that maybe these are just fundamental differences in what we need in a relationship. I said that we might have drifted off while maturing in what we need in a relationship. She was hesitant to recognize and acknowledge it, cause to her, it admitted defeat. It admitted we had to break up. But eventually, after talking it through, she agreed with me. After a thoughtful and meaningful discussion of reminiscing and jokes, we broke up with tears in our eyes and snots in our noses. It was nice, mutual, and what seems to be a good note, as of right now, which I hope will stay.
This story is strange because for so long, I thought my valid thoughts and emotions was my OCD acting up. I thought it was Obsessive Thoughts that were ruining my mental image of the relationship but, they turned out to be true. So many times my obsessive thoughts tend to be exaggerations, lies, or hurtful, but this time they were helpful. They were led by emotion and knowledge. And I would have continued to push off this break up from happening if I continued to devalue my emotions and thoughts.
Sure, your mental health plays a factor into your perception of your relationships and the world around you, but they are valid. Your emotions, thoughts, and your actions are all real and valid and you have no reason to hide any of them. Listen to them when you know to. Discuss with those around you them so it will be easier to tell if they’re hurtful or harmful.
This relationship was straining my livelihood. I was carrying it on my shoulders all by myself, like I’m sure so many of you have, and once, I decided to stand up to myself, and that’s because of my OCD.

700,,OCD,"This has been on my mind a lot lately, it's my most recent festering conundrum. My past is always haunting me, even when I'm fixating on something innocuous. And every time I convince myself that there couldn't possibly be someone else in the world that does/did what I did I eventually discover that I'm dead wrong, and it gives me a huge sense of relief to know I'm not alone. So I figured I'd come here because I see myself reflected in the users of this sub more than anywhere else on Reddit.

All through 1st through 4th grades I made these odd drawings where I'd cover a sheet of paper with a random swirling line, then color in the spaces the line creates. It's difficult to describe it clearly, so I made an example: https://imgur.com/a/D03FnEM. 

The only rule was to try and prevent neighboring spaces from having the same color. Outside of that, it was completely random. Color choice, picking a space, I didn't plan any of it. I just grabbed a marker, filled in a spot, rinse and repeat. 

I made hundreds of these things. Sometimes I'd make as many as 4 or 5 in a day. I've never met anyone else or heard of anyone making drawings like these.

I've never thought much about it but lately a bunch of largely unrelated events has been bringing up those old memories. I think it's because I've discovered in recent years that a lot of the early behavior I *thought* was normal or just a little weird was actually early signs and symptoms of serious mental illness. Because of that, I've been putting all my childhood quirks and habits under the microscope.

I tried looking up some childhood psychology resources, I've known for years that a child's artwork can be interpreted in a similar way to one's dreams. I just wanted to know what it means when a child draws completely pointless abstract images. After reading a bit about it, I only feel worse.

None of the guides on interpretation mentioned anything even remotely like what I used to make. OK, that could just mean it's uncommon. But then I dove into some articles that examine the purpose behind drawing. 

Psychologists used to think younger children that had little motor control drew scribble blobs simply because they enjoyed the feeling of pencil or crayon rubbing against paper, that it was a tactile practice, but they eventually realized that every time a child draws something, even just a line, they have some kind of corresponding story playing out in their head while they do it. For children, drawing is less about what ends up on the paper and more about what's going on in their mind in that moment. For a child, even something as simple as a single straight line means something. 

All children (except for those raised in situations that are so dire they don't have any writing tools) play around with both abstract and realistic art, it plays a big role in their development. In some ways, everything they draw is abstract, even when they're trying to realistically replicate an object.

But I wasn't like that. I almost never tried to draw real objects. The only time I did something like that was when a teacher instructed us to do so. Outside of that, whenever I was given the chance to draw whatever I wanted I either drew symbols (about 10% of the time; compass roses, peace signs, and ying yangs were my favorites) or the weird abstract things like what I showed you above.

But the thing that bothers me about it is there was no story in my head, there was no meaning behind it. Like I said earlier, even scribble blobs are supposed to be something, to mean something. It's common for children to start randomly drawing and figure out what it's supposed to be while it's in progress, but I never did that either. Even after I was done, I never saw anything in it. I never named them, either. 

Children also usually draw something with the intention of presenting or giving the end result to someone, like a parent, friend, or teacher. I never even showed any of my abstract art to anyone, let alone gave them to anyone. I tucked them away in my desk or dresser as soon as they were done, then eventually threw the whole stack away when it was time to clean everything out. I never felt any attachment toward them, they didn't seem like they were worth keeping. 

I'm just trying to figure out what this means and how it relates to my mental status. The more I know about how my mind works the better I become at trying to work around or with it to create a comfortable, healthy life. 

Based on what I've learned, I'm thinking they may have been a compulsion, that it was a precursor to my desire to make pointless yet complex bullet lists about the fictional worlds and characters I create during maladaptive daydreams.

701,,OCD,"Hi there! I am a third year undergraduate at University College London. I study medicine but am taking a year out to do anthropology. For my dissertation I am really interested in looking at the experiences people have had with using forums and online support groups for OCD (I have OCD myself, but am new to these), particularly during this pandemic where so much of our lives have shifted online. I am also interested in talking about previous experiences of mutual aid groups. As part of this, I am looking to interview (via zoom) adults over the age of 18, who have visited an OCD related forum (including this one), or used a support group for OCD at least once since March 2020, and identify as having symptoms of OCD. It does not matter if you have only posted once or not at all!

Due to the nature of the topic, there is a possibility that the interview could lead to recall of a distressing period of time. In the interview you will be in charge: if there is a topic of conversation that you are not fully comfortable discussing please let me know either in advance or if it comes up. I will ensure that you are made aware of the nature of the conversation and proposed questions in advance. Recordings of the interviews will be destroyed after transcription, within 3 weeks of the interview.

702,,OCD,"Vent/Question:

How the hell do I cope with living with people who don’t respect me and my mental illness. Even pre-Covid I’ve struggled with contamination based obsessions and compulsions but they’ve gotten exponentially worse. As time goes on, and people get more impatient with stay at home orders my anxiety only gets worse.

My family don’t respect my requests to keep their distance from me in the home, they go out, visit family and friends without wearing masks, it just pisses me off. Without OCD it would piss me off due to the lack of empathy and selfishness that they display when doing these things but I feel like I’m going CRAZY!!!! They gaslight me, sneak behind my back to go to non-essential social event, and I have to constantly overhear by accident or find out on Facebook that my family members haven’t been safe and have been out and about. 

Every time I start to let my guard down and my mental health and triggers seem to get manageable I find out something that my family did behind my back that makes me spiral over and over again. I don’t have the financial means to live on my own, and I’m terrified to move during a pandemic anyways. If I could have it my own way I’d live completely on my own so I’d have a bit of control over who comes into MY safe space..

What the hell do you do when the people you live with invalidate and disrespect you all the while make you feel like you’re crazy for wanting them to do there bare minimum that the government demands?

Also I got vaccinated last month because I’m a healthcare worker, but my obsessions have gotten almost worse sense then. Half of me thinks I may have a tiny bit of protection but I still am extremely cautious and only go out for work or grocery shopping, meanwhile the other half of me thinks that my vaccine was ineffective because I had no reaction to it and that I’m just as vulnerable to getting sick and possibly killing my family and patients that I work with whom are all extremely high risk. The constant fear of killing others in general have been BAD, but COVID has only made these things exponentially worse..

I know this rant is going on long and I went on a bunch of tangents but how do you cope with not even being able to feel safe in your own house or even your own room? I spend hours doing cleaning rituals every night and I’m losing sleep and I’m extremely stressed out because of all of this.

704,,OCD,"I've tried doing ERP these past few days by completely not doing any of the OCD compulsions. Specifically, I have contamination OCD and thinking OCD.

However, I get these incredibly intense anxiety for no apparent reason. Specifically, it's like I feel bad for no apparent reason. It's like the feeling I have when I did something bad or something bad happened to me. Because if this, I get suicidal ideations where Im dreaming of shooting myself in the head.

716,,OCD,"It's been nearly a year since I noticed that one of my closest friends started suffering OCD. Since lockdown he rarely leaves home, so we see him less. He stopped answering to text messages, so we can just talk to him if we ring his house-bell.

We never talk about it with him, because we can't find a way in which it's organic and not intrussive. 

I tried to talk about it with him once, we were on our own. I asked how he was doing with OCD. Maybe it was too direct, or I did something wrong, but he told me he stopped going to the psychiatrist and taking his medication because he wanted to take over this on his own, and that he thought that his condition had inproved.

That was about three months ago, and we see him less and less. 

His mom told us he doesn't want to tell you more than his son does, because she would find it disrespectful.

I would appreciate some suggestions or help for us to have the possibility to help him out with this. Should we talk with him about it? Or we should just try him to spend as much time us possible with us forcing him to leave his house?

723,,OCD,"Hello everyone, it's been 10 years today since I've developed my first mental health issue. I was 16 y.o.

At first it all started with a panic attack disorder then then into an agoraphobia then into depression and now in obsessive mind disorder. I've been in therapy with my psychiatrist The last four years, I've taken my meds (mostly xanax and antidepressants) and right now, in this very moment, I'm not taking anymore. So you can say step forward have been made. Life has been rough. I've spent my best years worrying, paranoic, thinking always the worst, fighting for a Better future. I honestly think I Will Never be the sale happy guy I was when I was 16.

My psychiatrist says I should be proud of Who I am and what I've done so far, that I've done a lot and I've changed a lot in Better during these last 4 years.

But I think I will never be satisfied until I will Be Free and I'll know that I will never be free again.

A Year ago My psychiatrist said that I know developed an obsessive disorder. Weird thing is I have my mind full obsessed but I do not suffer of compulsion. It's like my mind is always thinking 24/7 and I can't stop it in any way. Even under xanax, it just keep going, the only benefit is that most of my thoughts doesn't make me so anxious as normally does.

My obsession are of different kind, sexual, violent, sometimes depressing (i.e. I imagine to be at the funeral of people which I love and are alive), sometimes are instead focused on new hobbies which I don't really like, or things wich I could not care less or even dreaming a better future, but in an unhealthy way, making plan the obsessive way.

I don't know how to deal with this and honestly I'm tired. It's been a 10 year fighting and I just can't take it anymore. Does anyone suffered of the same problem? How did you deal with it? I have the feeling that I will always be like this and there is no escape.

Does anyone suffered of the same problem? How did you deal with it? I have the feeling that I will always be like this and there is no escape.
I feel like there is no solution anymore and even when I some the problem what do I have? I wasted my golden years being a lone weirdo. I know have a girlfriend but I&amp;#39;m not happy about myself and I watch my past life full of remorse.&lt;/p&gt;

724,,OCD,"Hi, I'm 27F and have been on 20mg Escitalopram (Lexapro) for several years now. Recently, I have felt my OCD getting a bit out of control and my doctor recommended switching to Paroxetine (Paxil). Naturally, I have become obsessive about this (it has been 4 days since the convo with my doctor and I have spent 24+ hours researching Paxil in research journals, etc). The anxiety about switching is now completely consuming my life and I literally can't focus on anything else. I have called my doctor to discuss further, but she can't fit me in until next week and I do not think I can handle feeling this way until then. So, I'm hoping to hear about others' experiences. 

&amp;#x200B;

Questions/concerns I have:

1) Does anyone have experience switching SSRIs? Did you have a better experience upping the dose of your current SSRI or switching to a new one altogether?

2) I've done a lot of research and it sounds like Lexapro is generally much preferred to Paxil. I am now having panic attacks at the thought to switching to Paxil because it sounds ""less tolerable"". Does anyone have experience switching to this (I realize everyone is different... but some positive experiences could be comforting)?

3)  We are tapering off the Lexapro over the next two weeks... I'm on the 10mg now and I literally feel out of control. I can't stop crying and am having withdrawal symptoms (chills, night sweats, bad dreams, headache, brain fog). This is making me feel like switching is not worthwhile :(

725,,OCD,"———TRIGGER WARNING: TALKS ABOUT OBSESSIVE/INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS THAT INCLUDE VIOLENCE AND SELF HARM——— 
So every night before bed, I take my medicine because it makes me very tired (fluvoxamine.) Last night, I crashed early after I got home from a long shift at work and when I woke up I realized I forgot to take my meds. I had a pretty busy day planned, so I was a little nervous but thought I’d be fine because I already went so long without being medicated. I was insanely wrong. I have obsessive and intrusive thoughts about really gruesome acts of violence happening to me, like really  really messed up things. I am obsessed with the idea that someone I love is going to kill me or torture me and they are going to do it when I am not looking, they just won’t do it because they know that I have the feeling it will happen to me. Obviously I am dead wrong and I know that, but my body feels like I am preparing to have to run and fight for my life all the time, it’s dead set on the fact someone is going to mutilate me to the point where I wish they would just kill me. 

I went on a trip to a rural small town today to go with my aunt to an appointment and to see some cool local shops, the entire time I was slowly starting to be consumed by unwanted thoughts.
-“She is going to put that cigarette out in my eye. Look away so she doesn’t have the chance.” 
-“She is going to swerve into a car on purpose and it will kill the both of us. Where are your legs, how can you protect them from breaking if so?” 
-“it would hurt if you bit off your thumb” 
-“it would hurt if someone skinned you”

Those were just some thoughts running through my head at the time. I went home and soon had to hang out with my boyfriend who I had planned on going to the gym with. We skipped today bc decided to get a healthy dinner and go for a short hike. We had many conversations but I kept really focusing on violence. We started talking about animals and immediately thought about all the things that could maul me; then he started talking about going to Kodiak, Alaska for the military and BOOM guess who is thinking about Kodiak bears and being pinned and eaten alive by a bear!! This sexy mentally ill gal right here that’s who. Here are some thoughts I had through out our time hanging out that played in repeat in my head. 
-“A bear could pin you and eat your organs while you’re still alive and you could do nothing about it.” 
-“imagine being mauled by a tiger”
-“what if someone slit your throat. It would hurt. There would be so much blood and you’d know what was happening too.” 
-“your boyfriend is going to bite your jugular out, do not let him hug you or get close to your neck.” 
-“what if I slammed my leg in the car doors until it was mangled. What if it happened to my fingers.” 
-“don’t ever use a gun. You will end up shooting your self.” 

As soon as I got home tonight I took my meds and I’m getting tired and feeling better. I think I need a higher dosage because I have horrible panic attacks induced from the stress my OCD causes, it gets to the point I can’t move or breathe properly and no one can touch me because I feel like they are going to hurt or kill me. I still have small intrusive thoughts here and there, but the anxiety often isn’t nearly as much and the feelings aren’t so overwhelming. 

I will have visions of someone taking a bite out of my skin on my forearm. I will see (all in my head ofc bc these are intrusive thoughts/visions) someone shooting or stabbing me while I’m out anywhere, even at work. I have trouble sleeping at night because I’m obsessed with the thought that someone is my household is going to kill me in my sleep. While my family isn’t perfect, they would not hurt me like that and I know it, but I don’t believe it if that makes sense. 

Anyways, does anyone else have a similar obsession or issue with that? Has anyone else stopped taking their meds on accident for a day and getting really squirmy and uncomfortable and sometimes nauseous? Also, does anyone else get a nervous twitch or tick when you get a really bad and messed up intrusive thought because often my head will snap to my shoulder or I will blink hard and excessively and shake my head. Sorry for all the questions, but I have been struggling for so long and feel like I’m going crazy and I kinda just need some kind of understanding or validation from people who understand how hard and frustrating this is. 

(Again, I am medicated and I have a a psychiatrist and a therapist as well as a family doctor to keep up with who all know about how severe my OCD is.)

Feel free to ask questions as well, I’m open to all input and experiences.",t2_92nvdsy0,False,,0,False,Forgot to take my meds last night,[],r/OCD,False,0,,0,,False,t3_ly3nq2,False,light,1.0,,public,2,1,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Support,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1614946230.0,text,0,,,text,self.OCD,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;———TRIGGER WARNING: TALKS ABOUT OBSESSIVE/INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS THAT INCLUDE VIOLENCE AND SELF HARM———

728,,OCD,"Hi there,

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm in the middle of a bit of a dilemma. It's with my current therapist. See she is what is considered an ""OCD expert"", by that I mean she's listed on the [iocdf.org](https://iocdf.org) website and is apparently the kind of therapist I should be seeing.

The thing is and I know this myself because I've done the research - we have done ZERO exposure therapy - and as you all know- that's the gold standard therapy for OCD. Truthfully, I don't even really know how she has helped me OCD wise. She often confuses me frankly.

Now the problem is she's one of the nicest/most caring therapists I have yet to encounter - I had a few difficult moments and didn't hesitate to accommodate me when necessary. 

But the thing is, ultimately the reason why I am seeing her is because she's an ""expert"" at treating OCD. And if I'm not making any progress with my OCD while seeing her, as I haven't - why should I see her?

The problem lies with insurance frankly. See another big reason why I'm seeing her she's ONE OF FOUR therapists (out of like 30) who take Medicaid, and if you don't know what that is - that's the government sponsored insurance program for people below a certain income - here in the United States, where I live.

And truly, I'm sort of in between a rock and a hard place. If I stop seeing her altogether then I risk being caught with out a therapist in general and will be forced to scrap around somehow (if possible). Truthfully, I want to stay with her, but I also want to get better.

This whole time I've been waiting for her to give me some sort of program or guideline to follow so I can finally make the progress I need to make. But she doesn't say anything about ERP. I've also out of necessity have had to resort to self-education through books on Amazon that do help administer some sort of ERP, ""Freedom From OCD"", by Dr. Jonathon Grayson being one of my favorites. 

Now like I said, I could use the help, but I suppose if I have to do exposures on my own, I might do that (which I've already started). But like I said, help would be nice.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, if you read through all that and have some advice to give - I would appreciate it.

&lt;p&gt;-The image posted is from &lt;a href=""https://www.city.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/282379/Mindfulness-Distressing-Voices-Andy-Phee.pdf""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; pdf for a mindfulness-based group for those who struggle with psychosis. Again, though this is for psychosis, the practice is for understanding and coping with distress specifically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://preview.redd.it/b3dk3v4kt3l61.png?width=961&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=32ea48c7417ca2b77bad06c8da029617e42f68c7""&gt;https://preview.redd.it/b3dk3v4kt3l61.png?width=961&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=32ea48c7417ca2b77bad06c8da029617e42f68c7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you find these helpful. If not, no worries. Take care of yourselves, and seek treatment if you are able.&lt;/p&gt;

742,,OCD,"Well now my intrusive thoughts have me scared that I may be a sociopath. I am a 27 year old woman with OCD and health anxiety. Suspected borderline personality but I don’t meet the criteria anymore (since a few years ago). 

Some background info: In childhood I went through trauma. I have always been the black sheep of my family. I was bullied relentlessly and I remember feeling depressed as early as 5 or 6. I have always had a very strong sense of embarrassment. I was very shy and didn’t have a lot of friends. I was also very sensitive. I loved my pets, and I remember their deaths being very difficult for me. I wrote a poem for my grandmother’s 20 year old cat who passed when I was 12. 

I had depression and anxiety in high school and I have been on many SSRIs, benzos, and even an antipsychotic. I’m not on anything now. I used to cut, but I haven’t in years. 

When I watch an emotional video about animals or old people, I cry. Sometimes I can’t stop. There’s a poem that goes “when tomorrow starts without me” that was attached to a video on a TikTok about a cat who had passed away and when I think about it I start to tear up because I think about my kitty who suddenly passed away when I was 21. He died in my arms of a heart attack - I heard him screaming from another room and ran out to see what was going on. It was too late by the time my mom got on the phone with the vet. Losing him was incredibly painful and I don’t think I actually recovered properly. 

Regardless of these things, a friend will tell me she’s got a stomach ache or throwing up, and I don’t think I feel anything? Like I mean, it sucks and I hope they get better, and I would do what I can to help them, but I just feel empty about it? Am I supposed to have a heart crushing feeling of sadness to experience empathy? Or is it enough that I understand that she is feeling unwell and crappy and that her day is ruined cause of it? When a friend says they got rejected, I mean I know the feeling of rejection, but I don’t feel it when they tell me they feel it. 

I have done morally reprehensible things in the distant past which I don’t want to talk about but I am working through forgiving myself for those things. I feel immense guilt/shame for those that were affected by my actions and actually lately it has even been all consuming... like why did I do those things in the first place? If I feel guilt/shame/remorse, I can’t be a sociopath. So what makes someone do hurtful things to others? Pain and suffering of one’s own? 

One more thing I wanted to add, I am in love. I have a beautiful fiancée and I’d do anything for her. She is amazing and I never want her to feel hurt or sorrow. I feel a sense of well-being when I hug her or cuddle her. I think it’s the oxytocin. I just know when I am hugging her, I feel ok. When she cries, I cry. We don’t fight or argue. I always try to be the best I can for her, I try to surprise her with treats when I can. 

But still... sometimes I feel like I don’t have empathy. Do I seem like a sociopath??? I don’t want to be. I want to grow old with my fiancée and get married to her, and have a simple life. I don’t want to think that I don’t have empathy. I WANT to have empathy but sometimes idk if I really do. I’m so fucked up over this I don’t even know how to continue with my life. I’m stuck on something bad I did a few years ago (I won’t speak of it but all parties involved are okay, that is all I wanna say). Like I said I am consumed with guilt and I have been praying that the individual I hurt has found healing and also that I will forgive myself one day and that God will forgive me.

743,,OCD,"I have ocd but I dont know if this is part of it so I dont really know where else to post this. Here's the story:

So basically a little background, my girlfriend and I have been together for 5 months already (LDR and met once last feb 27) and we've spent most of those 5 months time together. This is my first relationship and my girlfriend came from a relationship where she got cheated on. For the time that we have been together, I can clearly tell that she's already moved on from her past relationship and that she doesn't miss her ex at all anymore. In short, our relationship is going pretty well.

Recently, we had encountered and are dealing with an issue. She doesn't have that much of a close relationship with the older people in her family so her family started spreading rumors that she was seeing her ex since january this year. It came to the point where she even heard her aunt wanting to talk to my parents about it. She basically got so fed up about her family picking their nose in our relationship so we decided to be on a break for a while. (My girlfriend was the one that told me all this).

So the problem now is that I keep imagining my girlfriend and her ex seeing each other even if I know damn well that it didn't happen. This thought has been popping up in my head for the past few days now and it's the first time in my life where I'm getting so affected by a rumor to the point where I'm even imagining how it happened(or how it didnt happen). I've been dealing with intrusive thoughts for quite a while now so I don't really know if it's part of it.

At the time the issue was happening and how she was telling me all about it, I felt fine and wasn't affected by the rumor at all. I would say that I even handled the situation pretty well but as mentioned, a few days later, the rumor kept affecting me.

I've been telling myself that it isn't real, it didn't happen and that it's just a rumor. I've even tried accepting it and mocking the thought but it somehow just keeps coming to me and I'm so tired of it.

I really want to know if anyone else experienced/is experiencing something like this, if it's part of intrusive thoughts and how to deal with it.


Note: Idk if this is relevant to the situation but I've always hated her ex after what he's done.

Another note: My girlfriend is really loyal based on a lot of evidence and experience so the rumor didn't happen

Another another note: I've been dealing with my intrusive thoughts through self ERP and it's actually working pretty well. For example, I would get thoughts that I would cheat on my girlfriend and I might lose control. So I would challenge myself to try to flirt or message other girls and it would make me more anxious. Because of this I get less of the thought and it doesnt affect me that much anymore.

I’ve dealt with hair pulling since I was about 5. I think I do it most when I’m incredibly stressed (when I was a kid it was moving and being kind of lonely, now it’s quarantine and school and intrusive thoughts stressing me out).

754,,OCD,"Don't even really know why I'm writing this. I'm 21 years old, in community college, living at home, and my mental health spiraling downwards exponentially. For the past 5 years I've dealt with depression and anxiety and thrown my life entirely off track. I dropped out of high school to ""do online school"", quit that, got a GED and sat on my ass for years in my parents house smoking weed and playing games all day. Honestly looking back I thought it couldn't get any worse than how I felt then. Boy was I wrong...

I think going back at least 2 years ago I can identify OCD like tendencies forming, really just little things, making sure my door was locked an extra time, double checking the fridge was closed, making sure my car windows were up etc. Thought it was just anxiety, but slowly I began to realize that these once somewhat benign thoughts turned into much more aggressive intrusive thoughts. Those simple ""rituals"" turned in serious time sinks. Going up and down the stairs to make sure the door was locked over and over, back and forth to the car to check the windows/doors, and closing the fridge door repeatedly until it felt right or until I was seriously so mad I just forgot about it.

I already thought that was bad enough, but when covid started, it went downhill fast... Before I could even realize I was fully engulfed by contamination OCD. I was constantly analyzing every single thing I touch, not eating with my hands, reheating food, and of course, washing my hands an insane amount. It got to the point where my hands were incredibly dry and cracked it actually hurt physically just as much as mentally.

This was just the beginning. I already had health anxiety and have spent thousands on finding out if small symptoms were going to kill me. From one thing to the next, colon cancer, melanoma, nasal cancer, HIV, getting a girl pregnant, stis, and god knows what else. Time and time again I'd through tests and wait to see the results. Just to find out nothing is wrong, and within days or weeks I am on a new thing to obsess about. 

The most recent is where I really realized this is not sustainable long term. My house has mice in it and honestly never thought much of it, kind gross but was w/e. I went to fix something with my cars ventilation system and found a mouse nest. Carelessly cleaned it up and then after realized that was not smart. Started reading about hantavirus, the plague, infections etc. etc. I went into full blown panic researching everything, calculating my chance of infection, chance of death, on and on. This was already bad enough

Of course after this, just to add the cherry on top I was sitting in my room (researching that bs) and a mouse jumped on me and bit or scratched me on the hand. I legit lost it, I actually didn't know what to do, I stood in my bathroom for hours with my hands out in a full blown panic just not knowing what to do. Could have been easily 4+ hours of doing this, absolutely lost on what I should possibly do. Eventually passed out of the toilet and awoke to still be in the nightmare, thoughts of rabies, the plague, hantavirus, etc. etc. Went to the hospital and did the whole nine. Rabies shots, antibiotics, ""wound care"". Cost an arm and a leg. Really the rabies obsession is still fizzling a bit but at least I can mentally fall back on the vaccine. 

I don't know what to do anymore, I'm broke as a joke, have to leave my parents soon, still in full blown contamination OCD, with the new obsession being HIV ofc... I don't know how possibly I can get a job and function like this. Maybe I deserve all of this, idk... I messed up my life with addiction and spiraled down since.

What really makes me so hopeless, is when I am finally free of my current obsession (whether its a day or a couple weeks, MAYBE a month if I'm lucky). I am in increasingly worse bouts of depression. Where honestly I really wouldn't care what happens to me.

Before this all started I really was the happiest and most outgoing kid that was just happy to be here on earth. Through my own poor decisions and I guess genetic predisposition to mental illness, my life has fallen apart and I see no end in sight.

I'm honestly just so over this... I have done so much to try to make myself better: therapy, diet, exercise, getting into college, getting a job, meeting new people, trying to do fun activities, and putting myself out there. And everything just gets worse...

It was one thing dealing with anxiety and depression on their own (not trying to downplay them), but adding OCD makes it really seem impossible to ever be able to function normally.

I could go on and on about different obsessions and compulsions but honestly just thinking about them stresses me out as some of them are so insane it honestly makes me cringe.

I really wish I'd just wake up one day and this nightmare would be over. Or maybe just not wake up at all. I really wouldn't be too opposed to that. To be honest I don't want to die by any means, I would love to be happy, and well... sane, but it honestly just doesn't seem realistic anymore. Regardless, I'm still fighting this fight... Just seems to be a never ending war...

757,,OCD,"PLEASE READ IT ALL. I really need help
Alright so I am going to do something very uncomfortable to me but I just discovered this thread and it's been helpful.
Before I start. I am a STRAIGHT male always have been BUT i struggle with sexual ocd and many other OCDs but for the sake of this post I will talk about sexuality ocd. I don't wanna hear ""oh its ok if you question yourself or feel attracted or think that you are..."" because I am straight and I have heard that plenty of times and it certainly doesn't help someone with OCD. Anyways here it officially goes...
All my life I have been a straight male and never ever struggled with any sexuality stuff. My first crush was a girl in kinder. I was a jock in hs basically so typical sporty guy. I started watching porn at 13 and never struggled with sexuality. Again I have always been straight and I know I am. However, three years ago I started suffering from severe sexuality ocd. At the time I didn't know this was ocd because although i've struggled with ocd all my life, it never escalated to that severity. I have my life planned out, would tear up thinking of an amazing life with kids and a wife that I can care for. Then thes thoughts hit me. It was a phone call with my ex and she started talking bout some gay guy at her job and LITERALLY out of no where my brain spoke to me ""what if you're gay."" And that made me very surprised that my mind even thought that. Hell I cringe in seeing two guys because I am straight. And i kept obsessing on it severely because I wanted to know ""WHY THE HELL DID I THINK THAT, WHY IS MY BRAIN TELLING ME THAT"" and it went on and on for about a year. I got depressed because I wanted to date a giel but the thoughts were severely taking a toll on my life. I ""lost attraction"" to females for a while when my ocd was extremely high. My mind tricked me into thinking i was maybe attracted to dudes which man just typing this makes me feel f****g weird. Doesn't sound like me, i cringe hard. Anyhow, i stopped obsessing over it FINALLY after counseling and my attraction to females came back again like normal and my thoughts never completely left but they sometimes come haunt me in different severities. I started obsessing to 'prove' my sexuality with women and i read a post here that it does harm to prove it. And it did. Now, I would like to live my life how i desire it and planned all my life. Will these sexuality thoughts ever leave? I get disturbed by them. I know I am straight, no doubt in my mind. But these thoughts come and go and sometimes hit hard and it messes with my confidence. At one point they made me feel like a weak, feminine dude which I am not and never was and it just made me avoid my bros and guys in general. I am a sports junkie and gym freak and feel like a weak feminine dude inferior to men because of my stupid dumbass ocd. It really did destroy my life. It changed who i am. I want my self again. I miss my normal self. The thoughts don't have the same power as they did, but i wish i never had them. It changed me. Makes me feel like a weak man. Makes me actually question my sexuality even though I always come to the same damn conclusion, that I am straight as I was always. At one point I considered doing so many things and oh God, thankfully I never did because I realize now my ocd was playing mind games and I would have been depressed. Reminds me of my uncle who waa curious and had sex with a dude and regrets it with all his life and it makes him feel like absolute crap cus hes straight. I've always encountered gay guys like school, work, etc, etc and it was never ever an issue. I avoided them for so long because my ocd would flare  up. I wanna be able to interact with everyone again like I used to and not have my mind play games on me. I avoided fellow men because I felt inferior or my mind would tell me 'what if u are attracted to them'. I don't like hanging out with females like friends because what the hell man all they do is girl stuff and I like doing man stuff. I had a vision for my life and still do. But ocd really screwed my thinking patterns. I want that amazing romantic relationship with a girl again that made me feel incredible. I don't wanna have to do it for the sake of proving my sexuality. I still struggle with those thoughts on ocassions, and I wish they were nevee here because when I get them i try to combat them but that never works, your mind is fixated on that thought. What can I do? How can I make this better? Will ocd thoughts (regardless of the topic) ever leave? Are they here to stay but all we can do is ignore it? Because once ur mind opens up a vessel to thoughts, well, they'll always be around. Advice is needed please.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I was 12 I have looked at cartoon porn, I always looked at it and enjoyed it. The only time that I have ever come across very fucked up age related cartoon porn was when I was 12 and came across the first and only loli image I have ever seen. Im still scared today (if my ability to remember something 6 years ago shows anything).

I had since I was young as a teenager had a naive approach to most online cartoon porn, in that if it was avaliable (e.g. on websites such as pornhub, xvideos or rule34 that it was okay, since these websites were so huge and easy to access). I only began to realise how wrong I was until 2 months ago. This is where it all started.

I was watching a film and had this sudden worry that this little girl in the film was ""attractive"", not in the sense of I would want to do anything, but cute like a dog or cat. However my brain clocked this in as a genuine sign of ""arousal"" and so I fell down th ocd hole.

I began the standard vetting process of my past, concluding that I couldent take any evidence from before I was eighteen, that worked as reassurance for a while due to my belief that any character I had masturbated to was around my age at the time (generally if they were 16, that was okay in my mind since 16 is age of consent in the UK and I am only 18 myself). It took a turn however when I realised characters from the show avatar (specifically the fire nation characters) were much younger than I thought they were. In addition a pokemon character who I thought was 17 turned out to be 12 (rosa if you google the characters name).

I had originally thought this since on the web these characters seem to be so sexualised that I assumed they ""had"" to be 16-17, especially rosa since one of the top results on google images is some weird sexual shit. This bugged me for the last 2 months but something recently pushed me over the breaking point.

I was going on with my day when I got the sudden urge to jack off to something I jacked off to years ago. Effectively this image  was a character from the game league, specifically the yordle character poppy, yordles if you dont know what they are, are small furry creatures who are like 2-3 ft tall, so already i know this sounds fucked. But, this image had this character with large breasts and I remember first seeing it when I was 14. I jacked off to this image, but now a few days later I find myself typing this right now. 

I actually feel like that incriminates me, that what I just typed means something, as this character was really small and I realised that other images of these characters (despite not being human) clearly play upon the fact they are ""small"".

I cant help but feel like I am some sort of genuine monster because after jacking off to that I immediately felt regret, disgust, self-hatred and doubt in myself that this is just ""ocd"". I get (what I believe) are gronial responses over characters I jacked off to when I was a kid, believing that I am still attracted to them today.

The thing is, I debate whether I would have even jacked off to that image of a yordle (if I wasnt having pocd) I am almost certain that I would not have and simply have forgotten it.

I know this post is effectively a giant reassurance check but I just dont know how to move on,  I never saw these small furry yordle creatures as anything in the slightest bit pedophillic since its so far from a child and the image i looked at, they had giant breasts. Yet, I still feel disgusting.

Just wanted to spill my story somewhere in full, since I dont know how long I can deal with this. The anxiety and guilt has hit a point where I cant find any enjoyment in life. I'd like to end the post by stating that I have only ever had this problem with CARTOON PORN and never anything real. I dont know if that absolves me of anything however.

761,,OCD,"Hi, I'm a 19 y/o male I'm struggling with Sexual Orientation OCD and I'm almost certain I'm bi, this is my first post on here so not really sure how to structure this but here goes, its a long one. (**TL;DR** at the end of the post, it might help to read the **bottom line** too)

**\*\*\*\*\*\*TRIGGER WARNING\*\*\*\*\*\***

&amp;#x200B;

**How it started, My symptoms and everything up until I found out about HOCD:**

For just under a year now I've been having what I think are intrusive thoughts about my sexuality, mainly that I might be bisexual. For my whole life I've only been interested in girls but I know its possible that I had unconsciously repressed any desire I have for men. I also have a lot of gay and bi friends so I wouldn't expect to have much homophobia if any so the discomfort and stress this caused me was quite confusing.

It feels like these thoughts originally didn't bother me and I felt secure in my sexuality, but at some point I found myself spending hours a day trying to prove and figure out if I am bisexual or not. This became very overwhelming and took up so much of my day that I would do anything to get a break from thinking about it but I could only get a few moments of relief.

One way I would try to figure out whether I was or not was to compare my attraction to men and women on social media, at first there seemed to be a clearly different feeling when looking at women which I would attribute to me being attracted to them and conclude that I'm straight but the more I thought about it and tried to envisage myself being with men the more confused I got and it was much harder to tell whether I am actually attracted to men. 

I started to become so hyperaware of my thoughts that I found myself having thoughts like ""you think they're good looking"" or ""they're hot"" before I had even seen the image of the person (e.g scrolling through instagram and feeling the butterflies/arousal feeling before I'd actually scrolled enough for the person to be in the image), I also had this once when I looked at handwriting and a few other non-sexual objects. It was at this point I realised there may be something else at play and that this was not normal sexual attraction I was used to.

Despite this realisation, I still couldn't shake the questioning and it came to a point where I felt that the only way I would be able to stop questioning myself was to accept that I was bi. I did just this and I felt a level of relief however this was exteremly short lived.

I woke up expecting all the questioning to stop but it went nowhere, I spent hours on forums reading about people's experience discovering they were bisexual and seeing if I could relate to it, lots of people reported having crushes on the same sex when they were younger and this was something I never experienced.

I read that the discomfort and lack of desire to be with men I was experiencing was likely internalised homophobia and that I should be around people who celebrate bisexuality and are allies of the LGBT+ community, I also read that leaning into my ""bisexual side"" would help me become comfortable with myself.

I was relatively confused by this advice as to my knowledge I was already surrounded by a group of people who celebrate their sexuality and consider themselves to be LGBT+. I always found that the thoughts I had were uncomfortable and while they weren't disgusting they just didn't sit well with me and I didn't wish to carry out any form of sexual or romantic relations with the same sex.

I tried to follow this advice and when I saw attractive men I tried to mentally image myself being with them sexually, this would make me very uncomfortable but I assumed this was a product of my internalised homophobia. I would always have to back out of these thoughts just cause of how much distress they caused however I could sometimes feel a level of physical arousal which almost cemented the fact that I was bi even if I didn't mentally enjoy the thought.

I thought this was all part of the acceptance process and somewhere in this period I started to feel a burning sensation/weird itch feeling in my anus that I would have almost the whole day, I came to the conclusion that this was an urge to engage in anal play and I had to finger myself to get rid of it. I was very discomforted by this sensation so I tried to just ignore it but it wouldn't go away even after days so I fingered my anus in the hope that it would go away. It seemed that the feeling subsided for an hour maybe, but then it was back, and then I was left with the thought that I may have actually enjoyed the anal play because I had a underlying desire to have anal sex with men.

This event caused a lot of distress by itself as I found that being in any position which could be seen as sexual (e.g sitting down, squatting, laying in weird positions) or anything that could bring attention to my anus gave me images of myself being penetrated or images of fingering myself which were very mentally distressing and made me avoid such things.

To make things worse, these images would sometimes come with a level of physical arousal (erections, tingles etc.) which to me would mean that I certainly want to be in these situations. This confused me so much and made me feel like (for lack of a better word) I was being *raped* by my mind. (I do not mean to be insensitive to people who have actually experienced such abuse and I know that such a mental image is quite simply uncomparable to rape, but I think the word encapsulates purely the fact that the sexual images were unwanted and caused horrible distress regardless of the physical state of my body)

I was sent into a horrible state of low mood and anxiety and most days I would just stay in bed and sleep for hours on end since it seemed to be my only escape and thoughts of suicide were pretty common. I lost a lot of enjoyment for the things I would normally love and every little task felt like an enormous hurdle.

&amp;#x200B;

**When I realised I may have OCD:**

I read a lot about people realising they're bisexual and I began to think to myself that it was quite unlikely for someone who is actually bisexual to be this distressed by the thought of doing things with the opposite sex. I did some research and I found out about HOCD/SO-OCD. I found that almost all the symptoms I had could be caused by OCD however I was sceptical since all my thoughts were related to sexual orientation and nothing else. Although this only provided temporary relief it was comforting that there was something responsible for the distress I was experiencing.

I have been diagnosed with OCD and I am currently going through ERP therapy which was going well and up until now I've felt like I had more control over my reaction to the thoughts, they also seemed to occur less and cause me less distress.

Yesterday I spent a lot of time researching the spectrum of asexuality and I was quite interested to read about the different types of attraction (aesthetic, romantic and sexual attraction) and I have a feeling I am somewhere on the spectrum based on my past experiences. However I think this excessive research and rumination about this may have kicked my OCD back into a more uncontrollable state and I feel much more compelled to know exactly where I am on the spectrum of sexuality.

**My problem (where I need help):**

I am in my second week of doing exposure therapy and one of my exposures is to put myself in the ""sexual"" positions I feared (e.g standing and sitting), so I repeatedly stand and sit on my chair and my mind will give me images of squatting on a penis and usually I would distract myself from that thought but since it's an exposure I try to stay in the thought. I find this very uncomfortable but I know it will help me in the long run.

The issue is, almost 100% of the time I do this I get a rock hard erection, and I have tried to associate no meaning to it, but it feels like this must certainly mean I enjoy the thought. When I went to do the exposure today my body had a similar response to when I get ready to masturbate which I was shocked and distressed by.

\*\*\*\*\*\*WARNING (GRAPHIC)\*\*\*\*\*\*

I had a thought that the only way I could know if I'm actually enjoying the thoughts is to masturbate to gay porn and see if I like it. When looking at it I was very uncomfortable but I remembered that this was a good way to see if it's really what I want. I found that my penis went limp a lot and it felt harder to get myself going than when I watch straight porn and most of it was disgusting but I did feel  aroused. I went back to straight porn after a bit of browsing because I didn't feel as good as I usually do watching straight porn but then I kept asking myself if it was only because I hadn't found the right video yet. So I went back to the gay porn and there was one feminine man who I found good looking so I masturbated to the video and I orgasmed. I felt sick afterwards, and many times through the video I thought to myself that I don't want to orgasm while watching the video but I told myself I *should* do it so I can be comfortable that I could be bi. 

**Bottom Line:**

I can say after this that I probably am somewhat bisexual and I doubt that I actually have OCD a lot, but I still feel just as uncomfortable thinking about any form of gay sex as I did before and it does not feel ""desirable"" to me. I just want to be with girls as thats what I know and feel good about but I cant help but feel like my feelings of discomfort are caused by some denial/repression of my sexuality or internalised homophobia which feels so wrong and discourages me from ignoring the thoughts. I really don't know how to deal with this as I feel the need to know if im bi so much that I am missing out on my classes and not doing any of my coursework as all my time is spent trying to figure this out.

**TL;DR:**

I was diagnosed with OCD and started ERP therapy for SO-OCD and it seemed to be going well but in one of my exposures which triggers images about gay sex, I experience what seems like sexual arousal (I get erections so similar to regular arousal it feels wrong to call it a groinal response) but I feel uncomfortable and feel like I do not desire the content of the mental images. I stupidly thought that the only way I could tell if I was bi would be to masturbate to gay porn. I fought through a lot of thoughts that I don't want to continue watching while I orgasmed but I ignored them as I believed that finishing the act would help me become comfortable with the fact I could be bi. This obviously didnt make me any more comfortable with being bi or with the gay thoughts but I think for sure I am at least somewhat bisexual, however I still feel the need to know exactly how bisexual I am. I feel like the problem has got out of hand again and I am missing important aspects of life (university, social life) in favour of researching and trying to figure out my sexuality.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd love to hear the experience of people dealing with SO-OCD, OCD in general or if u are bisexual yourself and if you guys have any advice I'd really appreciate it, also I'm finding this very hard to deal with as u can probably tell so if anyone would like to pm or something that would be pretty helpful.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;******TRIGGER WARNING*****\&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How it started, My symptoms and everything up until I found out about HOCD:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For just under a year now I&amp;#39;ve been having what I think are intrusive thoughts about my sexuality, mainly that I might be bisexual. For my whole life I&amp;#39;ve only been interested in girls but I know its possible that I had unconsciously repressed any desire I have for men. I also have a lot of gay and bi friends so I wouldn&amp;#39;t expect to have much homophobia if any so the discomfort and stress this caused me was quite confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels like these thoughts originally didn&amp;#39;t bother me and I felt secure in my sexuality, but at some point I found myself spending hours a day trying to prove and figure out if I am bisexual or not. This became very overwhelming and took up so much of my day that I would do anything to get a break from thinking about it but I could only get a few moments of relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way I would try to figure out whether I was or not was to compare my attraction to men and women on social media, at first there seemed to be a clearly different feeling when looking at women which I would attribute to me being attracted to them and conclude that I&amp;#39;m straight but the more I thought about it and tried to envisage myself being with men the more confused I got and it was much harder to tell whether I am actually attracted to men. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to become so hyperaware of my thoughts that I found myself having thoughts like &amp;quot;you think they&amp;#39;re good looking&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;they&amp;#39;re hot&amp;quot; before I had even seen the image of the person (e.g scrolling through instagram and feeling the butterflies/arousal feeling before I&amp;#39;d actually scrolled enough for the person to be in the image), I also had this once when I looked at handwriting and a few other non-sexual objects. It was at this point I realised there may be something else at play and that this was not normal sexual attraction I was used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this realisation, I still couldn&amp;#39;t shake the questioning and it came to a point where I felt that the only way I would be able to stop questioning myself was to accept that I was bi. I did just this and I felt a level of relief however this was exteremly short lived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up expecting all the questioning to stop but it went nowhere, I spent hours on forums reading about people&amp;#39;s experience discovering they were bisexual and seeing if I could relate to it, lots of people reported having crushes on the same sex when they were younger and this was something I never experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read that the discomfort and lack of desire to be with men I was experiencing was likely internalised homophobia and that I should be around people who celebrate bisexuality and are allies of the LGBT+ community, I also read that leaning into my &amp;quot;bisexual side&amp;quot; would help me become comfortable with myself.&lt;/p&gt;

772,,OCD,"TL;WR: I teach myself illnesses with the true belief I have them, and I don’t even know who I am anymore besides a walking hoax, so I’ve become very suicidal and I NEED to know I;m not the only one with this type of hypochondria.

So, I’ve been diagnosed with OCD forever now, and I have hypochondria with it. However, I don’t have the average hypochondria of being scared of having an illness, I’m scared that I DON’T have the illness. Anytime I do end up “having” the illness, it feels just like a coincidence.

I guess it’s all rooted in my koinophobia- the fear of being normal. It’s weird that I have this, because I was bullied as a kid, but maybe that’s my coping mechanism? “I’ll show them” kind of attitude?

Anyway, I come out of great desperation and thoughts of suicide (good thing I’m too much of a coward to kill myself.) I hate this hypochondria. I KNOW it’s all in my head, and there are LEGITIMATE people suffering while I whine about something I’ve given myself for sh%ts and giggles,

^^^And I don’t even know who I am anymore.^^^

When I was about 8-10, my brother was undergoing cancer treatments. I was jealous of all of the attention, so I prayed to my god that I could get an illness that “Wouldn’t kill me, just make me really really sick.” I ended up with mononucleosis for 8 months (weight loss, migraines, all that jazz) that doctors could never diagnose. Regardless of whether or not this was just a coincidence (it always feels like a coincidence, I can never tell!) I am so ashamed. All of that time, money, and energy WASTED on me, when my brother needed it most. Thankfully he is healthy again, but here I am, throwing my own pity party and inviting new guests each week.

Today, I found out that my sibling has anxious tics. Well, I had been having facial tics for a few months (which have probably just been picked up because I thought they were cute) ands now they’re much more painful, I actually shout things, etc. I CAN control them to an extent, and when i forget about them they go away, but any time I think about them they get moderately severe again.

Because I don’t know who I am, I’m EXTREMELY suicidal and having terrible intrusive thoughts (every wall I look at, I imagine myself banging my head against it, all over, and the walls are just covered in large patches of blood everywhere I look). I’m having frequent manic and depressive episodes. I get nothing done. I would pull a stunt to get checked into a mental hospital, but I’d on’t think they could treat anything but my depression, which I have medicine for, anyway :(

777,,OCD,"*warning talking about obsessions related to driving*

So I’ve been diagnosed for almost two years now, but I can pinpoint my first obsessions and compulsions to *years* ago, like 2015 or 2016. The majority of my obsessions and intrusive thoughts involve driving on the interstate and over 95% of bridges, especially if they’re tall and/or long. 

Up until this year, I had been avoiding driving on them at all costs. Whether that’s going the long way to places, having someone else drive me when I needed them to, or not going to places all together. And I’d gotten good at it, to the point that when my psychiatrist would ask about driving I would brush it off or say I was too busy, because just the thought of going on the interstate brought me so much fear and I was getting by without doing that! *Until now.* I matched a guy online who lives an hour away from me and the quickest way to get to each other is via this *huge* bridge(The skyway if you’re from Florida and know it) that even people without OCD are made anxious by.  So right away I told him about my OCD and the next day he told me that it was almost a dealbreaker, but he had stuff in common so he still wanted to meet me. And this stressed me out, because for years now I do feel like a burden to my friends and family and I’ve felt very undeserving of love because of my OCD. Part of this is why I normally DONT date people out of my town, except my town’s election for my tastes is meh. And he was so cute and nice, I really wanted to meet him too. And we really hit it off, which sparked this sudden motivation to try. Because he is making 2 hour round trips twice a weekend just to take me to his place. I cannot let him do that forever, I cannot ask that if him forever. My goal is to be able to get to his place and back on my own. So I made goals and told myself I had to do them before the year is over. El oh el I’m using NOCD right now and it’s only a 9 week program, so I’m waaaaay ahead of schedule.

And I was wondering to myself “Are people going to think I’m just doing this for a guy and not myself? Am I doing this for myself?” But the more I’m doing ERP the more proud of myself I become and the more I realize how much my OCD had truly taken over my life. I’m back on the interstate now and able to take more bridges now, which means I’m getting places quicker, able to go to more places, and relying less on others. Even if things don’t work out with him, I’m going to continue my ERP. I know I can’t cure my OCD, but I can get control of it and take my life back.

Okay so a few weeks ago I started getting a weird feeling down there when someone talked about scary or violent stuff and I thought I was slowly turning into a psychopath. I couldn't stop thinking about it. I felt so disgusted with myself.
One day I was sitting next to my sister while she was watching TV. I felt worried about my groinal responses so I decided to go to the bathroom and lock the door because I had no idea how to explain my problem to my sister without sounding crazy. Instantly, after I locked the door, I started crying like crazy. My heartbeat had probably never been that fast and I felt like I was gonna throw up. My face felt so puffy and it looked so red. I thought I had finished crying, so I went to sit next to my sister. I couldn't keep it inside me anymore so I asked her if I could talk about something and she said yes. I told her about the weird arousal feelings I've gotten down there and again, I started crying because I don't wanna be a psychopath. My sister got super mad because she had told me it's just my thoughts messing with me but when I asked about the groinal responses,  she didn't really have an answer to it.
Of course my parents had to come back home right at that time and they saw me crying. I had no idea how to explain them how I get arousal feelings from violent words when I hear them or read them even though I hate them, but I somehow managed to word it and my mom said it's just my hormones because I'm a teenager. I was shaking the entire time, I was still slightly shaking after a day or two.
I need reassurance that I'm not a sadistic psychopath. I don't want to hurt anyone. I really don't. If I'm being honest, before I did research about groinal responses, I was thinking of how I shouldn't live if I feel arousal by those kinds of stuff.

787,,OCD,"Hello. I Was hoping maybe someone else who had similar fears could talk with me. The last 2 months have been hell for me in regards to my apartment. I live in an older, slightly deteriorating lower level of a house with my partner, son, and pets. Been here for 3.5 years now. Recently it’s been drawn to my attention that there is potential asbestos in numerous places throughout the home. On an enclosed porch in the form of shingles, that is used as a main entry way/ mud room. In my kitchen on the ceiling and one wall. In the bathroom, on 2 of the walls surrounding the toilet. In a pantry area that has no door, and is mainly used as cat box storage area and pet food storage area. The reason for my dismay is the fact that the one shingle on the porch has been damaged slightly from our door knob being slammed into it often over the past few years. I am also concerned because some of the ceiling in the kitchen has flaked off onto dishes and snacks and before knowing it could be asbestos, we would just wipe it away, or pick off and then go about our day. The bathroom is also a major concern, because we all spend a lot of time in there and that’s the room with water damage and the most risk of harm, in my opinion. The walls weren’t sealed to the door jamb properly, and there were a few holes nailed into suspected walls. There have also been walls nailed in every room in the house, even prior to use living here. I keep trying to rationalize that even with small damage, unless there are copious amounts of dust everywhere the risk is probably minimal. My partner painted over the shingle on the porch and then duct taped it so it can’t be damaged again. They also put caulking up in the bathroom over suspicious areas for my peace of mind (plus it looked really bad anyway). I just can’t shake the idea of what damage we have done to ourselves, and the idea of what if there are still fibers in the air or on our things slowly killing us. I keep googling and looking for more and more info or reassurance, and then I go looking for more potential asbestos products in the place. I’m scared to stay here another year or so as I’m trying to save up for a townhome of my own, but I don’t want to move into another apartment out of fear either, as moving will most likely cost me more money now and make it harder for me to get my townhome. I just need to vent to someone who understands. My partner, friends, and therapist don’t understand my ocd so that makes it hard to talk about.

Namely, it is so that my OCD appears as the omniscient, as if I have obtained some sort of superior responsibility and insight through OCD. And that if I choose not to do anything with it. I will be punished for this forever (even after my death). (I am not religious by the way).

Until today I was often still able to deal with this, because I thought at those moments; *I just go against it and if I have to pay for this after this life then so be it, but if my wife and children have a 'normal' father and husband in their life because of that, then I want to sacrifice myself for that.*

However, now I have received a certain 'message' from the all knowing' fthat if I do not fulfill my 'obligations' which I am given in form of my superior responsibility and insights, that not only will I have to atone for it forever, but also my children, and that I pass this on to my children. So it will punish my children as much as it will me, because it started to notice i was ok with beding punisched myself.

This has meant that I can no longer hide behind the thought*; I do sacrifice myself for my children.*

What should I do now? I would like to think that these are all deception and false tricks from the ocd. But it really feels like THE truth in my case.

And so when I go against that, I constantly have the feeling that I am forever condemning my children to suffering, pain and damnation.

819,,OCD,"So it’s 5AM here and I don’t want to type for hours on end when I haven’t slept in more than 17 hours so some parts will be direct copy and paste from another post I made. This is also my first time here and I understand that OCD is highly misrepresented and misunderstood so please tell me if I have misrepresented or misunderstood anything 

So my social anxiety is a little less well known in that it always feels like the complete opposite of it. Basically I'm able to spark a conversation with strangers without anxiety, to the point where I feel like there's nothing to lose and in some cases where there's a spark, I feel like I can be myself. But the moment they start being a consistent person in my life is when I start freaking out. The anxiety use to be a bit more subtle than this but  I'm basically just feeling chronic stress from just having people who aren't my family recognize who I am. 

I’m getting better at it though. It helps to have a group that recognizes who you are but isn’t having a full blown conversation with you, so they’re more just distant acquaintances really. The insomnia also helps me just forget that I have social anxiety in the first place so it’s weirdly getting better the less I sleep. However, it still frightens me when I do get closer to people, even when I actually want to cause they seem fun to hang out with, and I’m typically really cautious about making new friends because I know if they won’t abandon me then I probably will so there’s no point in starting a friendship with strings attached. Basically when I do make a potential friend, I’m reminded of how much overwhelming effort went into my old social life (I’ll get to that in a sec) and then I freak out history is going to repeat itself and I end up forcing myself to be awkward when I’m really not. There’s also the fact that I pushed away everyone who was close to me, and apparently they still remember me and try to check up on me even though I can’t bring myself to respond back to them so that’s nice. 

But what use to happen was I would get anxious of them abandoning me and leaving me alone, so I would always try to be a perfect friend. Respond on time, or else they'll slowly stop talking to you and leave. Say the right thing, or else they'll think you're boring and leave. Be the best therapist you can be for them, or else they'll think you're a bad friend and leave. Can't be the absolute best friend they could have? Start thinking about them, every second you're awake, every ounce of energy goes to making sure you won't be alone. I felt like a puppet and anxiety was pulling the strings, and yet somehow I couldn't see it was anxiety (?). Like I never had panic attacks or physical symptoms or racing thoughts. It was often masked as me improving myself, cause I use to be really shy and keep to myself, so a lot of the time I felt really alone and wondered why no one talked to me. To be honest, looking back I really felt like I was trying to be someone else, and the fact it actually worked and kept my friends when my original personality didn't reinforced the idea I had to do even better than before, and started trying to ""one-up"" myself. My obsession with being the ideal friend was I guess my way of taking control of the fact I was just really alone. It's one of the things I looked back on and wish I had tried improving my confidence instead of my social skills.

Eventually I couldn't keep up and got burnout, and started getting numb. It suddenly got increasingly harder and harder to keep up and one by one, I sort of pushed all my friends away. I still consider them my friends, cause I swear they're such good friends they forgive me every time I disappear, but I kind of wish they had better ones that weren't me. If I wasn't completely numb at the time I would have felt so much shame and guilt, cause I really broke their hearts by being the perfect friend they could wish for only to abandon them cause she got stupidly numb and demotivated out of nowhere.

Luckily I managed to get my emotional range back just last month! I don't know what happened to cause this, if it was time or me moving out of my bedroom for once or me finally doing my homework, but what matters is my numbness is slowly but surely getting better and better. Trying to keep being productive because I think that’s what opened the emotions but insomnia makes it a little hard.

I got suggested a chart about OCD today and was able to see my experiences with social anxiety in the definitions. Like I was so obsessive it honestly felt like I was being puppeted to be an ideal friend, but the anxiety really didn’t feel like anxiety because I never constantly felt panicky but rather like I was controlled and manipulated by my own insecurities and those insecurities just grew the more control I gave it. Actually the only other time that happened was my eating disorder, where I was basically living an illusion of control even when I knew it wasn’t real. I’m wondering if this experience was OCD or presented OCD-like traits (everything’s on a spectrum) or just regular social anxiety. I can’t diagnose myself but I really want to understand myself more and I guess this is a good place to start",t2_4gikts2f,False,,0,False,Social anxiety or OCD?,[],r/OCD,False,0,,0,,False,t3_lxknua,False,light,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Question,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1614893850.0,text,0,,,text,self.OCD,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it’s 5AM here and I don’t want to type for hours on end when I haven’t slept in more than 17 hours so some parts will be direct copy and paste from another post I made.

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I couldn&amp;#39;t keep up and got burnout, and started getting numb. It suddenly got increasingly harder and harder to keep up and one by one, I sort of pushed all my friends away. I still consider them my friends, cause I swear they&amp;#39;re such good friends they forgive me every time I disappear, but I kind of wish they had better ones that weren&amp;#39;t me. If I wasn&amp;#39;t completely numb at the time I would have felt so much shame and guilt, cause I really broke their hearts by being the perfect friend they could wish for only to abandon them cause she got stupidly numb and demotivated out of nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily I managed to get my emotional range back just last month! I don&amp;#39;t know what happened to cause this, if it was time or me moving out of my bedroom for once or me finally doing my homework, but what matters is my numbness is slowly but surely getting better and better. Trying to keep being productive because I think that’s what opened the emotions but insomnia makes it a little hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got suggested a chart about OCD today and was able to see my experiences with social anxiety in the definitions. Like I was so obsessive it honestly felt like I was being puppeted to be an ideal friend, but the anxiety really didn’t feel like anxiety because I never constantly felt panicky but rather like I was controlled and manipulated by my own insecurities and those insecurities just grew the more control I gave it. Actually the only other time that happened was my eating disorder, where I was basically living an illusion of control even when I knew it wasn’t real. I’m wondering if this experience was OCD or presented OCD-like traits (everything’s on a spectrum) or just regular social anxiety. I can’t diagnose myself but I really want to understand myself more and I guess this is a good place to start&lt;/p&gt;

I'm not depressed! It's been a few years since I was depressed, and what happened was I did become suicidal and I felt this crazy, magical experience of utter peace and calm and freedom because I had decided literally nothing mattered, I was going to die, that homework was never getting done, it doesn't matter.

I try to read resources online and things like that, but all of it is centered on people who are scared of death and having obsessions that they're going to kill themselves. But for me, it's not that I *want* to kill myself, but I don't know... I guess I want to be back in that place and time where there was no stress and no future to care about. I'm still surprised now that I am alive. I hate how there's very little resources for suicide attempt survivors. I, on purpose, didn't tell anyone beforehand, and wanted to make it so if I failed I could just keep on going. I did fail, so I even went to school the very next day, told no one. I'm happy now, I have friends, girlfriend, accepted into uni, life on track, all that, nothing is bad, but I just still think ""I'm going to kill myself."" every time a youtube video buffers or I drop a cracker on the floor or I get a homework assignment or nick myself shaving, or do literally anything.

When they ask why I didn't do something, I don't know what to say, because the truth is I didn't do it because if I tried I would have screamed I was going to kill myself.

ever since i was a little kid (pre diagnosis) , i always was afraid that one of my family members dying , i'd go to my parents room &amp; my brothers' &amp; see if they are breathing , call them 200 times if they are out etc..

at the start of the year my mom had a seizure caused by a 10 year old stroke that affected her brain , thankfully she is doing good with meds etc.. , when it happened i barely called 911 &amp; straight passed out , woke up to my mom &amp; dad waking me up , it scarred me &amp; amped up my ocd to the highest level since 2015

it was like the thing i'm most scared of in life , even as a 10 year old i used to pray that i would die before them. (which can bring up another compulsion that i'm a selfish human being cuz of the pain it might cause them)


these days days i literally bother them 24/7 making them check sugar/blood pressure levels , checking their meds , if i hear someone speaking in a high voice , my heart starts pounding thinking something happened to them , the thing is usually the pain of my ocd is kept inside me whatever it is , but now i feel like i'm hurting them by monitoring every single thing they do.

for an example i'll keep checking on them if they took their meds , checked everything etc.. but they are getting tired of me , i'm stuck between wanting to help them &amp; not bother them or affect them badly.

specially with covid , i'm at uni &amp; graduating soon but it has been more than 3 months since i have seen my friends cuz im afraid i'll get covid &amp; pass it to my family , i even try as much as i can to prevent them from going out , and it bothers them

&lt;p&gt;at the start of the year my mom had a seizure caused by a 10 year old stroke that affected her brain , thankfully she is doing good with meds etc.. , when it happened i barely called 911 &amp;amp; straight passed out , woke up to my mom &amp;amp; dad waking me up , it scarred me &amp;amp; amped up my ocd to the highest level since 2015&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it was like the thing i&amp;#39;m most scared of in life , even as a 10 year old i used to pray that i would die before them. (which can bring up another compulsion that i&amp;#39;m a selfish human being cuz of the pain it might cause them)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;these days days i literally bother them 24/7 making them check sugar/blood pressure levels , checking their meds , if i hear someone speaking in a high voice , my heart starts pounding thinking something happened to them , the thing is usually the pain of my ocd is kept inside me whatever it is , but now i feel like i&amp;#39;m hurting them by monitoring every single thing they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;for an example i&amp;#39;ll keep checking on them if they took their meds , checked everything etc.. but they are getting tired of me , i&amp;#39;m stuck between wanting to help them &amp;amp; not bother them or affect them badly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;specially with covid , i&amp;#39;m at uni &amp;amp; graduating soon but it has been more than 3 months since i have seen my friends cuz im afraid i&amp;#39;ll get covid &amp;amp; pass it to my family , i even try as much as i can to prevent them from going out , and it bothers them &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so either i adhere to my compulsions to keep them &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot; , or stop and break down mentally &amp;amp; live in constant fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i hope i&amp;#39;m making sense &amp;amp; someone can give me any advice or thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

830,,OCD,"Not really a question but like here's the story and I could use some advice

I have a notebook, it's graph paper and at exactly half I started a, how should I call it? A list, a list of numbers, starting from 0000 and I'm going to get to 9999 eventually. It's in pen. It's very organized in rows and the back of the page lines up with the front and even if I wrote a wrong number it still looks nice after I write the correct number.

Anyway on February 12 I realized I duplicated a number and I would have to rip out 3 pages to correct the mistake and j was pissed that I would have to waste my work and just today, March 3rd I finally did it and got going on it again

I was showing my friend the numbers because I was happy to be doing it again and he said ""bro that's like textbook ocd behavior"" and I was like ""what? No, it not, it's just my ADHD and anxiety and this calms me"" and he was like ""no. You said you got mad when you messed up and blah blah blah. Yeah that's textbook ocd behavior"" and so I did a little research and noticed many other symptoms of ocd in myself 

 now I'm thinking my ADHD was actually not real and it's just OCD instead but I'm diagnosed with ADHD

and now I can't sleep because I need to know if I possibly have OCD and just add that to the list of shit wrong with me. Sorry for kinda rambling this just is bothering me now

837,,OCD,"
Before I begin my post, I do not condone the use of any illegal substances and am simply posting my experience and it’s regards to my OCD. Take from this what you will.

You may have read the title and saw the word “cured.” By that that I mean: absolutely rid any intrusive or unwanted sexual thoughts and my sexual attraction towards the opposite gender has, although not to the same extent as before, has returned. It is something I see as a miracle. But, a little bit of background is needed to understand my personal battle with HOCD.

When I was 15 years old, I viewed P daily. It was a horrible habit. It was also around this time where I fell into the alt-right pipeline and was fueled by unwarranted hate for the LGBT community. Anything 15 year old me saw as homosexual was disgusting. One day though, I was searching for P when I simply saw the thumbnail of a gay P video. As soon as I saw it, with the thoughts of my garbage political views, I immediately had intrusive and unwanted sexual thoughts. From that moment on my life changed.

I had your typical HOCD experience. Everyday was hell. I could no longer look at a man straight in the face and lost my sexual attraction towards girls. From the ages of 15-16.5, I fought a war in my head with HOCD. Slowly, my brain recovered to a point where my HOCD was “manageable” and didn’t affect my daily life as much. However, I still never recovered from the hell that was my younger teenage years. 

Starting in the second semester of my junior year of high school, I began to smoke marijuana. I also wasn’t an alt-right shithead anymore and was friends with people from all aspects of life. The marijuana use in the beginning minimally helped my HOCD, but it wasn’t anything useful. I still had unwanted and intrusive thoughts about my sexuality that really affected me. Nevertheless, I delved deeper into the stoner community for a couple of reasons but one of the main ones being looking for any help for my HOCD. If you do not want to see a doctor, I can completely understand as I did not want to see one myself.

As I was exploring marijuana, I began to immerse myself into the realm of psychedelics. I read upon its beautiful effects on the mind and read for hours a day on people whose psychedelic experience massively helped their mental battles. This started when I began my freshman year of college. It was in December of 2020 when I was ready to have my own psychedelic experience.

It started off with a bag of magic mushrooms by the lake with my two good friends who are brothers. We brought two blankets so that we could lay on the sand. I ate the mushrooms around 10 AM that day and waited. As I was waiting though and about 30 minutes after I consumed the substance, I layed down on the blankets with my two friends. Immediately the worst anxiety, intrusive, and unwanted sexual thoughts began because I was laying down to two people of the opposite gender. For what seemed like 10 minutes (psychedelics alter your perception of time so this seemed like 10 normal minutes), I was in the most hellish part of my mind that I had ever been in. I thought I was about to have a nightmare psychedelic experience. But, I was completely wrong.

After those 10 minutes, the psychedelic realm took hold over my brain and reality itself. For the first time in 4 years in my battle with HOCD, I saw how life was without it. I couldn’t act upon any of my reassurances and when I looked at my two friends, I no longer had those intrusive and wanted sexual thoughts. It was at this moment when I stood up and for the first time in years, had thoughts that were “normal.” For the next 4-5 hours, I had a mushroom experience that really focused on myself. It was life-changing. 

For the past 3 months, I have had absolutely no HOCD thoughts. I’ve even returned some of my sexual attraction towards the opposite gender. I also had lots of other life changes that have extremely benefitted me such as stopping chewing my nails and even doing wayyyy better in school. I cried during the trip because of how beautiful it was and, from that moment on, I knew my life was going to change. 

Once again, I do not condone the use of any substances. I am simply discussing my experience with HOCD and how psilocybin mushrooms cured it.

843,,OCD,"I would like to start by saying I do not have an eating disorder, it is purely an OCD related obsession that leads me to have a very ritualistic way of eating and managing my food. 

One of my obsessions is schedule and time, I like to do the same things at the same times every single day. This goes for all things, but it is my food that I'm getting concerned about. 

I like to eat the same things every day, 6 days per week. I know this isn't healthy because the best diet is an inclusive and varying diet. 

I guess I'm looking for some advice. What are some foods you would recommend me add to my diet daily? I'm working on changing it up, but for the days I can't, I'm trying to have it be as healthy as possible. 

I eat oatmeal with protein powder, goji berries, pumpkin seeds, and either hemp seeds or ground linseeds for lunch, and at dinner, I always have brown lentils and split peas cooked in spices &amp; vegetable broth, with some canned tomatoes and lots of spinach, topped with cottage cheese. 

On top of this I eat the same brand of protein bar every day to make sure I'm hitting enough calories. Sometimes I have a sweet potato or a hard-boiled egg after I get home from work, sometimes I add in cucumber or fresh sliced tomato. 

The way I eat is a huge compulsion and ritual for me. Every Friday, I ""meal prep"" my oatmeal and lentils in little labelled containers. I think it would be really easy to add different (dried) things to my oats. Do you guys have any suggestions?


It's very difficult for me to add in ""fresh"" foods, i only really have spinach and tomatoes for my veggies, and the dried berries. Are there any dried or powdered things I can add to my ritualistic meal organization containers that might help me maintain better health?

847,,OCD,"Let me start by saying that my brain isn't a happy one. I was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder, Dependent Personality Disorder and Anxiety last year, and I strongly suspect that I have ADHD (I'm booked for an assessment, but it's not till April). But there are still some things that I do that just can't figure out.

So onto the thing. I've been doing it as long as I can remember. Sometimes it's the sounds or words that people say around me. Mostly it's tv shows, movies, songs. If I see/hear something that vaguely relates to a quote, I'll say the quote, or I'll modify the quote so it fits with the cue.

Eg, today I saw a sign that said ""Smashed avocado."" My brain went immediately to a scene from the Simpsons, wherein Homer is wearing a hat that has a camera in it. He smashes the hat and runs off, and the camera in the hat captures Apu dropping and picking up a hot dog. The scene ends with Apu saying, ""This is just between you and me, smashed hat.""

So I immediately blurt out, ""This is just between you and me, smashed avocado!""  I honestly can't control it, I can't stop myself from doing it because it happens without me even realising until it's done. It's not just the one tv show, it's literally every thing that I've ever watched. I think most of what comes out of my mouth is just a quote from something else. The only time that I don't do this is when I'm in a therapy session, and maybe that's just because I feel safe to say what's on my mind?

I just... I can't place where this tic comes from. It's definitely not autism. I don't have any of the traits (I'm female) that girls typically display with autism. Never did as a child, definitely don't as an adult.

853,,OCD,"School is probably one of the worst places for someone with COCD.

(I'm in Aukland, New Zealand. So we're currently in a short lockdown rn, but just wanted to share how I deal with school)

I go to a shitty public high-school, where I try to avoid touching all surfaces if possible. I've been studying there for 3 years, and I really can't trust other students. I use paper towels or my sleeves to pick up or hold things, I don't care if I get stared at, it makes me comfortable to do it. So every door handle or pen I use, I would have a barrier between it and my skin. I would have my hood up so that it covers my hair from germ particles in the air. I do all this even knowing I will shower everyday after school. 

This gets to the point where I'm afraid of giving my friends hugs, or other friendly gestures. Or let them borrow stationary and whatnot. It makes me feel terrible, knowing all the others are having fun, playing sport, bare feet, and not afraid to share stuff. Whereas I cannot, I could only chat and observe them from a distance. This covid-19 thing isn't helping either. Having this nagging fear and discomfort, I really don't enjoy school as much anymore.

I refuse to drink water for 6 hours until I get home, so that I would not need to use school bathrooms. I cannot stand the imagery of urine and faeces and whatnot. Sometimes, though, when I have my period, I just need to go. When I do go, I would take forever in the bathroom to do my business. I doubt the cleanliness of the bathrooms (or for all the establishments in general). I would use up a tremendous amount of TP; to cover up toilet seat, to barrier my hands, to wipe. I'm a hoverer. But if my bum touches the toilet seat, or liquid rebounds from the bowl, I would internally cry and become uncomfortable for the rest of the day. I've long stopped giving a shit about others in the bathroom, only knowing to distance myself from them. For washing hands, I would use soap and water and wash for at least 6 times before I'm satisfied. Sometimes the water rebounds from the sink and onto my underarms, and I would re-wash. Sometimes my wrist touches the edge of the sink, and I would wash that entire arm. I  hate have using public facilities like this, I do not trust them. After washing, what's next? I then wait for someone to open the bathroom door for me. 

Being paranoid about even the most minute problems makes me unfocused on school work. Going to school, all my thoughts would consist of only contamination and avoiding it. I could've be using my brain power to study, but instead I'm focused on irrational fears about contamination. 

Basically, after 3 years there, I have long since made calculations and developed this stupid routine.  I am kind of glad on the other hand. Because going to school means I wouldn't waste water at home (yeah ik it sounds bad).

855,,OCD,"TW: POCD, real event OCD, suicide, self harm

I have severe real event OCD, at least I think I do. or maybe what I did was actually so bad that I deserve to feel terrified and guilty all the time. I honestly can't tell.

the memory that is haunting me is that a year ago when I was 15 I used to do cringe roleplays with strangers online. not sexual roleplays but mostly ones that were angsty and tragic and shit. I know it's cringe but if the cringeyness was the worst part I'd be okay rn.

in a lot of the roleplays I'd roleplay a character who was in a relationship with the other character. never anything explicitly sexual but I made one kind of sexual joke, and there was romance like the characters kissed and flirted and stuff.

the problem is I did a roleplay with someone who was probably 12 or 13 when I was 15. I never had any interest in the other person, I just liked role-playing for fun. the other person had a boyfriend at the time and we both understood that it was just role-playing and neither of us liked eachother.

but I was already suffering from severe real event ocd to the point where I couldn't eat or sleep because I spent all day ruminating and panicking. this memory only flared it up again but worse. 

now my mind has convinced me this makes me a child groomer and a pedophile. not only that, but it has me fully convinced I'm going to get called out and exposed to the entire internet, and have my entire life ruined and have everyone think I'm a predator forever, and that maybe I'll even go to jail.

I can't keep living like this, the fear is too strong. I don't know what to do and nobody listens, they just tell me to get over it. but I feel like I ruined my entire life, like my family and friends are all going to find out and I'll be labeled as a pedophile forever.

I promise I didn't mean to do anything and I'm really not attracted to people younger than me but I feel like I have to kill myself because my life will never be normal again and I'm a bad person so I don't even deserve a normal life. I hate myself so much. why do I fuck up so much.

I started self harming again too. I'm trying so hard to make up for what I've done I'm so sorry.

870,,OCD,"I have my regular appointment with my psychiatrist coming up in two months because I'm already diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety, and depression. After reading about OCD over the last few days and talking with a friend who is diagnosed with it, I'm thinking there is a strong possibility I also have it, so I am planning on asking my psychiatrist about it. 

I have a few questions for people who have gone through this before:

* What should I prepare? I assume I should make a list of symptoms, but should I try to be specific about it/what level of specificity?
* One problem that I've realized is that while I've been aware that I have had intrusive thoughts for years, I think I only was recognizing certain specific intrusive thoughts (like ones about self-harm/violent things) and that all this time I think I've had way more intrusive thoughts that I just didn't realize were intrusive? And because I didn't recognize them for what they are and have assumed that they are normal, my ADHD memory just sorta tossed my recollection of a lot of them bc they weren't relevant so I'm sitting here trying so hard to search my mind for memories of times I've been affected by intrusive thoughts but that's hard when I don't exactly know what I'm looking for, if that makes sense? Like for example, (TW for talking about specific intrusive thought) sometimes when I hear/see something out of the ordinary I will latch onto specific descriptions of who I am with, what is around me, license plate numbers, the time, etc in case there is a crime happening and the police end up questioning me. I didn't realize that this was an intrusive thought/could be an OCD thing until I was talking with my friend who has OCD who does the same thing. What are maybe some examples of intrusive thoughts/checking that aren't as commonly known about that could help me jog my memory?
* For people who have gotten diagnosed during covid over video calls, what was your experience like? I've only ever been diagnosed with stuff when I was at in-person appointments and I'm curious about how it could possibly go. 
* I guess I'd just like to hear what people have to say in general about their experience getting diagnosed!

&lt;li&gt;One problem that I&amp;#39;ve realized is that while I&amp;#39;ve been aware that I have had intrusive thoughts for years, I think I only was recognizing certain specific intrusive thoughts (like ones about self-harm/violent things) and that all this time I think I&amp;#39;ve had way more intrusive thoughts that I just didn&amp;#39;t realize were intrusive? And because I didn&amp;#39;t recognize them for what they are and have assumed that they are normal, my ADHD memory just sorta tossed my recollection of a lot of them bc they weren&amp;#39;t relevant so I&amp;#39;m sitting here trying so hard to search my mind for memories of times I&amp;#39;ve been affected by intrusive thoughts but that&amp;#39;s hard when I don&amp;#39;t exactly know what I&amp;#39;m looking for, if that makes sense? Like for example, (TW for talking about specific intrusive thought) sometimes when I hear/see something out of the ordinary I will latch onto specific descriptions of who I am with, what is around me, license plate numbers, the time, etc in case there is a crime happening and the police end up questioning me. I didn&amp;#39;t realize that this was an intrusive thought/could be an OCD thing until I was talking with my friend who has OCD who does the same thing. What are maybe some examples of intrusive thoughts/checking that aren&amp;#39;t as commonly known about that could help me jog my memory?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For people who have gotten diagnosed during covid over video calls, what was your experience like? I&amp;#39;ve only ever been diagnosed with stuff when I was at in-person appointments and I&amp;#39;m curious about how it could possibly go. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I guess I&amp;#39;d just like to hear what people have to say in general about their experience getting diagnosed! &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance!  ❤&lt;/p&gt;

873,,OCD,"(TRIGGER WARNING)

Sorry, I'm new to all this, but I'm kinda going through allot right now. 

SO... over the past 2 months or so, seemingly out of nowhere, I started dealing with some pretty severe anxiety/panic attacks, only to later find out after so much research, that I am suffering from different forms of OCD, and have been throughout my life. However, it was never this bad, and when I was oblivious as to what OCD really was, I never really had any of these anxiety attacks, or severe obsessions. Or at least not as bad as they are now.

Basically, the core root of my problems, is the intense fear of going insane, constantly questioning my minds ability to develop a severe mental illness such as schizophrenia, dementia, or borderline personality disorder, psychosis, ext ext, and my intrusive thoughts have been latching onto these fears recently.

Now, what made things **INFINITELY** worse. I started searching for celebrities and noteworthy people who also suffer/suffered from OCD. I found a page that went through a bunch of different people who suffered from this cursed disease, and with that, I actually found so much solace and relief. Think Darwin, DiCaprio, Howard Hughes, ext. ext. 

Unfortunately, that solace quickly turned into severe distress as I neared the bottom of the list. The background and information on two particular individuals are the sole cause of the ""harm OCD"" im suffering from. It listed the Sandy Hook shooter and the dark knight move theater shooter as people who suffered from anxiety and OCD that progressively got much worse throughout their lives. Naturally, like a moron, I did a deep dive on the background of these two individuals, because ur brain wants to know **""just how bad can OCD and anxiety get?""**. As such, I became horrified. Now obviously, these two had some SERIOUS mental issues and their horrendous actions probably weren't solely caused by anxiety and OCD, but the fact that they also suffered from anxiety and OCD was enough for my brain to become fixated and terrified. ""Here are two individuals with anxiety and OCD, one of whom was apparently easygoing and even graduated college, that lost total control and did the most horrific things the human mind can imagine.""

Im 1000% positive that if I hadn't read about these two, I would NOT be suffering like I am now. This ""Harm OCD"" all started simply after reading about them, and was not even a problem until now. Im guessing my intrusive thoughts just latched onto these fears....?

I believe it causes me severe distress because I, as a person, am overly compassionate and deeply care about other people. I will go out of my way to help a stranger in any way that I can, so, maybe im having this harm OCD because the intrusive thoughts are completely antithetical and contradictory to who I am as a person.

 I even want to become a police officer solely due to the fact that it is a profession where I can potentially make a difference in someones life, or save someone. But, at the same time, throughout my life and even today, I did always have a fascination with wars/combat, and my brain tries to look for any similarities like that...... and it sucks... allot. I even made a pact with myself to take my own life if it ever got so bad, just so I wouldn't be able to hurt anyone.

Someone who’s 14 . But I had this one friend who was 14 for two months in grade 10. So what if I’m attracted to a 14 year old ?

885,,OCD,"TL;DR: Going through a mental breakdown and my OCD is almost gone. Kinda wanna embrace this and use it as a cheat start, but at the same time I'm scared about changing something that I've had for 13 years. Feeling very lost and confused. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*I kinda got carried away and realized this shit is way too long, so the first like 10 paragraphs are some backstory if you care, the important info is the **last 4 paragraphs**.

&amp;#x200B;

Think this is gonna be a huge rant post...

So for the past 2 weeks I feel like I've have just been mentally pushed beyond my limits. I became obsessively ""in love"" with this random Tinder girl that I've never met, I finally got the opportunity to move out and get a job, and my brother has been harassing me pretty much non stop for the past 2 weeks and no one does anything about. Being the older of 2 kids guess I'm the only one that causes shit and he's their little angel.

If I annoy him its my fault for being annoying, if he annoys me and I retaliate its my fault for hurting him...

And then I got this huge crush on someone I saw on Tinder. No idea why but suddenly suddenly she's the only girl for me. I understand this is just infatuation and I'm giving her the personality that I want and its all a fantasy, still fucks my brain though. This happens usually once or twice a year.

And the cherry on top is that my friends are getting an apartment 2 hours from where we live and they're inviting me, but I have to get a job. I'm 21, never had a job and never lived away from home because of anxiety or just laziness idk. I basically have no motivation and am a severe procrastinator so I feel like if I don't take this offer to force me away from home and into a job, I truly don't know when I will get another chance.

Now here's where the OCD comes in. I have struggled with intrusive thoughts for like 13 years now. I am a serial thought/memory note taker. Pretty much all of 2020 I spent my days on the PC and at any given moment I would just alt tab to a word doc and write my thoughts down. Over 8-12 months I have saved about 7-8 Word docs with about 2 thousand pages each. So I'm sitting on give or take 16 thousand pages of thoughts, ideas, dreams, memories, fantasies, etc.

I get thoughts that like I'm cursing people or wishing for bad shit for them to happen to them, sometimes with the thing happening in a few months or years and I spend years thinking about it and keeping that thought on my mind all the time. Like in 8th grade I thought I was gonna be dead or mentally disabled by the time I graduate high school and so for 4 years that thought had a pretty big priority in my memory storage.

Anyways, I finally snapped 2 days ago and went full rage mode. At this point I was at the ""heart break"" stage of my obsessive crush and just spent all day in my room listening music, while my brother kept walking in every hour and just fortnight dancing or like saying stupid shit to me and making faces.

At this point I kinda went into a blind rage. He ran away and tried closing the door behind him but I slammed into it so hard that I'm sure the door almost like folded over, and after that initial burst I just turned around and went to lay in my bed. I truly have only had like 5 ""blind rages"" in my life, and I've never hurt people. Off the top of my head, I once punched a hole in a wall, I did one of those like headbutt flinches at someone that beat me in 4 square during elementary school, I had a huge verbal argument with my dad but turned away before anything went too far, and then this event. Most of the time I learn to just back away before it gets to that point, but being as these 2 weeks were just pushing and squeezing me I couldn't control myself.

&amp;#x200B;

\***Main point of the post**

But yeah, then I laid in bed being all mad at myself for my emotional state, my crippling need to write every waking thought, my pathetic obsessive crushes, my pathetic sad life of just sitting at the pc browsing YouTube and reddit pretty much since I barely got out of college, and how I can't move out and become a somewhat independent adult with this current mindset. 

Now for the past 2 days since that rage and serious mental talk with myself I am in this numb, mental breakdown state. I feel lost and empty, but that also means that I also don't feel as compulsed to write down my thoughts.

Now on one side I really wanna try and take advantage of this. Fuck off with my thoughts and realize that sometimes I won't remember everything and thats fine. But another part of me is worried that this feels too easy. Right now I've only had like 10% of my normal intrusive thought, on one side I feel like if I can take advantage and really just accept this I would be able to get over it. But on the other hand it scares me that something I have been doing for 13 years can suddenly go away in 2 days? I'm worried that I mentally broke something permanently... 

I want to work on myself, but right now it feels way too easy to the point where I feel like I've just become a different person. I almost wanna go back to writing my thoughts just to feel 'normal' again. Idk what to do. And I have had mental breakdowns before and have been in this same spot, but for some reason im still scared.

But on the other hand it scares me that something I have been doing for 13 years can suddenly go away in 2 days? I&amp;#39;m worried that I mentally broke something permanently... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to work on myself, but right now it feels way too easy to the point where I feel like I&amp;#39;ve just become a different person. I almost wanna go back to writing my thoughts just to feel &amp;#39;normal&amp;#39; again. Idk what to do. And I have had mental breakdowns before and have been in this same spot, but for some reason im still scared. I want to be better but im scared of such a sudden and drastic change?&lt;/p&gt;

I spent maybe 30 mins searching the internet to see if there was possibly toxic gas from the water and poison mixture. I learned that to have the poisonis gas made u need a specific ingredient and it wasnt in the poison we had. To sum it up i was just overreacting and there was no poisonous gas made which was good.

I don’t know how to do ERP on the current obsession (and the obsessions change every couple weeks) which is I’m afraid my parents, who are the only people I’ve seen for a year, are false people as in maybe they’re robots or are re-set characters like in a video game. I blame it on watching shows like Black Mirror, put all these ideas into my head, especially during the tense, early months of the pandemic. I could of also been a little delirious that time because I thought it would be a great time to lose weight so I severely restricted my diet to like 4 oranges a day and lost 20 lbs, but I don’t know if they had any negative effect on me. I gained the weight back though :/

I’m afraid that every time I get near my parents or have an angry thought against them that maybe harm would come to them. Maybe I’d black out and not remember. I will say being alone in my thoughts for a very long period of time has made me remember a lot of things in the past year and has pissed me off that my parents always prevented me from doing certain things which hindered my career and I’m pretty pissed about that. And also I’m afraid of losing them cause they’re all I have and the pandemic has put us on edge. I’ve avoided all people during the pandemic solely because of them, not for me, because I’m more worried for them than me.

parents like telling them to get out of the way so I can get to the fridge is triggering me, afraid I’ve harmed them or something. I’ve resorted to taking short videos of them after incidents to make sure I’m not dreaming and they’re actually there lol.

Like, I’d be walking in my neighborhood and all of a sudden a car would zip right in front of me from an alley and there’s no way for me to see it coming. Happens so many times.

Also, it’s so inconvenient to go out cause then I’ll have to put on a mask and risk it since the new corona variants are floating around and then I have to take a shower to disinfect. Just easier to stay home than deal with all the hassle.

It’s been going non stop for four months straight all day every day and I’m just exhausted and at this point ready to try and live as a girl just to make it stop but I’m worried this is also a compulsion.&lt;/p&gt;

Then my mind went to ”What if I killed someone”, but figured Id have heard of someone dying on the party so thats not realistic. Now this is where it becomes annoying, I had a thought ”What if I raped someone?” (Note: Im a very calm guy when drinking, never do anything bad and definitely dont harass women etc etc..), and this thought has been stuck with me ever since.

I don’t play Scrabble with anyone over 60 because the last time I did that, something bad happened the next day. (I lost my favourite flannel.)

I don’t yawn before 9:30am because the last time I did that, something bad happened the next day. (COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic.)  

There’s this person. Let’s call her Person A. She has powers, chief among them being the ability to visit other universes where we all make decisions contrary to the ones we’ve made here.

There’s this other person. Let’s call him Person B. He has a very encyclopaedic knowledge of the fallible human mind and its prankish proclivities.

They’re a peculiar pair. They don’t seem to be of any fixed abode because sometimes when I look out my window at 2am, they’re right there, just the two of them, ambling down the middle of the empty street in their pyjamas without a care in the world. They don’t appear particularly disadvantaged beyond that because when I see them in the daytime, they’re always sporting expensive-looking business wear and swinging reusable Waitrose bags to and fro. For ages I knew them just by sight and we’d do that downward-nod-and-stiff-mouth thing when we passed one another in the street and go no further than that. 

Until yesterday, that is. They accosted me when I was on my way to the local park to cringe at the tree resembling Hagrid in a bikini. I rounded a corner and there they were. Without any preamble, they pierced my personal bubble and proceeded to deluge me with their excitable, barely intelligible chatter. 

I was like, ‘Woah, slow down’, but they kept on. Thinking they were trying to sell me something, I tried to bow out and sidestep away, but they steamrolled over each of my verbal attempts to disengage so I just gave up and started trying to process what they were saying. 

They were saying they had powers. Person A said she had unfettered access to other universes and Person B said he could read minds. Lately when we’d crossed paths in the street, he’d observed one or two things in my mind that he believed he and Person A could help me with. I was sceptical.

‘This… doesn’t sound legit,’ I said when they finally stopped yapping. ‘You’re telling me that you—’ I looked at Person A, ‘—can travel to other universes, and you—’ I looked at Person B, ‘—can read minds. Sounds a bit… fiction-y if you ask me.’

‘Alright well, have you ever stopped to examine and interrogate these avoidance behaviours of yours?’ said Person B. ‘You’ve sworn by a labyrinthine list of self-imposed rules for years now, rules that, to you, make perfect sense, but to anyone else are utterly nonsensical.’ He went on to say that despite what I’d convinced myself, my rules and behaviours were, with all due respect, entirely baseless and didn’t stand up to much scrutiny. 

‘Baseless?’ I spluttered. ‘How dare you!’

He continued. My persistent avoidance of actions regarded as mundane by the general population as my way of preventing negative events was being encoded into my motor memory, so to speak. By not holding my breath when I passed someone with pink hair and then noting the next day that I was being visually assaulted by a tree resembling Hagrid in a bikini, I was confirming to myself that the cause was me breathing normally around a pink-haired person, rather than me heading to the park of my own volition where I knew that tree would be. I was equating correlation with causation and bludgeoning these erroneous beliefs deeper and deeper into the primitive part of my brain. My avoidance was just fuelling more avoidance rather than breaking the cycle.

‘And we’re here to help you break that cycle,’ he finished.

‘And erm, can I just butt in?’ said Person A. ‘I mean, like… look.’ She pointed at the tree resembling Hagrid in a bikini standing tall and proud in the middle of a desolate field a few hundred metres away. I winced. ‘You’re reliving that negative event right now, yeah?’

‘Yeah,’ I grimaced through the gaps in my fingers.

‘But… did you even see anyone with pink hair yesterday?’

I cast my mind back. Yesterday I’d seen 20 brunettes, 14 blonds, 3 gingers and 1 green. No pinks were logged.

I was speechless. I opened and closed my mouth a few times like a fish out of water. They’d both got me reconsidering. What they were saying seemed to have merit but it wasn’t conclusive, or at least I didn’t want it to be.

‘It’s a tenuous connection but I swear it’s there!’ I protested. I guess I didn’t want to be proven wrong and have my illusory power over future events taken from me. I wanted the world to remain as moronically simplistic as my self-imposed rules implied, even though really, in the darkest recesses of my mind, I knew it wasn’t. I think I just wanted to labour under the delusion a little longer because if I accepted too soon that things were more complicated, I’d feel powerless. 

‘These connections you’ve made defy common sense,’ Person A said gently. ‘You’re blind to their absurdity because you’ve sworn by them for so long, when actually, they’re demonstrably false. We can bridge your cognitive dissonance for you if you’ll let us.’

There was something about her tone that softened me and I sensed then that I’d profit from submitting. So I let them lead me into one of thicker sections of woodland down the other end of the field where we could exit our universe unseen by any onlookers. 

Everything happened in a span of seconds. We ducked down behind a cluster of trees and joined hands and Person A instructed us to shut our eyes. ‘FWIW I think Hagrid looks rather dashing in a bikini,’ said Person B as we blinked out of existence. 

The teleportation was instant and I didn’t feel my feet leave the ground. The only things that indicated to me that we’d arrived somewhere else were the sudden spike in temperature and the ceasing of the gentle forest breeze caressing my ears. I opened my eyes. We were in my bedroom back at my old house. It was nighttime but temperature-wise, it felt like the sun was still high in the sky. Beads of sweat were already forming on my forehead. 

I looked around and gave a start when I saw myself standing just a few feet away with my back to us. I looked in alarm at Person A and Person B standing beside me. 

‘Don’t worry, we’re invisible,’ she said calmly. ‘This is universe D401. The date is 5th August 2018. Do you remember what happened on this date?’

I looked back at my other self. I was standing by my bed holding my phone. I crept closer to peer over my shoulder. It looked like I was repeatedly setting the alarm and then switching off my phone and then switching it back on again to make sure I’d set it, over and over and over again. I studied my other self’s face. I looked fed up, as if this was the 100th consecutive day that I’d had to perform this silly ritual. 

A bud of recollection suddenly bloomed in my memory. ‘Ah, yeah. This was the last time I only checked my alarm 9 times. It’s been 10 ever since—’ and Person A approached me, nodding, and took my hand. She reached out to Person B with her other hand. I instinctively shut my eyes. 

It was morning. We were standing by the front door watching my other self sifting through the post. I felt some latent disappointment get reignited because I could remember what happened next. I watched as my other self opened a profanity-laden handwritten note from the lady living across the street, wherein she admonished me for hoovering in her driveway. ‘I do not need my driveway hoovered!’ it said.

Obviously I hadn’t actually been hoovering in her driveway ‘cos who does that lmfao… I’d actually been using my metal detector to try and locate Boudica’s grave because y’know how sometimes you can just tell by looking at someone’s driveway that Boudica is buried underneath? Yeah, it was one of those driveways. If only I’d checked my alarm 10 times on the night of 5th August 2018 rather than 9, the lady across the street would never have sent me that note and I’d’ve unearthed Boudica and the drinks would’ve been on me.

I watched my other self sigh dejectedly and vow never to check my alarm only 9 times again. From now on, it’d be 10 times minimum. 

Person B turned to me as my other self slinked away. ‘Now [my name],’ he said. ‘Please explain to me why you linked checking your alarm 9 times with the receipt of this note from your neighbour.’

I explained, and when I was done, Person A and Person B stared at each other, looking thoroughly flummoxed.

‘You really make no concession to logic, do you?’ Person B said.

‘Erm, wh-what?’ I said. ‘Was the…’

Person A raised an eyebrow. 

‘…alarm thing…’ 

Person B was shaking his head in disbelief.  

‘…not the…’ 

Person A was mouthing, ‘Omg…’

‘…cause…?’

They both facepalmed. 

‘Not the sharpest tool in the shed, are you?’ said Person A as she stepped forward and grabbed my hand. My eyes slid closed.

When I opened my eyes again, we were back in my bedroom on the night of 5th August 2018, standing behind another of my selves as I set the alarm. 

‘This is universe D402,’ Person A clarified from my side. ‘Have a look now at how many times your alarm gets checked. Go on.’

I approached my other self to snoop over my shoulder. I watched as I set the alarm, switched off my phone, switched it back on again, checked the alarm and switched off my phone again, over and over again until I’d done it not 9 but 10 times. I turned back to Person A and she grabbed mine and Person B’s hands and yeah, you can probably guess what happened next. The me of universe D402 still received that unfortunate note from the lady across the street and had to bring her Boudica mission to a close. Avoiding checking my alarm 9 times wouldn’t have prevented that negative event after all. 

Person A transported us back to our own universe and the three of us went our own separate ways, with Person B mentioning offhand that Boudica’s grave is actually nowhere near the driveway of my poor, unsuspecting previous neighbour and will in fact be discovered 17 years from now in a place that he’s not legally permitted to disclose. That was certainly a plot twist of magnitude like wtf man who’da thunk it etc.

I haven’t run into them again yet, but I must remember to thank them when I do. The experience lulled me into a mild state of shock that didn’t quite lift in time for me to do so before they bobbed away. 

Anyway, yeah. Their intervention proved to be a roaring success. I now feel a less inflated sense of responsibility over events beyond my control and I glean less false meaning from actions of mine that happen to correlate with unrelated subsequent events. I now check my alarm only 9 times before bed.

&lt;p&gt;‘And erm, can I just butt in?’ said Person A. ‘I mean, like… look.’ She pointed at the tree resembling Hagrid in a bikini standing tall and proud in the middle of a desolate field a few hundred metres away. I winced. ‘You’re reliving that negative event right now, yeah?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Yeah,’ I grimaced through the gaps in my fingers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘But… did you even see anyone with pink hair yesterday?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cast my mind back. Yesterday I’d seen 20 brunettes, 14 blonds, 3 gingers and 1 green. No pinks were logged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was speechless. I opened and closed my mouth a few times like a fish out of water. They’d both got me reconsidering. What they were saying seemed to have merit but it wasn’t conclusive, or at least I didn’t want it to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘It’s a tenuous connection but I swear it’s there!’ I protested. I guess I didn’t want to be proven wrong and have my illusory power over future events taken from me. I wanted the world to remain as moronically simplistic as my self-imposed rules implied, even though really, in the darkest recesses of my mind, I knew it wasn’t. I think I just wanted to labour under the delusion a little longer because if I accepted too soon that things were more complicated, I’d feel powerless. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘These connections you’ve made defy common sense,’ Person A said gently. ‘You’re blind to their absurdity because you’ve sworn by them for so long, when actually, they’re demonstrably false. We can bridge your cognitive dissonance for you if you’ll let us.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was something about her tone that softened me and I sensed then that I’d profit from submitting. So I let them lead me into one of thicker sections of woodland down the other end of the field where we could exit our universe unseen by any onlookers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything happened in a span of seconds. We ducked down behind a cluster of trees and joined hands and Person A instructed us to shut our eyes. ‘FWIW I think Hagrid looks rather dashing in a bikini,’ said Person B as we blinked out of existence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The teleportation was instant and I didn’t feel my feet leave the ground. The only things that indicated to me that we’d arrived somewhere else were the sudden spike in temperature and the ceasing of the gentle forest breeze caressing my ears. I opened my eyes. We were in my bedroom back at my old house. It was nighttime but temperature-wise, it felt like the sun was still high in the sky. Beads of sweat were already forming on my forehead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked around and gave a start when I saw myself standing just a few feet away with my back to us. I looked in alarm at Person A and Person B standing beside me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Don’t worry, we’re invisible,’ she said calmly. ‘This is universe D401. The date is 5th August 2018. Do you remember what happened on this date?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I looked back at my other self. I was standing by my bed holding my phone. I crept closer to peer over my shoulder. It looked like I was repeatedly setting the alarm and then switching off my phone and then switching it back on again to make sure I’d set it, over and over and over again. I studied my other self’s face. I looked fed up, as if this was the 100th consecutive day that I’d had to perform this silly ritual. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bud of recollection suddenly bloomed in my memory. ‘Ah, yeah. This was the last time I only checked my alarm 9 times. It’s been 10 ever since—’ and Person A approached me, nodding, and took my hand. She reached out to Person B with her other hand. I instinctively shut my eyes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was morning. We were standing by the front door watching my other self sifting through the post. I felt some latent disappointment get reignited because I could remember what happened next. I watched as my other self opened a profanity-laden handwritten note from the lady living across the street, wherein she admonished me for hoovering in her driveway. ‘I do not need my driveway hoovered!’ it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously I hadn’t actually been hoovering in her driveway ‘cos who does that lmfao… I’d actually been using my metal detector to try and locate Boudica’s grave because y’know how sometimes you can just tell by looking at someone’s driveway that Boudica is buried underneath? Yeah, it was one of those driveways. If only I’d checked my alarm 10 times on the night of 5th August 2018 rather than 9, the lady across the street would never have sent me that note and I’d’ve unearthed Boudica and the drinks would’ve been on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I watched my other self sigh dejectedly and vow never to check my alarm only 9 times again. From now on, it’d be 10 times minimum. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Person B turned to me as my other self slinked away. ‘Now [my name],’ he said. ‘Please explain to me why you linked checking your alarm 9 times with the receipt of this note from your neighbour.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I explained, and when I was done, Person A and Person B stared at each other, looking thoroughly flummoxed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘You really make no concession to logic, do you?’ Person B said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Erm, wh-what?’ I said. ‘Was the…’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Person A raised an eyebrow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘…alarm thing…’ &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Person B was shaking his head in disbelief.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘…not the…’ &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Person A was mouthing, ‘Omg…’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘…cause…?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They both facepalmed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Not the sharpest tool in the shed, are you?’ said Person A as she stepped forward and grabbed my hand. My eyes slid closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I opened my eyes again, we were back in my bedroom on the night of 5th August 2018, standing behind another of my selves as I set the alarm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘This is universe D402,’ Person A clarified from my side. ‘Have a look now at how many times your alarm gets checked. Go on.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I approached my other self to snoop over my shoulder. I watched as I set the alarm, switched off my phone, switched it back on again, checked the alarm and switched off my phone again, over and over again until I’d done it not 9 but 10 times. I turned back to Person A and she grabbed mine and Person B’s hands and yeah, you can probably guess what happened next. The me of universe D402 still received that unfortunate note from the lady across the street and had to bring her Boudica mission to a close. Avoiding checking my alarm 9 times wouldn’t have prevented that negative event after all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Person A transported us back to our own universe and the three of us went our own separate ways, with Person B mentioning offhand that Boudica’s grave is actually nowhere near the driveway of my poor, unsuspecting previous neighbour and will in fact be discovered 17 years from now in a place that he’s not legally permitted to disclose. That was certainly a plot twist of magnitude like wtf man who’da thunk it etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t run into them again yet, but I must remember to thank them when I do. The experience lulled me into a mild state of shock that didn’t quite lift in time for me to do so before they bobbed away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, yeah. Their intervention proved to be a roaring success. I now feel a less inflated sense of responsibility over events beyond my control and I glean less false meaning from actions of mine that happen to correlate with unrelated subsequent events. I now check my alarm only 9 times before bed. This has transformed my life.&lt;/p&gt;

905,,OCD,"Hey guys, I (23F) have been reading quite a lot of reddit stories concerning ocd and I would really appreciate any advice that any of you might have. 

To start with, several months ago I got out of a 7 month relationship with a manipulative guy. Our relationship was full of insult targeted at me, stuff like I am a slut, a whore etc for sleeping with 9 guys prior to him, some of which were just drunken one night stands, one of which I remember only very hazily. We broke up as I started a very exhausting ritual of obsessing about stuff that I most probably have not even done and confessing it to him, which I believe he liked as it put him in control, anyways I decided to leave as I was not able to function even. 

Fast forward to nowadays, I am in a long distance relationship with a very sweet guy, who once mentioned he would never tolerate cheating. Guess what, my ocd went into overdrive thinking about what if I cheated while already being with him, just not being able to concentrate on work or school. 

What's more, I went over to my friend's, we drank quite a bit of wine, leaving me not feeling too well and going outside at night to get some fresh air, meaning listening to music and smoking some cigarettes. Anyways, I had been outside for some 30-40 minutes before returning. Everything most probably fine. 

However, I woke up in the morning, firstly going crazy over the thought that I might have kissed my female friend for fun and thus cheating on my bf. I have no recollection whatsoever of this, yet it wouldn't go away, until I find something better to fixate on. I bumped into like two guys outside as it's lockdown and everyone was supposed to be inside. My amazing brain has figured that even though I was texting my bf most of the time spent on my walk, I somehow managed to have sex with somebody before returning in the 12 minute pause between our texts, catching some STD or getting pregnant. 

I tried to tell my bf that even though I do to some extent realise that this is nonsense, I can't get rid of the feeling of guilt and I even keep coming up with scenarios of how it might have happened.

&lt;p&gt;To start with, several months ago I got out of a 7 month relationship with a manipulative guy. Our relationship was full of insult targeted at me, stuff like I am a slut, a whore etc for sleeping with 9 guys prior to him, some of which were just drunken one night stands, one of which I remember only very hazily. We broke up as I started a very exhausting ritual of obsessing about stuff that I most probably have not even done and confessing it to him, which I believe he liked as it put him in control, anyways I decided to leave as I was not able to function even. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to nowadays, I am in a long distance relationship with a very sweet guy, who once mentioned he would never tolerate cheating. Guess what, my ocd went into overdrive thinking about what if I cheated while already being with him, just not being able to concentrate on work or school. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s more, I went over to my friend&amp;#39;s, we drank quite a bit of wine, leaving me not feeling too well and going outside at night to get some fresh air, meaning listening to music and smoking some cigarettes. Anyways, I had been outside for some 30-40 minutes before returning. Everything most probably fine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I woke up in the morning, firstly going crazy over the thought that I might have kissed my female friend for fun and thus cheating on my bf. I have no recollection whatsoever of this, yet it wouldn&amp;#39;t go away, until I find something better to fixate on. I bumped into like two guys outside as it&amp;#39;s lockdown and everyone was supposed to be inside. My amazing brain has figured that even though I was texting my bf most of the time spent on my walk, I somehow managed to have sex with somebody before returning in the 12 minute pause between our texts, catching some STD or getting pregnant. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to tell my bf that even though I do to some extent realise that this is nonsense, I can&amp;#39;t get rid of the feeling of guilt and I even keep coming up with scenarios of how it might have happened. Can somebody please share some of their experience with this? How can I overcome these thoughts? I tried to agree with the thoughts and to tell myself that I won&amp;#39;t ever know whether that happened and so on, but it just won&amp;#39;t get better and I am starting to go crazy and the most recent appointment I can get is in 3 months. I feel that I might have believed my ex that I am a dirty whore that should be ashamed of herself and won&amp;#39;t let go, but I don&amp;#39;t know how!&lt;/p&gt;

But for me it can be like walking in my appartement and thinking I will have a horrible life in the future and get HIV (se redo till I have a good thought), log in into game and thinking I will have a horrible life and get HIV (so keep login in till I have a good thought about the future), wearing that t shirt and thinking I will have a horrible life and have HIV so change t shirt till I have a good thought with it. Sometimes there are even multiple phases for example. Login to social media (need to have good thought), open chat (need to have good thought), write something (need to have good thought), receive a message (need to have good thought). Everytime I dont have a good thought about my future I need to restart everything from scratch. Like on television there was a show and a girl couldn't eat an M&amp;M cause she tought her family would die. Like how on earth does it attach to an M&amp;M or the most random thing you can think of.

Like the social media example, sometimes I do something I have never done before on the platform and then I need to have a good thought with it. What happens next is I have to have a good thought again with everything I already have done on the platform, like closing, opening, reading a chat message, sending a message to a girl ,... If I don't I will have to do something new on the platform again, have a good thought and everything repeats. This is like mission impossible and even if you try to do compulsions you still can't find the relief cause every compulsion needs to be right and it feels impossible to do like 12 different and random compulsions in a row where you need to have a good thought (so sometimes I stop continuing being on social media if I have 3 compulsions right but I know it will be hell to try and complete every step further the next day). This takes up hours, days of time in my head and I just can't pinpoint how.

I know OCD isn't logical but the fact our life can literally be destroyed by an M&amp;M and you know this is the most absurd thing and you still can't stop the compulsion is so exhausting.

So I can get why someone develops OCD around contamination or relationships, driving, ... But for me I am like so clueless

918,,OCD,"Hi everyone, I‘m new here!

I‘m not diagnosed with OCD and I‘ve never seen a therapist. I don‘t want to self diagnose, I‘m just asking for some help and tipps.

In the last two months I‘ve experienced the symptoms that a person with harm OCD (towards themselves) has. I‘d like to see a therapist to find out what I really have and to treat it. 

Ever since last Friday, the thoughts have been pretty bad and I‘m struggling a lot. Since I‘m a student and I live with my parents, I have to tell them that I want to see a therapist. But I don‘t know how I should do that? I feel like since the things I‘ve been thinking about are very bad, I‘m horribly scared of their reaction and also that they‘d think its their fault when really it‘s no ones fault. I also don‘t want to lie to them about what I‘ve been going through.

Also, how can I deal with this in the meantime? It takes some time for me to get an appointment with a therapist, so I have to somehow get through this. I‘m feeling quite lost right now.

921,,OCD,"So today was a good day, earlier I had in interview for a paid internship who went well and  I also received my college degree by mail. After the interview I was feeling good and happy and I thought « Yeah, this is worth it, I wanna get better » but then BAM, a repressed memory/intrusive thought barged in and fuck me up. 
I’ll give some context, I have had 2 period in my life where I had strong POCD. The first one was 2 years ago and it went on for like 2 months the second started this September and has not stop since. Now my « POCD » is related to teens 15/16-17( sometimes lower but it’s rare). The first period was only toward prepubescent children. So that memory, it happened in the first period, I was barely 19 like not even a month and at the time I was browsing r./gonewild ( I don’t want to link it). At the time I was trying to entertain the idea that I was into adult woman and it’s a addicting format for NSFW stuff. (TW: going forward, I get a bit descriptive)So once I subscribed to this girl, who was cute, like the baby face type cute. I kinda liked her stuff... she was banned for being suspected/or was underaged ( my memory is blurry I can’t recall exactly) I panicked the fuck out, my response was « this is not my fault I would have never looked and subscribed to her if I knew » while it’s true, that reasoning angers me, why was I attracted in the first place. The memory is really blurry and I have difficulty remembering what she looked like, I could tell she was more young-ish looking, today I would have thought that it was sus and not even go there. But I don’t know why I didn’t realized back then, I liked that shit, when posting this somewhere else, they were comments telling me it’s fine that I was a teen also. I don’t know the girls age and I’m can’t recall enough to judge but I should have known, I can remember enough to know that their was something weird. Ironically at the time I thought the fact that my 18 years old friend was in a relationship with a 15 was really weird... I don’t know how but I was able to chase this event from my head and go on with my life. I’ve remembered this a couple weeks ago, I seem to forget easily, I don’t know why. Like know, I have kinda lost that attraction to the baby face type girl, I looked at some match of dating site a while back and I matched with some 18 years old who were young looking, it’s freaks me out more than anything now, it’s not attractive anymore. Sigh, I don’t know I’m kinda scared that I’m still secretly attracted to that or that this event mean that’s it never was POCD,  I’m surprisingly calm but also depressed about this. Like I sealed my faith or something...

I wrote this part in my work break.
So I’m calmer now, it’s still weird, it felt like this wasn’t this big of an issue wich is weird cuz it’s fucking CP, I don’t why sometimes this memory makes me fucking anxious and depressed and sometimes I’m able to brush it off and I somehow think that I’m sure I have POCD.  Sometimes I’m not sure if I’m ashamed of it, I know I definitely was at some point (I think and I wish) I’m not saying I would look for that again, absolutely not, but I feel it’s mostly fear than shame. Weirdly at some point I was a bit angry and kinda felt like a victim in the situation, I don’t know why it sounds so dumb.

925,,OCD,"Bipolar and OCD sufferer here. Both condition provoke a lot of anxiety, which is like an old friend I can't get rid of, no matter what I do or the medication I use. It's always there leaving me breathless, hyperventilating, accompanied by pressure headache and all that shit you are all aware of. 

Anyway... 

Not so long ago, I was eating some food and as I was eating I thought ""Mate... Have you realised that the only time you are not anxious is when you are eating something?"". So I did some research and apparently our brain is wired to feel safe while eating, hence we don't feel anxious when we eat. 

So then I thought, why not using chewing gum?

And this is what I have been doing since and my anxiety decreases a lot when I chew it (for maximum efficiency, I chew 3 chewing gum at the same time). I'm also more focus and witty. I can finally breath and think properly, and not feel on edge all the time.

It's not a cure but it is a good way to treat the symptoms and without sugar, it won't make you fat.

The only downside to this is that of course, after some time the chewing gum doesn't taste good, but it's a million time easier to deal with that than anxiety. 

I would recommend giving it a try. I prefer looking like a hungry cow than an anxious hamster anytime.

928,,OCD,"hi i understand this is about to make me sound nutty but this has been making me nauseous for like a week. 

so i have been with my bf for over two years. we started hooking up in october of 2018, but we were really close friends before that and would cuddle in his bed all the time— which is something that was pretty special, because i wouldn’t let just anybody touch my body like that. i didn’t hook up with anyone else, even when we weren’t exclusive.

anyways, we were pretty much hooking up (not exclusive) for a few months until march 2019, which is when we became exclusive, and we’ve been together ever since. 

this past summer, i asked him if he had sex with anyone other than me while we weren’t exclusive, and he said yes, one other person. but he knew i would spiral, so he wouldn’t tell me anything about her, and actually told me made up facts to mislead me. 

well, fast forward to last saturday. i had a nightmare about it, and basically begged him to tell
me who it was so i could just know and be at peace. he told me he lied about what he had told me originally, and that it’s actually a different girl who i actually know of. this happened right when we started hooking up, but for some reason my brain makes it feel like it happened yesterday. i cannot get the images of him having sex with this girl out of my head, and it is literally keeping me up at night. i feel so nauseous and disgusted, and i feel terrible because he didn’t even do anything wrong, yet i just feel so grossed out. i had a hard time touching him for a little while, because he just felt “contaminated” even though this literally happened two years ago. i tried to explain the feeling to him, but it just made him sad and offended. i really don’t know what to do— things have been going so well with him and now i feel like i just ruined everything. i’m so frustrated with myself because i know logically that he is perfectly clean and it’s absolutely insane to be obsessing over something that happened two years ago and i’m so tired of feeling grossed out and nauseous all the time, like i’m now dirty and contaminated because of this. does anyone have any advice on how to stop obsessing over this? i feel like i’m going crazy :-( please help me",t2_7f86huq5,False,,0,False,can’t stop obsessing over my bf hooking up with a different girl over two years ago,[],r/OCD,False,0,,0,,False,t3_lwnnnp,False,light,1.0,,public,6,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Venting,False,6,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1614783629.0,text,0,,,text,self.OCD,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;hi i understand this is about to make me sound nutty but this has been making me nauseous for like a week. &lt;/p&gt;

OCD has been latching onto my sexual thoughts lately, mostly stuff about ‘is it objectifying?’ and things like that. But it’s also kind of moved onto something else now. I’ve noticed that for whatever reason, sexual thoughts and fantasies greatly increase/become harder to resist having whenever I’m lying down in bed. Naturally, this means it ends up happening a lot when I’m trying to go to bed at night.


My older sister sleeps in the bedroom next to mine, we’re just separated by a wall. The problem here is that I have a worry that I genuinely can’t tell is actually rational or not, as OCD could definitely be involved. The strength of the urges I get while in bed mean that I always inevitably keep giving into them and fantasising over and over again, even when every time I stop and feel ashamed and like a creep for thinking about that kind of thing when my sister is only in the next room. It’s a continuous cycle of telling myself not to do it, doing it, feeling bad, and then repeat.


I’m motivated to post this now because something happened last night that really made me feel awful about it. For whatever reason, the fantasy is most vivid when I lie face-down. Furthermore, when I do that, I often exert pressure on and move my body around - I don’t necessarily know why, it just helps in conjunction with the fantasy. But - and here’s kind of a gross part, just a warning - last night after giving in and doing this multiple times I noticed I’d caused precum to come out, possibly partially as a result of the pressure placed on my groin.


Another gross thing - when I was younger, I used to masturbate sometimes when someone was in the next room. I’ve grown up and realised how disgusting that is, but the proximity of this incident to that worries me. Is it even that much different?


On one hand, I feel like the fact that I’ve never questioned this before means most people probably haven’t and it’s just classical obsessive overthinking, so it’s fine. But I don’t know for sure. Even if it isn’t fine I’m scared to realise I’d still probably find it difficult to stop.

935,,OCD,"Hey guys, long post ahead but I could do with a friend. 

  I had my Pfizer vaccine two weeks ago and live in the UK. I was surprised they asked me, I do not have a GP as I have moved lately so had to ask the Dr who reviews my medication, he said he did not know why; they must have looked at my files.
I have severe OCD, which means I’ve essentially been isolating since the start of lockdown, but I’ve never really been helped by doctors or mental health services who just up the doses of my pills and send me away for another year with promises of a waiting list. I’ve been on a psych ward twice for suicide attempts, once for four months , and my eating gets very bad with my OCD; meaning my weight can drop as I stop eating altogether when contamination fear becomes too much and disinfecting food becomes too hard. I also started talking to an alcohol counsellor about my alcohol use which is caused by OCD (I also have to disinfect alcohol).

Now because I’ve been so let down by the services that were supposed to help me over the last ten years, I was naturally suspicious to be invited for a vaccine. Why would people who had put me on antipsychotics for sleep aged 16 because I was having night terrors and then look at me blankly for the next ten years when I mention how they’ve stolen my life as I’m so tired all the time and can’t sleep without them, even though they’ve admitted it was wrong to ever put me in them; suddenly want to help me?  A year into them, I tried to get off them, now it’s been ten. 

Anyway... I took the vaccine, much like I took the pills aged 16, because I was desperate and didn’t care for the reasons, or I did but anything had to be better than living in fear right? 

Now I’ve taken it, I’m wondering why I was offered. I’m not a key worker. It barely seems doctors listen when I talk to them. My pills don’t seem to be immunsuppresants.

One of my OCDS is HIV. Two years ago, I slept with a guy who I was in supported housing with. Only once, and he didn’t cum and I also gave him head once and he didn’t cum.  He died a month or so later of an overdose and I was called in to be questioned on the nature of our relationship; it turned out he had HIV. So, I had to be tested. I had a pin prick test and a blood test at the hospital, then I had another a few weeks later at a clinic. All negative. A few weeks later, I went to the doctors and requested another one - I think it had been around three months since I’d slept with him and I’d read about incubation periods. Again, negative. I didn’t believe it though so a week or so later I requested a full blood count. My tests came back there was nothing wrong with me. My doctor at the time said ‘there is NO WAY you have it. You need to get that out of your head.’ 

I read online about probability and knew I probably didn’t have it; but naturally I went to the articles that said it could have six months incubation period or more, and became convinced I had it anyway. Being selected for the vaccine.. I wonder if doctors know something I don’t? Maybe I have hiv and they haven’t told me?

Thanks so much for reading.

936,,OCD,"Ever since I was young, I remember looking at the world differently. It seemed I always “read into things” more. I always had to know why, for what, who, when, and how?

As I am approaching the age of 18 the monster that lives inside my head has reared its ugly face in it’s entirety. I’ve struggled extensively with POCD, Philosophical OCD, HOCD, Rape OCD, Sexuality OCD, Moral OCD, Relationship OCD, and more. I’ve been through 4 month longs bouts of torturous dissociation and have convinced myself of the most ridiculous things due to my paranoia. 

I genuinely struggle every day. Even when the obsessive thoughts aren’t there, I have a feeling in my chest like there’s something lurking right under the surface: if I look at one wrong image or hear one wrong lyric in a song I am fucked. 

My thoughts have always been extremely loud. The voice I think with is crystal clear and booming all the time. I am so utterly mentally exhausted it’s ridiculous, and I’m at the point where I get a lot of suicidal thoughts... I would never do it, but I find comfort in the thought of putting an end to it.

My dad says everything is in my head and that I’m crazy. Some friends make fun of me for worrying relentlessly about things they don’t worry about: “I drank moonshine last night and now I feel weird, could I have methanol poisoning? I kissed a girl, am I sure it was consensual?! What do you think? My girlfriend likes to go on drives, what if she’s just meeting some guy to fuck? What if? I thought that girl was pretty, should I break up with my girl right now and just save the pain? Am I a rapist? Am I a terrible person? Should I turn myself in?”

It all feels real. I’m getting better but this is such a big beast to fight. Weed barely helps and makes it worse a lot, last time I tripped I sent myself down a dissociative episode for months because I got into philosophy, and alcohol makes me cry.

938,,OCD,"The reason why I’m unsure it’s POCD (TW)

So today was a good day, earlier I had in interview for a paid internship who went well and  I also received my college degree by mail. After the interview I was feeling good and happy and I thought « Yeah, this is worth it, I wanna get better » but then BAM, a repressed memory/intrusive thought barged in and fuck me up. 
I’ll give some context, I have had 2 period in my life where I had strong POCD. The first one was 2 years ago and it went on for like 2 months the second started this September and has not stop since. Now my « POCD » is related to teens 15/16-17( sometimes lower but it’s rare). The first period was only toward prepubescent children. So that memory, it happened in the first period, I was barely 19 like not even a month and at the time I was browsing r./gonewild ( I don’t want to link it). At the time I was trying to entertain the idea that I was into adult woman and it’s a addicting format for NSFW stuff. (TW: going forward, I get a bit descriptive)So once I subscribed to this girl, who was cute, like the baby face type cute. I kinda liked her stuff... she was banned for being suspected/or was underaged ( my memory is blurry I can’t recall exactly) I panicked the fuck out, my response was « this is not my fault I would have never looked and subscribed to her if I knew » while it’s true, that reasoning angers me, why was I attracted in the first place. The memory is really blurry and I have difficulty remembering what she looked like, I could tell she was more young-ish looking, today I would have thought that it was sus and not even go there. But I don’t know why I didn’t realized back then, I liked that shit, when posting this somewhere else, they were comments telling me it’s fine that I was a teen also. I don’t know the girls age and I’m can’t recall enough to judge but I should have known, I can remember enough to know that their was something weird. Ironically at the time I thought the fact that my 18 years old friend was in a relationship with a 15 was really weird... I don’t know how but I was able to chase this event from my head and go on with my life. I’ve remembered this a couple weeks ago, I seem to forget easily, I don’t know why. Like know, I have kinda lost that attraction to the baby face type girl, I looked at some match of dating site a while back and I matched with some 18 years old who were young looking, it’s freaks me out more than anything now, it’s not attractive anymore. Sigh, I don’t know I’m kinda scared that I’m still secretly attracted to that or that this event mean that’s it never was POCD,  I’m surprisingly calm but also depressed about this. Like I sealed my faith or something...

I wrote this part in my work break.
So I’m calmer now, it’s still weird, it felt like this wasn’t this big of an issue wich is weird cuz it’s fucking CP, I don’t why sometimes this memory makes me fucking anxious and depressed and sometimes I’m able to brush it off and I somehow think that I’m sure I have POCD.  Sometimes I’m not sure if I’m ashamed of it, I know I definitely was at some point (I think and I wish) I’m not saying I would look for that again, absolutely not, but I feel it’s mostly fear than shame. Weirdly at some point I was a bit angry and kinda felt like a victim in the situation, I don’t know why it sounds so dumb. It feels like I’m not grasping that I was aroused by a minor ( writing this feels weird, not stressed, not relieved, but weird a bit emotionless). At some point I told myself that I should forgive myself, but wtf why, it kinda feel easy and uncaring, I don’t think it’s my place to do that... or I don’t know. I’m not proud I think, I really don’t want to say this carefree to my doctor... my appointment is tomorrow and I’m confuse now. It’s weird I kinda wanna say that I wish it didn’t happen but something is not letting me think that, but I don’t want to do that shit again either, it annoys me... maybe this was traumatizing idk...

My boyfriend has actual ADHD though and his range of symptoms are much different from mine. He gets extremely hyper focused on things and when he’s fixated on something he won’t even acknowledge anything else in his surroundings. I don’t get that at all. There’s also quite a few other discrepancies between our behaviors and habits as well. 

I’ve been recently diagnosed with OCD so I’ve been looking more into it and apparently OCD is misdiagnosed as ADHD quite frequently. I thought that was really quite interesting as I think most people would categorize those two conditions as completely separate.

He gets extremely hyper focused on things and when he’s fixated on something he won’t even acknowledge anything else in his surroundings. I don’t get that at all. There’s also quite a few other discrepancies between our behaviors and habits as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been recently diagnosed with OCD so I’ve been looking more into it and apparently OCD is misdiagnosed as ADHD quite frequently. I thought that was really quite interesting as I think most people would categorize those two conditions as completely separate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone else here experience attention deficit like symptoms? If so how do you manage them? I find it’s one of the most difficult things for me to manage especially while working from home and not having a strict schedule to adhere to. I have a really hard time focusing on my work and I also procrastinate really bad on doing things I actually want to do. It’s been making me feel really depressed and like I’m just lazy or terrible or something. I’m on meds currently which helps with the compulsions but I think are making these other symptoms worse. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;

955,,OCD,"For me, confession compulsion has always targeted my romantic partner. I feel like if I don’t disclose any transgressions I’ve made in my past, or since knowing them, then I’m a totally dishonest liar who doesn’t deserve love. (Logical me knows this isn’t true, but OCD me tries to convince me that it is.)

Anyhow, I am currently in a new relationship (about two months in, but we had about a month or so of getting to know each other/courtship). I’ve managed to keep my confession compulsion at bay this far. How?

When I feel that anxiety, that urges to spill my guts to my newfound love and tell her all the bad I’ve ever done so that she can see the “real me” and decide if she wants to be with me or not. I ask myself this:

Would I want to hear the same things from her? Or would it just upset me? If she told me about some sexual thing from her past, it would just make me uncomfortable. If she told me she found someone else attractive it would hurt me. If she told me she was still chatting with someone else when we first met, it would just make me feel insecure. 

NOT BECAUSE ANY OF THESE THINGS ARE WRONG OR WOULD MAKE HER A BAD PERSON, BUT BECAUSE I SIMPLY DONT NEED TO HEAR THEM. 

I’m just using these as examples of some of the ridiculous things I’ve confessed to previous partners or gotten the urge to confess. 

We all have things we’ve done that we aren’t proud of, and we will likely continue to do or say things we aren’t proud of. 

But please, next time you have the urge to confess what a “monster” you are to your partner. Ask yourself that question. What purpose would it serve your relationship? And would you REALLY want to hear the same from your partner? 

Good luck, friends. Nurture your relationships, don’t sabotage them by giving in to OCD.

962,,OCD,"I’m 16 and for the past few years I’ve been struggling with what I think is OCD. It all started when I was like 12 or 13. It started with me getting really obsessive over how my character in video games would look and it never seemed to look right and I would spend all day trying to get rid of that feeling and just wasting my time. At this point I had no idea that was OCD. A bit after this time I found that watching YouTube, a movie, or anything on TV I wouldn’t be able to focus and I would be thinking about a small thing that was bothering me, like the position of the computer mouse or the position of the tv remote or what shirt I had on, little tiny things that would occupy my mind so much. After I realized this it made me feel bad and that I couldn’t truly enjoy the experience of these things because my mind was occupied. Up to now, I still struggle with things like this, only way worse. Every day I spend way too long deciding what I want to wear to school. I’ll just sit there trying to think about what shirt or pants I could wear that wouldn’t bother me all day. Eventually I pick one and then it proceeds to be on my mind throughout the whole day anyway. Small things like this on my mind make me feel terrible and they’re truly on my mind 24/7, even when I’m relaxing or having fun with friends there’s always something in my mind saying somethings off, like what I’m wearing or what shoes I have on or whether or not I have to use the bathroom. The bathroom thing sometimes causes me to go to the bathroom and try to pee over and over again even though i can’t at all. It just feels like I need to get everything out but I can’t so I keep trying. When things like this are on my mind it clouds my thoughts and I can’t think properly. I get anxious when I’m about to meet with friends sometimes because I don’t know what I’m gonna say to them and I feel like they’re gonna lose interest in me because I won’t have a conversation with them properly. As of lately I’ve been thinking about all these things and I don’t know why but it feels like everything I’ve been through the past while has been clouded by these OCD thoughts and I truly haven’t enjoyed a single moment in so long.

We were talking at dinner with another family member, and we were talking about how my sister was always playing an online game that she loves. My sister plays this game for hours a day and messages about it from her iPad and plays online with her friends. My mom started talking about how she even texts about it and she has seen the things she sends her friends about it, and she talked about a specific video that my sister sent. She said that she gets emails whenever my sister messages someone and is able to see what she is talking about. Then my mom said “my kids don’t know how much I can actually see” and smiled at me. This horrified me. For context, I have obsessions about my online presence and people being able to see what I’m doing online (I’m not doing anything illegal or creepy, I just like being private). This also applies to social media, and I have deleted several accounts on different platforms before because I don’t want to be seen by others. Me and my mom do not really have a good relationship, there is no trust between us and I can’t really talk to her about anything. I am ok with this because I have a couple really close friends that I am very open with and text every day. I talk to my friends about really niche, weird fandom things, people I have crushes on, and overall a lot of really personal stuff. The idea of my mom reading my texts horrifies me. I have said some very personal things to my friends that we keep between us and I do not want anyone else to see what I said. I don’t know how she does this, maybe it’s something with iCloud or Apple ID or whatever, but I do not want her to be able to see the things I say.

977,,OCD,"I understand the mechanics behind ERP, at least to an extent. And I understand that it might be particularly useful for specific fears that can be treated with exposure in-person: if I’m scared of e.g. dogs, I can understand that gradually exposing myself to dogs to show my brain why dogs aren’t actually scary might work.

What I’m struggling with is imaginal exposure, and what I’m meant to think / respond with when I’m doing it. Suppose I expose myself to a story or narrative about my fear (e.g. I’m going to kill my child). That gives a whole lot of anxiety. But what do I tell myself about the nature of that thought while I’m doing this?

1. If I say to myself ‘that’s not true, I’m doing this for exposure, this is just OCD’ am I really exposing myself to the thought? I am giving myself reassurance, and often won’t believe it even if I come to a conclusion here...

2. On the other hand if I tell myself ‘this is true, or could be true’ I get so triggered and distressed that I can’t get on with my day at all. And it would affect my behaviour: if I really believed the thought and thought my child was in danger I would take steps to protect it.

3. The third route is to accept uncertainty, something I often see in OCD circles, but really this just a variant on acceptance: accepting I could kill my child. Again, if it were that easy I would have done it. And I don’t see how living normally with the idea that I could kill my child is possible. It’s a question of degree.

I dont want to live the rest of my life alone and hating myself but I dont think I can forgive myself. I am afraid that there is something really wrong about me. Even if I do have ocd I can&amp;#39;t blame it for all of my thoughts because some of them are old. I am just tired and I want to accept myself again but it seems to impossible because if I would think I am ok and not bad person that would make me a bad person.&lt;/p&gt;

I can't do anything right now. Anything I do my OCD tells me it's because of some other bad thing.

If I say I had enough, then surely it's because I saw random thing Y and that ultimately put me in this line of thought so if I do break free from this theme it's only thanks to Y (which is always a bad thing like a bad person or event). This is one of the worst themes for me, I can't even perform compulsions to escape it. I'm even afraid that if someone replies to this post with useful advice, well what if this person is a pedophile?? I can't let a pedophile be the thing that frees me from this theme!

I can't take this anymore, I've had religious OCD when I was 13, had harm OCD at 16/17, general OCD (checking stuff a thousand times) my entire life, but nothing comes close to the amount of suffering I'm having with this thing called pOCD right now as I'm 22yo. At this point I'm pretty much convinced I'm a disgusting p### in denial, I can't sleep or eat properly, stopped doing everything I loved (such as listening to music, drawing, playing games), I basically just can't stop thinking about this pOCD all day and night. Whenever I see or think about children, I feel movements in my groin and this weird anxiety feeling in my stomach (I don't get hard though), and I just want to k#ll myself when that happens, I spend a long time just questioning myself stuff like ""did I feel atracted to that child? omg i think i felt attracted, omg"", yesterday something really weird happened, I tried masturbating to ""test"" myself and at first I was thinking about adults (as I always did), nothing happened, I couldn't feel aroused anymore, but then this image of a child appeared in my head and suddenly I got this horrible feeling as if my stomach was turning upside down due to anxiety, and I ejaculated right away, but it didn't feel good.. I felt nothing while ejaculating, literally nothing, and if anything I became even more desperate about being a p#do, at that point I just thought it was a death sentence to me, I went to bed and couldn't even cry myself to sleep, all I could do was lay there and think about how my life was over... eventually I fell asleep and woke up feeling calmer, I remembered that I had this kind of experience in the past, such as when I was masturbating and intrusive images of my mom or my grandpa would appear in my head for example, and I'd ejaculate right away (without feeling anything, just out of sheer anxiety), so that made me calmer... but I'm still scared, I mean there's something blocking me from feeling attracted/horny to adults now, idk whether it's OCD playing tricks on me, or whether it's because I'm depressed, or whether I've been in denial of being a p#do my whole life and now I'm ""finding out"", I'm just so f#cking scared, I can't tell anyone (like a therapist or doctor) because they'll probably think I'm a p*do and report me to the police, can't tell my mom because I think she'll hate me, I'm feeling hopeless right now. Right now I'm in the waiting room to see my gp and tell him that my OCD is ""acting up"" to see what he can do (won't tell the exact type of OCD though).. I'm currently taking Celexa 20mg but it's just not helping at all, so my only hope is to find a stronger medication and just pray that it'll go away on its own, though I'll probably be asexual from now on, since I cant even masturbate to the (adult) porn videos I used to, just dont feel nothing anymore, I mean I do feel but it's just much less strong than I used to (the arousal or idk)",t2_aksxr7sc,False,,0,False,pOCD (?) is ruining my f*cking life,[],r/OCD,False,0,,0,,False,t3_lw7ip1,False,light,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Venting,False,3,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1614734847.0,text,0,,,text,self.OCD,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warning: Some parts of this post will be disgusting to read.&lt;/p&gt;
