The Hotel whilst old is relatively well appointed and the staff are very attentive. Service can be clunky at time which is more due to language barriers than anything else. Several options for wining and dining all of which provide a reasonable level of choice. Breakfast choices are many but none of what is was available was memorable, the food was OK and nothing more. Mandarin Orchard's biggest plus is it's location. I have stayed in Singapore several times before and there are other options of similar price that for me offer far better value for money.
