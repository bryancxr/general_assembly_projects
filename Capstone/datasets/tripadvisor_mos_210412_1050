Located right in the middle of Orchard Road, you are within minutes of the luxury shops, the wife was very happy! The hotel room was great and the breakfast variety was brilliant, we did not miss a day of breakfast. The staff were amazing and do their best to accommodate all your needs.

Room size was good, but the decor is showing its age, thus my title that they need to upgrade. I also had dinner at the Chatterbox, very good food with reasonable (in Singapore standards) price.

I became very ill and we couldn't go. We tried to move the booking to next May, only to be told that we needed a doctor's certificate to ""prove"" that I was ill. I didn't get a certificate. They went ahead and charged us for the stay, even though we wanted to move the booking. Robotic, uncaring, uncompassionate and officious are some of the words that come to mind about this incident. Very unhappy with their lack of flexibility and terrible customer service (they were exceedingly rude to me on the phone when I tried to negotiate moving the booking). We are going back - but will never stay here. Bad customer service needs to be highlighted - so beware if you need to change plans or whatever",2.0,2015-11-01

However big, the living room was hot and stuffy and after calling the hotel front desk for assistance, there's nothing they can do for us.

Upon arrival at about 9:30pm I was told I must check in downstairs as my booking was through a corporate agent, so I stood behind a group of Japanese business men who were putting the poor sole girl on the desk through hell, after 10 mins the greeter that told me under no circumstances could I check in upstairs approached the desk to see what the fuss was, looked at me then left the lobby, after another 15 mins where I was about to tell the business men where they could stick their demands for having rooms nearby each other (since the poor girl obviously couldn't do this herself) she asked them to wait while",6.0,2015-08-01

As I am fortuante enough to stay freqently at top hotel (such as exist in Dubai etc.)  I was underwhelmed by the hotel.  For instance - restaurants/bars close at 11pm - really? At least one should have remained open to cater for business folk who work long hours.
