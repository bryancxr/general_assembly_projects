Good selection of toiletries and nice options for the mini-bar (if a little expensive). Bed very comfortable.  Good balcony (small but functional), we choose the side of the building overlooking the Gardens by the Bay which looked magnificent both day and night.  Infinity pool was nice but very busy, I recommend going either late at night or early in the morning to avoid the crowds as its not really relaxing swimming with fifty other people who are all trying to get the perfect selfie.

Staff were friendly and helpful, breakfast buffet had a good variety of options. My one gripe is no power point for the hairdryer in the bathroom. It's very difficult drying your hair with no mirror!

The staff are fantastic, always available, willing and able to help, unfailingly polite and highly skilled. Even when asking for directions (the complex is huge) or serving you in one of the many restaurants or bars, they are friendly and experienced. The infinity pool is clearly the main pull and highlight of most guest's stay. I used the pool at 7am for lane swimming, 3pm for relaxing and 10pm for the thrill and it was always well kept, managed and run. Rooms are large and well appointed with good quality furnishings and extra touches like complimentary bottled water (not cold though!), plenty of toiletries, robes/slippers.

First off, when we arrived, we were escorted to the VIP check in desk (though we just booked a regular room). They had noticed it was my friend's birthday and quickly upgraded us to the top floor with a much bigger room and the view of Marina Bay Gardens. To top everything else off, they also sent us up some chocolates for my friend's birthday, which was a very kind gesture. The room was clean and modern. The view during the day and night was spectacular! The gym also had an amazing view of the city skyline. The bar C'est La vi was beautiful. Plenty of restaurants with decadent food.

As soon you enter the hotel you can soak into the luxury the hotel has to offer. We were directed to the check in counter and their we were offered complimentary drinks and ice creams. The check in guy was very courteous and he suggested us an upgrade to club room. Believe the services that you get in a club room are no match for the price they charge. He gave us this lavish, grand beautiful room on 46th floor with garden view. As soon as you enter the elevator you feel the grandness of the place and feel as a sultan of some place. Our room had a tub, shower area, and lots of space. We were given complimentary high tea and evening cocktails at club 55 which were very elaborate. Our room had a",10.0,2017-12-01

The staff are also universally charming and helpful, provided you do not ask them anything out of the norm. This was particularly the case on check-in and check-out where the staff really seemed to struggle with English and to deal with the inevitable questions, leading to long waits for most.   The lifts are also a trial with long waits and often very crowded, so getting on at floor 55 to go to the lobby can often entail being squashed against the walls by someone in a damp robe and ten or more stops. Rooms are also not really 5*. Small details like there is no dressing table or plug points in the bathroom so hair drying is a matter of",8.0,2017-12-01

Upon arrival for an extra S$200 per night we upgraded to a club room.  The room and views were spectacular and we needed some light refreshment after our long flight. This is when our troubles began because the enormous hotel was fully booked and the hotel management seem more preoccupied with guests maybe taking what has not been paid for. Unlike the much more relaxed approach at our second hotel, the incomparable Shanghai la, we found the staff picky about even having a free cup of coffee in the club room.  We booked a meal on the iconic pool deck and were told that we were not permitted to bring in food and beverage, which seems to us a very strange instruction for such an expensive hotel.
