The room was just what we wanted - comfortable big bed, massive bathroom and a small balcony overlooking Marina Bay Sands.  We had a lovely afternoon tea at the Courtyard - free flow savouries and sweets with unlimited coffee and tea.  The breakfast was good too despite the huge number of guests eating around 9am.

All I had to do was to get my husband, appropriately dressed, to the hotel.

They are bringing a bad name to Asian cuisine, which is such a beautiful and tasty thing!
