A writing desk with office type chair, TV and foot stool. On the other side of the room was a cabinet for drinks and a fridge. Bottled water was supplied every day.  Spacious bathroom with bath and walk in  large shower. Separate toilet with heated seat and wash functions.  Balcony with superb views over to Fullerton 1 with a fantastic panorama. Lovely to sit out on an evening and watch everyone passing by. Amazing views at night. Make sure your room does not have a flag pole or your views will be diminished.

As I am claustrophobic and want some light into the room that is natural I asked to change .
