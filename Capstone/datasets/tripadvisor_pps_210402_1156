It was during formula one race time. No problem for them to rent the room to someone else. I contacted them to ask for a refund and I suggested them a deal. No way! They didn't enter in any discussion. They hardly refused and kept 3600 sgp for the cancellation (the fully paid amount for the booking for 4 nights) It's clearly scandalous. I am traveling regularly all over the world. But I will never ever go in a hotel from this group. such contempt is unacceptable.

The trip started well with a great check in experience and a bottle of wine and cake in the room. However breakfast on the first morning was disappointing - especially considering we were in the Pacific club restaurant. Both my wife and I had eggs and describing them as bland is a compliment. I also asked for a French press coffee as the machine coffee served was poor. For a five star hotel I had expected this to be provided as standard but unfortunately this was not an option.  The experience of the Pacific Club Lounge was poor when comparing this to the Harbour Grand Hong Kong. The biggest let down is that alcohol was only complimentary between 18:00 - 20:00 and at all other times was chargeable.   That said the room,8.0,2016-09-01

One thing we did notice was the food at the pool bar was so expensive, for 2 meals and cokes it was $100 which if you had a big family is a bit steep to buy every day. We stayed 7 nights and got a balcony and the view was amazing, would recommend!! The only thing that ruined it for us was it being the hotel for all the rugby sevens players who took over the pool with training and were filming so it took the holiday relaxed feeling away from us which was a shame!

Upon check in, the hotel staff brought us to our room and even offered a baby cot for our baby girl even though we did not requested for it.

Service was generally good except one time we were locked out of the rooms, the electronic door lock had an issue, so we couldn't get into the room.  We waited for almost 40 minutes for someone to come and get it open for us. In the end, we were given a free ride to the airport as compensation.  I'm sure these kinds of problems do not happen regularly. Else, the hotel was very nice. Good staff, facilities were clean and breakfast was lovely.

We had a wonderful greeting by Celeste and easy check in to the welcoming anniversary treats in our beautiful room! We had a city view which was lovely at night to see the lights. We recommend the upgrade to club floors with option for breakfast in the club lounge and afternoon tea and evening cocktails every day. Club lounge greetings are everyday with a smile thank you to Siti, Mahesh, Syam and Rafael for making us so welcome and looking after us during our stay. MRT is the only way to travel - so cheap clean and easy and Promenade station is very close to the hotel. Hotel staff can recommend places to visit.

Rather odd dress code in the lounge where you can´t wear sandals without straps at the back. Ridiculous and unprofessional that I actually was asked by a waiter to switch shoes!!

Beautiful hotel in a super convenient location, I couldn't not fault my entire stay. We booked a lead in room and were upgraded to a panoramic King view room on the 27th floor. We didn't have views of Marina Bay, but still the city view was enjoyable. Paid no more than $10 in cab fares to Marina Bay / Clarke Quay area and the MRT is a short walk away if you don't want to pay for a taxi. Suntec shops across the road with plenty of dining options too. Our room was spacious, comfy large bed, and large bathroom with a nice bath tub too. Highly recommended! ",10.0,2016-02-01

I did visit OTHER hotels during my time in Singapore and found their Lobby areas and general check in areas was like standing in the middle of a busy Highway.  From the moment one enters the Pan Pacific , one is greeted by a smiling attendant who makes you feel important and welcome.  I stayed on the 29th floor and used the outside scenic elevators which always give you a ""Singapore Eye"" type view as you go up the higher levels.  The room levels are very quiet , peaceful and very discreet in their entries.  This makes the room ambiance more attractive as you have already passed through a peaceful ambiance just getting to the room. My room had a",10.0,2016-02-01

Effortless check-in, with information on the free wifi usage in the room. Also, we requested for a room in the highest level, she assisted to get us a room on the 32nd floor (which was the highest floor for our category - panoramic room). The room was very clean and well-made during our 3 days stay.
