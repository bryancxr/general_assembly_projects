Another disadvantage was the access to the club lounge as they were hard for an elderly person to climb up. The bathroom that holds the towels felt unsafe and wasn't sure when it would fall off.

This was at 930am. I would not stay here again with family. Our freinds had a room on the smoking floor and the entire floor smelt like a bar the morning after - stale cigarette smoke.
