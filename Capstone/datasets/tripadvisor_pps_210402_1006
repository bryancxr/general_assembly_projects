It is close to several malls with restaurants for breakfast (or other meals) and convenient shopping  We definitely had a positive experience, but it didn't meet the expectations from other reviews.  From the start, there was a lot of attempted up-sale; surely we would want to pay for breakfast at the hotel ahead of time, of course we would want to upgrade to a bay-view room.  Only guests in the most expensive rooms have access to the upper floors; we had hoped to view Singapore from the top of the hotel, but that wasn't possible.

The staff from Steve and Rafael down to the gorgeous lady who tidied up were just so thoughtful, caring and made us feel as though we were the only people in the hotel. I am sure all other guests felt the same. The Wi-Fi was excellent. It was our wedding anniversary during our stay and it seemed that almost every employee knew as we were wished Happy Anniversary by so many different people. The hotel even supplied a chocolate cake and a bottle of wine to help us celebrate. One of the best and most enjoyable stays we have had anywhere in the world. If you don't enjoy your stay here you would have to be extremely difficult to please. David and Irene.",10.0,2017-07-01

Although we didn't have any food inside the hotel as it was a little pricey for us, this mall is connected to Suntec mall and Millenia walk which have so many restaurants including those famous Singapore food courts. Marina bay sands and all the main attractions are merely a kilometre or so from the hotel.  Be aware that all attractions in Singapore are over $30pp.   The pool at the hotel is also fabulous with a bar and kitchen.   They have everything at the hotel.

When we needed a place to eat to celebrate my husband's birthday, Keith from the front desk was really friendly and helpful, and recommended Hai Tien Lo to us.

Being able to make calls and use maps while I was out and about was extremely helpful.

What could be improved is staff care. Little/no eye contact, a bare greeting and the staff lacked sparkle and personality.  Get them to be less afraid of guests, chat more and smile. I stayed at a Jumeirah before and housekeeping made me a towel animal every night - that's the thing I'd remember as a great staff experience.  The pool area is fantastic, good quality sun beds and towels, but the water could do with a sift from tree leaves and the staff don't venture out of the bar to offer service. The Chinese poolboy cannot speak a word of English and gave me 3 knives but no forks.   ",8.0,2017-07-01

The hotel is well connected to shopping malls, a short walk from the MRT and close to many other facilities and attractions. Check in was quick and although I arrived several hours before the standard check-in they managed to find a room allowing me to spend the rest of the day seeing Singapore. The room was comfortable, clean and well maintained. Two things helped make it feel more like home: the tv stayed on the channel last viewed (rather than switching to a standard channel) and the bed was not re-pillowed after every housekeeping.",10.0,2017-07-01

Went to check in and the gentlemen behind the counter attempted to upgrade our room and charge us extra. Felt like he was a sales person and on selling targets of some sorts. I informed him we came from a very long flight, after we stated no to the upgrade he replied you must wait 4 hours. After approx 40 minutes i again approached the counter and this time magically a room came free and they simply gave us a key. Nothing else was said, no breakfast times, no advice on sites to visit, no advise on how to use the lift system etc. Also with this hotel i found that you cannot use the sky lounge on the top floors as you have to be a club member or pay a very high fee.

We travelled as a family of 5, asked for adjoining / communicating rooms, and a spare roll-out bed for our youngest.  We arrived late, no adjoining room were available, we got the two rooms next to the lift, and there was no spare beds.  It was already 12PM and it took an hour by the time all that was sorted (not the adjoining rooms).
