The thing about getting the highest floor is that any one can access to it because the gym is on the 37th floor. If you stay on other floors, you need your room card to access.  Breakfast was the same thing for all days. It's usually full at Triple Tree at about 9am and they inform you to head to Chatterbox. They say that both places serve the same thing. From observation, Triple Tree has more to offer. Waiting staff weren't attentive. Some tables weren't equipped with the basics like salt, pepper, sugar, milk, stirrer.

Every year we stay in Singapore with 10+ people for the trade show. I liked the hotel from the start but there are a few smaller things that we were not happy about. #1- Upon check in there were no double rooms available, just twin rooms. We had booked many weeks in advance and were surprised to hear this.  Next day we could switch to a double room. The next day my friend still had to wait 1.5h hours before he could go to his new room. We thought that arriving back at the hotel at 18.00h would have given them plenty of time.??  They booked us in the Orchard tower which gave access to breakfast on the 28th floor, which was nice. I ate there just once though. Breakfast on the ground floor was",8.0,2015-03-01

What a complete surprise. Afternoon tea between 1500-1700 was not just drinks but a full suite of various snack foods. In the evening the complimentary cocktails was between 1800-2000. Again this included any drink you wish and there was so much hot fool to chose from all at a very high standard. We booked breakfast and this again did not disappoint. The breakfast in the restaurant by comparison was £25 per person. An excellent hotel with excellent staff and would certainly recommend it to anyone travelling to Singapore.,10.0,2015-02-01
