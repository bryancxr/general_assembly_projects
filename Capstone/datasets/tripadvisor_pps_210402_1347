That done, we slept for a few hours and then admired our harbour view.    The room was excellent, and we'd bought online a package which included club privileges, so we did most of our eating and drinking there.  For breakfast, though, we could use the main restaurant, which had an outstanding buffet, as well as eggs, orange juice (!) and the like prepared for you.

The room (3310) was spacious with amazing views of the harbour and city skyline, including the interesting Marina Bay Sands architecture.

The booths in the main bar area look cute, take up most of the area. They are designed to seat 6-8 comfortably, but usually have only 2-4, so space is therefore at a premium. Perhaps a reservation system would be useful here. The room we stayed in on Level 7 is good,  but showing its age. Hotels like Marina Bay Sands and One Farrer are now the rising stars in Singapore.

The sound proof of the hotel room was exceptional. I could hardly hear anything outside the corridor and that is worth extra applause, since it allowed my child to get good quality sleep together with the extremely comfortable bedding.  There are alot to choose from the buffet breakfast and the quality was above average for all types of cuisines offered.

I agree with previous reviews that the reception area is confusing and unwelcoming and the chances are you have to ask at at least one desk to find the correct one! Better signage is required alongside more smiling from staff. We cannot fault the club lounge and service and the cocktails and canapés are some of the best in the world.

The hotel is stunning it is extremely clean and definitely worth upgrading to the studio harbour view rooms to get the view especially if more than 1 person in the room as it gives you a little more space and the bath for kids. The pool area was very quiet which was nice and the location is very central. It helps taxis are so cheap but it was also walking distance to lots of attractions if it's not raining or to hot!  The bar was lovely although a little pricey but that is to be expected in Singapore.

Let me expound on the staff - the concierges patiently answered our questions, marked up our map repeatedly and directed us to discounts when they applied. Thank you Nisha, et all.

Free wifi was available for use on my multiple devices.   The bed was very comfortable. I struggled a little bit with the opening and closing of the curtains before I got the hang of it.   I had breakfasts and a room service dinner and the quality of food was excellent. I also had a multi coursed Chinese conference dinner which was very nice. My only complaint was that they appeared to run out of glasses and it took a while before a drink was served.   There are 3 MRT stations in the hotel's vicinity making travel easy.

The hotel is within easy walking distance of the bay and the esplanade, Raffles and several shopping malls. BUT be warned its not always easy walking around the city as pavements are intermittent and there is currently some building work near the bay that's blocking the most direct route from the hotel to the bay.

Being a professional travel photographer looking to shoot panoramas of the city, I had contacted a number of waterfront hotels in the Marina area to see what rooms they could offer me that were on high floors with either opening windows of balconies. Answers from both the Ritz and Mandarin Oriental were cursory at best, their customer service people could definitely use a bit more customer service training!   Ms. Dawn Lee of the Pan Pacific was great, on the other hand! She understood what I was looking for and even went to several of the rooms to take shots with her phone so that we could have visual proof of the views. Loved that!

Turned out to be a great decision!  It was around 7 p.m. when we checked in.  At check-in the front desk suggested we might be tired from our travels and we should go ahead and visit the club while it was evening cocktail hour and they were also still serving light snacks.

Rooms are clean, functional and well equipped but don't try to call the 'Concierge' to collect your luggage, it is all automated and can take up to 90 minutes for them to arrive to collect. Didn't eat in the hotel apart from breakfast on one morning, lots of choice but we had to queue for 25 minutes to get a table as it was so busy!
