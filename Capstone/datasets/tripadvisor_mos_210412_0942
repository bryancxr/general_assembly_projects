Easy walking distance to MRT stations, shopping, restaurants etc. Taxi's are all metered & cheap also. We caught the MRT most places, was super easy & convenient. We loved our room - so spacious & comfotable. We had full access to the club lounge where we enjoyed breakfast each morning along with afternoon tea daily & drinks & canapés each night. Nice variety of items. Small negative I have is that the temperature of the food served was not hot, it was luke warm. We did notify a staff member but it hadn't changed the next time we went.

At night when I came back, I was quite shock because the room was quite old (hasnt been renovated). I was too lazy to go back to exchange room, it was just too troublesome.

Rescheduling policy is somewhat restrictive (48 hours advance notice even for changes in reservation) but the hotel tries to minimise impact when possible. Breakfast is good and varied if you go to the main restaurant. Taxi line can become crowded during peak hours so account for it if you have a tight schedule. However hotel staff will assist to prioritise hotel clients. Also have several dining options and a shopping arcade to ease your stay if short on time - if not the location ensures lots of alternatives.,8.0,2016-06-01
