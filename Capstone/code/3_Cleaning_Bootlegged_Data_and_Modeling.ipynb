      "However, the rest of the stay there proved just as good.\n",
      "It is worth saying though, the hotel complex is absolutely huge and very busy, so may not be everyone's cup of tea.\n",
      "Our stay started well, as check-in was incredibly smooth and helpful.\n",
      "We checked our suitcase in, as we thought as it was 12pm, our room wouldn't be ready.\n",
      "There was no need to do this, as our room was ready to check in to - fantastic!\n",
      "We stayed on the 23rd floor, with garden views.\n",
      "The room was huge, with a balcony, and large\n",
      "This hotel is massive!\n",
      "Over 2000 rooms spread over 3 towers.\n",
      "People in the \"lobby\" constantly on the move.\n",
      "15 -30 minutes wait to check in, or check out!\n",
      "Can be chaotic, despite the best efforts of the very helpful staff.\n",

      "This was easily the best hotel I have every stayed in, this is the standard of customer care every hotel should have.\n",
      "On arrival we were taken out of the long check-in queue to the VIP check-in, this may have accounted for the stunning room on the 32nd floor.\n",
      "Our luggage was stored then later taken to our room.\n",
      "Our room wasn’t ready but we were given a pass to use the hotel facilities, and after we checked out were invited to shower in the gym before flying back to the UK.\n",

      "I visited the Marina Bay Sands hotel and visited the Sky Bar to see the views of Singapore.\n",
      "Top tip, if you pay to go to the observation floor you have to buy tickets and there are no benefits on that floor apart from amazing view.\n",
      "If you buy tickets for the Sky Bar which is in the 57th floor they give you vouchers to the same value as your tickets which you can spend at the bar, so in reality the view costs you nothing.\n",
      "Food and drink are available and the views are incredible.\n",
      "I didn't stay at the hotel but walked through the Lobby as I needed to visit the Skypark.\n",

      "You really get what you pay for at this hotel.\n",
      "Our room was always clean and had a more luxurious design approach.\n",
      "Great views, clean room, great bathroom and comfy beds.\n",
      "The pool definitely is amazing with stunning views to the lion city.\n",
      "The staff was friendly, but you really get treated as a tourist or as a wealthy person which some guests might be used to or like.\n",
      "We didn't have any breakfast at this hotel, it is way to expensive!\n",
      "From a luxury hotel like this, it would really be nice if the breakfast was included or even maybe a special deal for hotel guests.\n",
      "Food and drinks in general are on the more expensive side.\n",
      "The location of this hotel is a tiny bit far away from the traditional and central\n",
      "Had an amazing time here!\n",
      "We wanted to come and stay here for so long\n",

      "There is a casino attached, the mall, and the public transport train is there too.\n",
      "Very central, and every staff there from check-in, bell boys, random staff all the way to check out have been extremely kind and helpful.\n",
      "The pool obviously is a must see, it is a very busy hotel, and you can easily get lost but it's amazing.\n",
      "I can't wait to come back again!\n",
      "Yes it is not cheap but the service food and pool with great views is outstanding When we arrived 8pm got our room and went straight up to the pool you can have just a light snack or meal and drinks Our room was great with great views Breaksfast was first class at the rise would highly recomend staying here Staff are very helpfull\n",
      "Stayed at the MBS Hotel for 1 night with my Wife and my 19 year old daughter who was visiting.\n",
      "We booked in mainly to have access to the Swimming Pool on the 57th Level.\n",
      "There are Pro's and Cons as always.\n",
      "We really enjoyed our stay.\n",
      "The checkin was really easy and the staff are extremely nice at the front desk.\n",
      "The serve refreshments and ice cream while waiting, which wasn't very long.\n",
      "We stayed in the Family 1 bedroom and I can say the room itself was very nice and very spacious.\n",
      "The pull out couch which was located in the outer living room was not comfortable.\n",
      "Suitable for a 6 year old\n",
      "maybe but not a larger teenager or adult.\n",
      "Very lumpy like most pull out couches so don't expect anything better.\n",
      "Our biggest grip was the location of the room.\n",
      "We were on the 4th floor and\n",
      "It looks spectacular and it is.\n",
      "It costs SGD22 ph to go to the 57th floor, however this comes off you drinks 🍸, which expensive, however it is the experience.\n",
      "Looking over Singapore city, the harbour and it’s attractions .\n",
      "We also visited in a tour , but that was only to the 56th floor .\n",
      "The queues at night are enormous.\n",
      "Yet another Singapore ‘must visit ‘ venue/attraction.\n",
      "We considered staying at MBS , glad we didn’t, apart from being expensive, the queues at checkin/ checkout were enormous.\n",
      "Stayed here for 5 nights in a Club room with an amazing view of the marina.\n",
      "This hotel is very busy so do not expect relaxation.\n",
      "In – Check in was a little slow but the staff were coming around with drinks to keep everyone refreshed in the queue.\n",
      "We arrived early and the room we were told would not be ready for another hour.\n",
      "They gave us guest keys in the meantime and advised we could go up and check out the pool or go for afternoon tea in the Club lounge while we waited.\n",
      "Room – Great view in our room of the marina which is what we had requested and did not disappoint.\n",
      "Great view for the light show that happens every evening 8pm.\n",
      "9pm and 10pm.\n",
      "Pool – Went to the pool for literally half hour was not impressed at all.\n",
      "The water was cold and the pool was full of people\n",
      "Fabulous hotel, but we had a hiccup with our booking and dealing with a Concierge man who had never heard of commonsense made me very frustrated.\n",
      "I walked away and returned 10 minutes later to speak with someone who was able to solve the problem very easily.\n",
      "We had three rooms in total, 2 on the 30th floor and 1 on the 19th.\n",
      "The 30th is obviously better to see the lighting show and also access the pool on the 57th floor.\n",
      "The lift servicing the 19th floor terminates at 22, you then change lifts to reach the top, so we spent a great deal of time in and out of lifts!!\n",
      "Rooms very large, also the bathrooms with double sinks and then toilet and shower each had their own doors,  There are no changing rooms by the pool, but towels are provided.\n",
      "We found the pool quite cool and\n",

      "We enjoyed the whole experience and the infinity pool with great views, which is world renowned.\n",
      "We will definitely be coming back again one day.\n",
      "Thank you Marina bay sands.\n",
      "I first visited the Sky Deck of the MBS in 2016 and knew then that the next visit to Singapore would be in this hotel.\n",
      "The club rooms are amazing and we'll worth the money, especially for the view.\n",
      "The club lounge on the other hand was good, but not as good as other 5* hotel we have stayed in.\n",
      "We had to register in a room tucked away in the corner of the building, which was smart and comfortable with hot and cold drinks at our disposal.\n",
      "Although we enjoyed our time at MBS and the pool was amazing, the thing I love about entering a 4* + hotel is their amazing lobby's with great artwork, plush furnishings and chandeliers.\n",
      "The MBS is like entering a huge shopping mall with a hotel on the upper floors...\n",
      "This is among the best places to stay if you have in plan to visit the main touristic areas.\n",
      "Most can be quickly reached on foot, and for the rest there's a short Grab or MRT.\n",
      "Get the cheapest room possible.\n",
      "It's not like you're going to admire the skyline or garden for hours on end from your top floor suite...\n",
      "Go to the pool as often as possible, although crowded most of the time the experience is truly memorable.\n",
      "If you stay until 11 PM when the pool closes, you'll be able to take some great night-time pictures.\n",
      "The breakfast is simply amazing in diversity, the array of choices is almost dizzying if you eat at the Rise restaurant.\n",
      "On the top floor the view is nicer\n",
      "but there's less choice of food.\n",

      "I also tried out the rooftop bar later on.\n",
      "That place had a very nice vibe too--with a DJ and live musician indoor, and again some great views outside.\n",
      "If you're willing to pay extra money while in Singapore, then I do recommend this place.\n",
      "I have stayed at many 5 star hotels but what usually gets me at the end is the not so 5 star customer service.\n",
      "Marina bay sands was wonderful, the staff was great throughout our entire stay to the very end.\n",
      "Our flight leaving Singapore wasn’t until late at night and they were able to store our luggage with access to it whenever we needed and also offered us a room to shower so we weren’t sticky from being outside all day before catching our flight.\n",
      "Club55 is good, but still not sure if it’s worth all the hype.\n",
      "To have access you do need to be staying at the hotel in a room with club access so it was nice and quiet compared to some of the other options.\n",
      "Great nightclub on the 57th floor also.\n",
      "Con: the infinity pool is filled with kids splashing around everywhere making it\n",
      "Our family of 4 (kids ages 9 & 6) booked a Family Room at MBS over Easter weekend, arriving on a Friday night and staying until Monday morning.\n",
      "I had been prepared for the family room to be on a low floor with poor views - but we totally lucked out with a room on the 27th floor with a view of Gardens by the Bay!\n",
      "We had a huge balcony/terrace with 2 seating areas as well.\n",
      "The room itself was very spacious with a king sized bed, TV/console divider, and then a double pull out couch for the kids.\n",
      "Like everyone we were there for the pool and took full advantage of jet lag with 6AM swims!\n",
      "We didn't eat any full meals there; just the SweetShop and at the food court in the shops attached to the hotel but both of those were great.\n",
      "Be sure to sign up for the Sands rewards card for\n",
      "Yes, maybe it hasn't the colonial atmosphere you would like in a hotel in Singapore.\n",
      "Yes, sometimes it looks like an aiport lounge.\n",
      "But when you arrive from the airport the first thing you see of the city is Marina Sands Bay and you will never forget this vision, NEVER!\n",
      "We arrived at 8am and checkin was so fast.\n",
      "Our room was not ready and we took a visit at Gardens by the Bay.\n",
      "Lunch at Satay by the bay (very good!), back to hotel at 2pm and lift to infinity pool (WOW!!!).\n",
      "Relaxed at the pool 'til 6pm then we visited Marina Sands shops and after dinner the light show of super trees from the Marina Bay Deck.\n",
      "I arranged a surprise Singapore trip for my husband’s birthday and as a once off been able to stay at MBS was icing on the cake.\n",

      "Had to go and see this hotel and were allowed to go to the top to the bar to have drinks.\n",
      "We arrived at just after 10 and within seconds you are deposited at the top to be greeted by friendly staff and to this amazing view.\n",
      "Drinks are expensive but not much more than you would pay in any 5 start hotel and whilst charged $56 to go to the top it is given back to you with drinks.\n",
      "What a fabulous few hours spent looking at the view and having cocktails and just very relaxing.\n",
      "Hotel looks great and just amazingly built.\n",
      "Huge recommendation to see if only for the view.\n",
      "We were not allowed into the pool area as we were not guests but saw lot's of people in gowns coming from the pool and they looked happy.\n",
      "The Hotel is clearly a must when visiting Singapore.\n",
      "In my personal opinion, the hotel is like a Mall, with a lot of people, the check in process is not very fluent, even though we were offered water and Ice creams while waiting, still slow.\n",
      "If you want to swim in the famous pool, you must stay in the hotel, besides that, the hotel is more an tourist attraction than a place to rest and enjoy the city.\n",
      "Is very well located, so you could probably visit Singapore and stay the whole place (Hotel, Pool, Mall, etc) so it is up to personal choices.\n",
      "The hotel itself is stunning as the architecture is amazing!\n",
      "The roof top pool is a great experience and looking over the bay from the Skydeck is also great.\n",
      "However, due to it being so popular it does have a 'conveyer belt' feel to the stay.\n",
      "There are always masses of people checking in and out and pool itself gets very hectic.\n",
      "The rooms are very nice and well kept, but nothing exceptional.  \n",
      "It's definitely exciting to stay there and enjoy the facilities, but it's not a luxury hotel experience!\n",
      "I booked and upgraded this hotel to 45 floor.\n",
      "This was a dream and best experience we ever had.\n",
      "It’s got the view and infinity pool was the best experience we ever had.\n",
      "If you visit Singapore, please stay at this place at list for 1 night to experience what it offers.\n",
      "Worth the money\n",
      "I came, I saw, I swam.\n",
      "Hotel is what one might expect- a gorgeous, overpriced wonder with everyone taking photos at the pool.\n",
      "The service was average.\n",
      "The room size was spacious.\n",
      "Overall, I don’t regret staying here but would consider a different hotel for my future Singaporean travels.\n",
      "Once the novelty of the pool and architecture wears off, the value of staying here take a plunge for me.\n",
      "First time in Singapore and only have three nights?\n",
      "Well, this is definitely the place to stay.\n",
      "   Great service, great rooms, incredible views from the pool and plenty of nightlife with terrific restaurants at your doorstep.\n",
      "Hawkers markets are nearby if you want to try what the locals eat!\n",
      "Our second time at this hotel, the room was immaculate and staff service impeccable, especially the lovely ladies in club55; Ellaine, Sabrina, Jesan, Farah, Kate and\n",
      "After just one visit they remembered our names and greeted us by name every time we visited the club lounge.\n",
      "The rooftop pool was very busy as usual and sometimes difficult to get a lounger.\n",
      "MBS is not a cheap hotel, however we recommend paying extra to get a club room as the service and food quality of breakfast, afternoon tea and evening canapés is outstanding as is the free flowing champagne offered in the early evening (piper-heidsinck).\n",
      "You also get a room high up in tower 2 which is convenient to get to the pool.\n",
      "Xi-mei cleaned our room beautifully and made the towel sculptures pictured.\n",
      "My wife and I had a 3 night stop over in Singapore and set 1 night aside to stay here as it was something we had wanted to do for years.\n",
      "Our experience was extremely disappointing and left us wishing we had just stayed at the Pan Pacific where we spent the the 2 nights previous and was by far a better hotel.\n",
      "The service at Marina Bay Sands was terrible.\n",
      "The staff were slow, rude and really unhelpful.\n",
      "I’m guessing they reserve the best service for those arriving in Bentley’s or who are wearing Rolex’s.\n",
      "The room was very underwhelming and the hotel had the fell of a shopping mall.\n",
      "Then there was the pool.\n",
      "Wow it was awesome to spend the afternoon in a pool with a thousand other people.\n",
      "I’m sure my review would have been better if it wasn’t for the atrocious service\n",
      "Due to the size of the hotel be prepared to wait to be checked in.\n",
      "You do have an option of not paying a deposit that will keep the fridge locked.\n",
      "The best thing about the room are the views.\n",
      "Otherwise the room looks pretty average.\n",
      "What was nice was the electric blinds theat open automatically as soon as you enter the room, 3 ply toilet tissue and the TWG tea bags but no bidet in the toilet.\n",
      "The shower functional but basic.\n",
      "The views from the obsevation deck are amazing.\n",
      "Best has to be the infinity pool that goes to the edge of the building.\n",
      "You can tell from the skypark this is no ordinary hotel.\n",
      "I would recommend at least spending one night so you can experience the skypark as its only available for the hotel guests.\n",
      "The other benefit is the gardens by the bay,\n",
      "We stayed here for 4 nights on a recent visit to Singapore.\n",
      "The hotel is everything you would expect and the staff and food were both absolutely excellent, but the pictures do not do the infinity pool justice.\n",
      "Its simply stunning, with views out over Marina Bay on one side and the Gardens by the Bay on the other.\n",
      "And, surprisingly its not crowded, there are lots of loungers available to watch the Singapore skyline from.\n",
      "We had the best sleeping and waking moments with an awesome view of Gardens by the Bay.\n",
      "Service was superb.\n",
      "Our room was cleaned several times a day.\n",
      "The staff were all courteous, very attentive to all our requests and honest.\n",
      "I left ex gratia for the housekeeping every time\n",
      "but nobody took them so I enclosed them with a thank you note on our last day.\n",
      "Don't miss cocktails by the pool during sunset.\n",
      "It's a bit crowded while we were there but the view was so amazing so we didn't mind having a lot of photobombers.\n",
      "It's absolutely on the pricey side but with the kind of service we've experienced, I wouldn't mind coming back.\n",
      "We spend 4 nights at the Marina Bay Sands hotels and we had 2 connecting skyline view rooms.\n",
      "The service was excellent from the arrival at the airport to the return.\n",
      "The view and the roof top pools are unique and are worth the experience.\n",
      "We enjoyed the food court next door as a much more relaxed atmosphere and huge variety of choices.\n",
      "The hotel can be quite busy at time with long queues at checking or check out but we were spare those by check-in in the room.\n",
      "We definitely recommend this hotel for a stay in Singapore.\n",
      "This is simply the place to stay in Singapore.\n",
      "Choose a room with city view (Deluxe with Sky View are perfect) and you will be delighted.\n",
      "Perfectly located, with plenty of services and amenities like the famous infinity pool (a bit crowed) and the sky deck.\n",
      "Even you can't afford to stay in this hotel, there are things you can do at low cost or no cost.\n",
      "The food court here is not as expensive as the restaurants in the hotel.\n",

      "Iryn was on your first day but done a spectacular job nevertheless.\n",
      "She Was very professional and accommodating, alongside her trainer Aram who was very helpful with our requests.\n",
      "Marina Bay Sands is a great place to visit, and wouldn't be the way it is without the friendly staff whom I encountered.\n",
      "Check in is slow, the large foyer is currently under constructions will likely be more welcoming when completed.\n",
      "We had booked two rooms and we were split on to different floors (irritating)\n",
      "Elevators are also slow and you need to swipe room key wait for board to flash and then press floor.\n",
      "We paid for the premium rooms and one certainly was - the other was not.\n",
      "The room on floor 27 had an obstructed view, no verandah and was very dank smelling (like a laundromat).\n",
      "Floor 29 had sweeping views of the gardens from the verandah.\n",
      "The toiletries are very high quality.\n",
      "Rooms are reasonably clean, blandly dressed and not in brand new condition with reasonable wear and tear, the design layout is impractical in part (bathroom and toilet lights are located next to door, toilet and shower\n",
      "Great thing about staying at MBS is you do not need to leave the hotel.\n",

      "Minus one star when we got off taxi nobody came to help us with our luggage.\n",
      "I told the front desk and couple guys were free standing around.\n",
      "When booking this hotel I had doubts that it would be worth as much per night as a Ritz Carlton and Mandarin Oriental (all are on the Marina Bay).\n",
      "But upon check in I knew I had made the right choice!\n",
      "For reference, I had booked the Premier Room City View.  \n",
      "Firstly, they let me check in at 7:00 AM!\n",
      "I was expecting them to say the room wasn't ready, but they were very accommodating and gave me a room right away.\n",
      "Upon entering the room I could see why this is a 5-star hotel.\n",
      "Great room and amenities.\n",
      "Second, the POOL is INCREDIBLE!\n",
      "I am not a huge sit by the pool and do nothing person, but here, I spent hours in the pool and sitting by it.\n",
      "Where else can you be 57 floors up swimming around looking over the city?!\n",
      "This was very, very impressive!\n",
      "The pool alone is worth spending\n",
      "We stayed here on 28th May one night on way to aus.\n",
      "A experience to remember, a fabulous iconic hotel that deserves its reputation.\n",
      "View from 18th floor garden view was spectacular.\n",
      "Could easy become impersonal due to size but this is negated by staff being so helpful and willing to please.\n",
      "Even buffet breakfast in any of designated restaurants was excellent.\n",
      "The person who seats you once learns your name Thanks you by name as you leave helps keep it personal.\n",
      "Also who can leave without mentioning infinity pool on top floor this was worth the one day visit on its own\n",
      "Stayed for layover night in a Premier City View Twin room.\n",
      "Twin bed too small to sleep with kids.\n",
      "Should be queen size for that.\n",
      "Pool was crowded as expected.\n",
      "Positive atmosphere was caused by sunset and dawn light.\n",
      "Spago cocktails and sushi quite good but not special enough for the prices.\n",

      "We had been staying in Singapore for a week and so were early for check in.\n",
      "Arriving at about 11am we walked straight up to check in - no queue and was greeted by a lovely lady who explained our room wasn’t quite ready but that we could register which would allow us to get a key and head up to the infinity pool.\n",
      "We left our luggage at reception and headed up to level 57.\n",

      "You become part of the other 5000 people staying there.\n",
      "Staff are rude and you are offered no assistance with cases.\n",
      "Once inside good luck finding where you are meant to check in, especially if you pay the extra for a club room.\n",
      "Once you get to your room be ready to be dissapointed.\n",
      "Club rooms with garden view are smaller than rooms on the other side of the hotel (cleverly you are shown the large room even if you book a garden room... naughty).\n",
      "The infinity pool is impossible to get to with every man and his selfie stick vying for space.\n",
      "Trying to find a spot for a drink in the evening which felt luxurious was impossible.\n",

      "Club access gave a huge room, afternoon tea, Champaign etc.\n",
      "Breakfast on top floor was incredible and enjoyed the pool.\n",
      "Can't wait to come back\n",
      "Best way I can describe MBS is if McDonald’s was a hotel it would be Marina Bay Sands.\n",
      "It genuinely feels like a drive through.\n",
      "There is nothing really wrong with it, it just feels impersonal and detached.\n",
      "Architecturally it’s a marvel of engineering but it lacks the most important bit... personality.\n",
      "The pool attracts the worst kind of visitors, the social media influencers and bloggers.\n",
      "Selfie here, selfie there, take a photo of everything I’m consuming.\n",
      "Oh and Russians.\n",
      "Those pesky Russians and their desire to wear the hotel provided robe and slippers from their hotel room on level 4 all the way to the pool on level 57.\n",
      "For some reason the rest of the folk follow that trend.\n",
      "Breakfast at Rise is simply outstanding, pay the money folks and enjoy a great breakfast.\n",
      "Too popular with tourists.\n",
      "Meaning even upgrade areas are busy.\n",

      "We watched the tree show from our balcony, truly beautiful.\n",
      "We were able to eat within the hotel with a child and felt welcomed.\n",
      "The shopping available within the hotel is on another level and whilst we weren’t there to spend, we enjoyed the experience of walking through seeing all that sparkles!\n",
      "this was my third visit to this hotel so as we had arrived around 2 pm in the afternoon and we had booked some higher category rooms we were in the ever waiting check in queue more in the front and were lucky that our rooms were ready as still some people were asked to wait as check in time is 3 pm and check out time is 11 am they really need a lot of time to get the rooms done > the lobby as usual crowded as if the rooms are for free and mind you this prices here are not cheap> now for the good things the rooms as usual good > the shopping mall and the casino it has all what else you need and to top it all the infinity pool just amazing loved it the service and the cocktails at the pool deck just amazing > one word Enjoyed my stay\n",
      "Excelent location to see night show at the gardens and laser show.\n",
      "Room is average and has my pet hate auto mini bar.\n",
      "Pool is good but far too busy.\n",
      "Resort on a whole is way too touristy.\n",
      "If you are going to stay here do it for a night, tick the box and go somewhere else.\n",
      "There are many better options in Singapore.\n",
      "You cannot miss it, with its three tall towers with boat strung across the three towers.\n",
      "We were having high tea in the Renku Bar & Lounge on the ground floor.\n",
      "Then after tea we visited the Sky Park viewing platform.\n",
      "4 friends visited Ce la vi club lounge for drinks.\n",

      "Strongly advise a trip here when in Singapore\n",
      "Stayed at the Marina Bay Sands on a 3 night trip for a friends birthday.\n",
      "Checking in was no problem and our room was up graded.\n",
      "The room was very clean with views out to the garden and sea.\n",
      "The infinity pool opens at 6am and this is probably the best time to go get a lounger by the pool, we were still on uk time so this was not a problem.\n",
      "The pool does get very very busy but it is a must to visit and see Singapore from a high height.\n",
      "The hotel is very large with three towers.\n",
      "Again it does get very busy\n",
      "but the size of the hotel can accommodate this.\n",
      "There are several restaurants and bars around to visit.\n",
      "Try happy hour!!!!!\n",
      "There is a large shopping mall under the hotel with all the worlds top designers which my wife found to her delight.\n",
      "All in all this was a great hotel\n",
      "I stayed at MBS one night because it was too expensive to stay for the entire length of our trip to Singapore.\n",
      "You have to stay there to actually use the infinity pool but outside guests can go to the top to take pictures without being in the pool.\n",
      "Though definitely luxurious\n",
      "and we don't gamble and we thought it the location was just so-so.\n",
      "We didn't eat at any of the restaurants in the hotel because Singapore is all about the hawker stands.\n",
      "We did like that it was close to Gardens by the Bay\n",
      "but it's proximity to everything else was a little bit far for walking.\n",
      "We moved to a boutique hotel in Chinatown afterward and liked that vibe a lot more.\n",
      "Besides the pool, it was just another very big and over the top and overrated hotel but still a great experience just for that one\n",
      "The Infinity Pool is certainly great and the view from the hotel rooms is rather nice.\n",
      "But to be honest, that's it.\n",
      "I've stayed in this hotel a few times now\n",
      "but I probably won't return.\n",
      "The hotel is way too big and you have the feeling of being on a market rather than in a five star hotel.\n",
      "There are much better places to stay in Singapore if you are looking for beautiful and luxurious rooms as well as personalized and polite service (e.g., Raffles, InterContinental, Fullerton).\n",
      "We also visited the bar and the drinks were average (if at all).\n",
      "Interestingly, however, the bar keeper did not engage with us nor was he friendly above average, but he gave everyone a card with his name asking to write a positive TripAdvisor review about him.\n",
      "Well.. Looks like this place is desperately\n",

      "location is good and not far from the main places.\n",
      "overall enjoyed thoroughly\n",
      "Booked a club room which allows access to lounge book in rather than front desk, treated like VIP’s, we were upgraded to a suite which was such a wonderful surprise!\n",
      "What this hotel manages to do is make you feel special despite many visitors and lots of tourists.\n",
      "Once in the tower blocks the busyness outside melts away, you truly feel you have exclusive access to one of the most amazing hotels in the world!\n",
      "The suite was breathtaking with views that surpassed anything experienced before.\n",
      "Every need is catered for, bath products fabulous and the beds and pillows so comfy.\n",

      "Great views and not over crowded.\n",
      "Great shopping centre\n",
      "and you must do the light shows and the water laser show.\n",
      "Only downfall is they don't do enough shows!\n",
      "Other thing is everything is very far apart and not great signage around the location therefore you get lost trying to locate things.\n",
      "For example when we wanted to go to Gardens by the Bay we asked and we were told a long way round when in fact you can go through the hotel itself.\n",
      "You can use your keycard to get discount at the shopping centre which isn't really made obvious.\n",

      "Can not fault the cleanliness of the room and the professionalism of the house-keeping team who are always an asset to any organisation.\n",
      "The lifts: too slow!!\n",
      "I agree with what sonebody else who wrote in their review that there should be guest only lifts.\n",
      "Lets face it, the infinity pool on the 57th floor is the main attraction and probably the main drawcard.\n",
      "I thoroughly enjoyed the adults only section of the pool so thank you very much to the lifeguards for keeping the pesky kids out of this small area of a large pool.\n",
      "Will i be\n",

      "We reached there at 8.30am and there hotel check-in tym was 3pm.\n",
      "After overnight journey we al wr too tired and the hotel front ofc staff was so helpful that they gv us a room and early chk in was done so at the same price we stayed dere more than a day and each and every staff's service is outstanding adding spl touch and making ur trip a memorable one.\n",
      "March 29, 2019.\n",
      "Wedding anniversary, 11 years, for my husband and I. Enquired with concierge to see if we were appropriately dressed (in cargo shorts, tee shirt and loafers) to go up to the 57th floor for a glass of champagne and to admire the view.\n",
      "Advised that a slightly more formal dress code is imposed, every evening, post 7pm.\n",
      "Lobby seemed crazy/manic.\n",
      "Some very pretentious persons trying to make themselves look big or important, at the expense of the really polite and hard working front of house and reception team.\n",
      "Don’t they realise how false and pathetic they make themselves look??\n",
      "The staff definitely had the upper hand and kept their cool.\n",
      "Got crammed into a lift heading for floor 57.\n",
      "Certain nationalities trying to shout and scream louder than the nationality next to\n",
      "I have not been particularly impressed by this hotel.\n",
      "Its biggest selling point is the view from the 57th floor, which is very impressive.  \n",
      "However, beyond that, I find it difficult to enthuse about it.\n",
      "It has over 2,500 rooms and this shows: the service is slow and impersonal.\n",
      "The dining facilities are frankly not able to cope with the sheer number of guests.\n",
      "There are queues for breakfast at 7.10 am.\n",
      "Further, the check in and concierge feel as if they are located in a busy shopping mall.\n",
      "Yet further, I am fed up with the lifts: every time I want to go up to my room, I have to compete with an army of tourists wanting to travel to the top.\n",
      "They really ought to have lifts for hotel guests only.\n",
      "My advice would be to stay at the Raffles and visit the MBS one evening for a\n",
      "I hag a great room but with disappointment the pool was full o screaming children, of noisy instagramers, of people who were not behaving properly!\n",
      "The Management should approve a strict code of behavior for clients, otherwise it is an amusement park , not a luxury Hotel.\n",
      "No one did the room night set.\n",
      "First of all, i was travelling with a backpack so i assumed there might be a little staring and a not so warm welcome as it had happened before in other luxury hotels when arriving with a backpack, but for my surprise it was everything else.\n",
      "Staff was very friendly and welcoming even though we didn't look like the average customer there.\n",
      "Got to check-in early, had a nice room from the 26th floor with a garden view.\n",
      "Floor was silent, not any noises from the corridor or other rooms.\n",

      "Room itself was very good and clean with comfortable beds and even more comfortable pillows and linens.\n",
      "Curtains and lights can be controlled from bed.\n",
      "This hotel is architecturally thrilling, designed by Moshe Safti - he did not disappoint!\n",
      "The view of the Bay is stunning, the horizon edge pool that floats between all three towers on the 57th floor is worth the price of admission.\n",
      "Ask for a room between the 8th floor and the 25th floor to maximize your viewing excitement.\n",
      " Rooms are gracious, food in their many restaurants is great.\n",
      "I recommend Spagos for breakfast (included in the American Plan) and whatever you do  . . .\n",
      "don't miss the 22 layer chocolate/Peanut butter cake in Lavo lounge near the pool.\n",
      "Be sure to take in the light show in the sculpture gardens and the water show in the harbor - both are free and spectacular.\n",
      "This was just plain FUN!\n",
      "For a luxury hotel, I was surprised that the beds were so hard.\n",
      "Also, the gym is very tiny for such a large hotel, so expect to wait for machines.\n",
      "Other than that, our stay was nice and the staff were very helpful.\n",
      "Wonderful hotel, everything that you would expect.\n",
      "The infinity pool gives amazing views over the harbour.\n",

      "We got a suite on the 52nd floor with an unforgettable view to the bay and the city.\n",
      "The suite was very large and comfortable, the staff was extremely friendly and attentive.\n",
      "Overall, there is nothing much that can beat a stay in this hotel.\n",
      "this is the go to hotel in Singapore apparently and everyone wants one of the iconic shots of themselves in the roof top pool.\n",
      "However this is a very large hotel with a huge number of guests and although the service is good do not expect five star service and if you want a decent room on a high floor it is worth paying for a club room.\n",
      "The pool is lovely but there are a lot of people enjoying it so it is not a place to go for splendid isolation.\n",
      "That being said the hotel is convenient for anything you might want and has an excellent choice of restaurants.\n",
      "Fantastic experience as expected from this iconic hotel.\n",
      "The infinity pool wasnt overcrowded when we were there, it was really a great experience.\n",

      "The spacious guest room commanded panoramic view of the sea.\n",
      "Here I really appreciate the craftsmanship of housekeeping who sculpted a rabbit from towels for display in guest rooms!\n",
      "Upon checking in, I enquired the front desk staff if I could still find a power cable that I left in my room a year before.\n",
      "I must appreciate the helpful staff in searching through their database, found my name, and checked their relevant department.\n",
      "Though I can’t retrieve it since lost and found items would be disposed of within a limited period of time, the caring attitude of their staff is to be applauded.\n",
      "At S$56 a head, the lunch buffet at Rise Restaurant in the Marina Bay Sands Hotel isn’t cheap, especially since it will go up to S$66 after the service charge and taxes.  \n",
      "However for that money, you do get a pretty wide variety of choices.\n",
      "For sashimi lovers, the large chunks of tuna and octopus will make the price seem less daunting.\n",
      "There are also stations dedicated to Indian and local Singaporean dishes.\n",
      "Unlike other hotels, the dessert spread is substantial, with a chocolate fountain and a make-your-own soda counter.\n",
      "I am impressed with the buffet here, which says a lot.\n",
      "Set under the wide expanse of the atrium glass of the hotel, a section of the restaurant will be bathed in light, a boon to sun worshippers.\n",
      "But for a photophobic local like me, I asked for a shaded\n",
      "Ours was a 3 star hotel experience and make no mistake this is a MASSIVE hotel with more rooms than the Vatican.\n",
      "Arrived at check in at 6pm having been dropped off by our taxi driver at the Tower 3 entrance.\n",
      "Walking through the glass doors there were so many people in the foyer it was difficult discerning where the check in counter was.\n",
      "Having eventually found it, we were presented with 11 clerks behind 5 terminals.\n",
      "Despite this overwhelming ratio of staff-guest it took a good 13 minutes for our clerk to check us in.\n",
      "This was because he was struggling in his own words '' to find you a room''.\n",
      "Now if checkout is 11 pm, and we have arrived at 6 pm , having made a booking a month prior, surely someone somewhere would've already allocated a room.\n",
      "The room that was\n",
      "Stayed over in the Premium room for the weekends with family.\n",
      "First of all, the lobby was really rowdy and likened “market place”.\n",
      "The room was more spacious than many 5-star hotels.\n",
      "However the basic amenities like toiletries were “cheap” looking.\n",
      "The way drinks in the fridge are secured gave occupants a feeling that they couldn’t be trusted.\n",
      "The bed was really comfortable but the pillows were too soft.\n",
      "Gym facility was well equipped and clean; the infinity pool was always busy and unpleasantly crowded.\n",
      "Food in and around the hotel are definitely pricey; can’t say the quality or variety (esp those restaurants at Level 1) were great.\n",
      "Marina Bay Sands is a true feat of a hotel and an attraction in and of itself.\n",
      " While it can be overwhelming and easy to feel anonymous, it is a great property.\n",
      "I opted to stay in a club room which was a good decision.\n",
      "Checking was in the Sands lounge rather than general check in.\n",
      "This was a pleasant space with small snacks and water (and you get to sit while waiting to check in).\n",
      "Also it provided access to Club55 in tower 2 which we used for afternoon tea and breakfast.\n",
      "  The room was large, clean and luxurious.\n",
      "The beds were comfortable and all of the soaps and lotions were from a luxury brand.\n",
      "We were lucky enough to be on the 53rd floor and had great views of Gardens by the Bay.\n",
      "The pool is one of the primary reasons to stay here.\n",
      "The hotel really restricts access to the\n",
      "Well, MBS is justifiably World-famouos as the Hotel with (currently) the World's longest rooftop disappearing-edge pool (3 x 50 meter pools linked end to end), and yes, the view from atop whilst sitting in reasonably warm water is VERY good indeed!\n",
      "As a hotel, MBS has an excellent reputation, and all rooms are very well appointed.\n",
      "Service is as you'd expect from an establishment that markets itself as \"Asia's best 5-star Hotel\", and the arcitecture is fantastic too.\n",
      "Excellent access everywhere, and a visit to MBS is incomplete without a trip around \"The Shoppes\" downstairs, the Gardens by the Bay (with their World-famous Supertrees), and a ride on the amazingly clean, graffiti-free and efficient Singapore Rapid Transit Subway system.\n",
      "One of the best 5-star hotels we've stayed\n",
      "I visited in March 2019 for a Friday/Saturday nights stay.\n",
      "The scale of the hotel is enormous, with a huge lobby (both in square footage and atrium volume).\n",
      "I was checked in efficiently despite a long queue for the check-in area.\n",
      "My room had been booked directly on the hotel's website for a low-floor king-bed room.\n",
      "The room was ready when I arrived at 5 PM, and the room exceeded my expectations as far as square footage and finishes.\n",
      "The room was also very quiet, despite being on the 6th floor off of the indoor lobby atrium.\n",
      "The scale of the hotel plus the pool and observation deck atop it reminded me of being in Las Vegas.\n",
      "The one comment I have about service is that it was attentive, but impersonal.\n",
      "I spent most time at the pool, which was lovely, if a bit crowded other than in\n",
      "I have to say our stay here was sadly disappointing and suppose to be the highlight of our 3 wk journey through Asia.\n",
      "The skypool is definitely worth a visit and lives up to the hype.\n",
      "However, our room was ok and fell a bit short for a 5 star hotel.\n",
      "Starting off with our first night our room made horrible loud banging noises throughout the night that kept us up.\n",
      "When we addressed to the staff even with a recording of it they dismissed as a nonissue.\n",
      "Only after we got maintenance up there did they move us rooms and still fully charged us for the first horrible night.\n",
      "As a hotel quite pricey they seem to treat our complaint as our problem not there's.\n",
      "Also beds are extremely hard and uncomfortable.\n",
      "As well as the Lavo restaurant is way too expensive for the quality of food\n",
      "We spent 3 nights here in an Orchid Suite with Club access after a cruise from Australia.\n",
      "This is a spectacular hotel as the photos show , an architectural wonder!\n",
      "Our room looked over the Gardens by the Bay.\n",
      "Be aware this is a huge Hotel There were always lots of people wandering around the foyer.\n",
      "It made the check in a little slow but not too bad.\n",
      "This was particularly an issue with the Club access on Friday and Saturday evenings access is from 5pm best not to be late or you face a longish wait.\n",
      "However the wait staff were lovely and seated us quickly whilst serving us champagne!\n",
      "A special mention to Leonard at Concirerge desk.\n",
      "He was great with directions to the gardens and the shops.\n",

      "The room facilities were excellent and the views of the Gardens on the Bay from the 47th floor were amazing.\n",
      "All the staff were extremely friendly and courteous, and nothing was too much trouble.\n",

      "Rene and Shven at the Club 55 restaurant provided exceptional and friendly service.\n",
      "In addition, all the staff at Spago restaurant, where we had our celebration\n",
      "Wonderful hotel, but no good costumer service, the rooms needs  modernize, clean,no customized services, no welcome, no nobody interested in helping you or at least show   you where is your room, you  pay really for access to the pool...\n",
      "I've been to other hotels much better.\n",
      "One of the best spot we've visited so far, we ride a boat trip and have a wonderful moment there, we also exploring the surrounding like garden by the bay, casino, the ferrari corner and window shopping, thank you MBS!!!\n",
      "Nice food but way too expensive for the price you pay to have local food.\n",
      "Mostly meant for tourists with all the high luxury boutiques.\n",
      "Nothing is really cheap here except if you go Zara or the shops selling sporting goods like Adidas and World of Sports.\n",
      "Mostly meant to target the well to do locals and people who feel they are part of a upper social type.\n",
      "Be prepared to pay anything from $12 to $18 for a plate of Nasi Padang\n",
      "This is the best hotel i visited.\n",
      "With a mall and a casino inside the hotel, restaurants and direct access to the marina bay, the gardens by the bay.\n",

      "I was looking over the shopping centre.\n",
      "This was a work trip so it didn’t matter, but I’d recommend upgrading if you are staying on holiday.\n",
      "Marina Bay Sands, you are FORMIDABLE, EXTRAORDINARY, and the true definition of Hospitality.\n",
      "We arrived in the morning and the check in is not supposed to be until the afternoon, but we still tried to ask one of your amazing people in the front to see if we were able to check in early and they said YES, especially after they found out that I was sick and I needed to rest after a two days trip.  \n",

      "This is the only hotel I stay at in Singapore and I\n",
      "Let’s be straight - the price you have to pay to stay at MBS is more than you will pay at most hotels and will certainly be in my lifetime.\n",
      "However MBS is worth every penny!!\n",
      "From the movement you arrive, the service is second to none, the hotel is thriving with activity and offers options to suit all tastes.\n",
      "We decided to pay for an Club room which made our stay even more enjoyable.\n",
      "The Club55 lounge is fantastic and really makes the money you spend worthwhile.\n",
      "We can’t remember any of the staff names however everyone was always welcoming and happy to help.\n",
      "The facilities at the hotel are world class, we took a trip to the casino which was seemless to enter and was a hive of activity inside.  \n",
      "It’s easy to get a taxi outside the hotel with the taxi stop having numerous cars\n",
      "We have had an amazing stay at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.\n",
      "From the minute we arrived to the minute we left we were treated as valued guests - and not a room number as I had thought possible before I arrived - as the Hotel and complex is so BIG!\n",
      "I could fault nothing - the staff were amazing, our room spotless and the view incredible, the Hotel is just Wow!\n",

      "Upon check-in, when the woman realized we were a family of 4, she casually mentioned how she upgraded us to a suite with 2 bedrooms (without me asking).\n",
      "I thanked her and proceeded to our room.\n",
      "For the price of 2 deluxe rooms, we ended up with a Straits Suite on the 54th floor!  \n",
      "No idea what we did as a family to deserve this, but we may never experience this level of luxury again.  \n",
      "Baby grand piano, karaoke room, the list goes on and on.\n",
      "Over 5 times bigger in area than those 2 original rooms combined, and an even bigger upgrade in terms of room rate.\n",
      "As for everything else you'd expect in a major luxury hotel, MBS has it!\n",

      "The concierge's desk directed us to an office behind the main registration desk of Tower 1.\n",
      "  We met with a VIP representative who offered us refreshments, had our luggage stored and told us they would contact us via e-mail when our room was ready.\n",
      "A little after noon we were in our corner 17th floor suite, which had a garden main view and a partial city view from the bathroom.\n",
      "The suite was enormous, with an equally large bathroom.\n",
      "One of the benefits of booking a suite was Club 55, which provided breakfast, afternoon high tea at 2:00 and happy hour from 5-7.  \n",
      "We utilized all of these and having come from two week of non-stop dining, really didn't\n",

      "Plenty of dining options.\n",
      "Negative - 1)\n",

      "Best time to access are 6-8am or after 8pm\n",
      "Overall it was a pleasant memorable stay.\n",
      "Avoid peak holiday season if you want enjoy the experience on one of world's best roof top\n",
      "The Marina Bay Sands has the crown jewel, in terms of pools, in Singapore, and maybe in the world.\n",
      "Of course, everyone is blown away by the pool - especially right after a 17hour flight from San Francisco!\n",
      "However, the excitement starts to fizzle pretty quickly from there.\n",
      "The lengthy waits for the elevators, the million and ten tourists, it is generally far from everything except Gardens by the Bay, oh, and the uncomfortable beds.\n",
      "Service also was pretty lackluster - a 45+ min wait for drinks at the pool... then they delivered the wrong drinks, then charged me.\n",
      "  I would recommend that people go for the experience, leave after the first few days.\n",
      "Would not recommend a lengthy stay.\n",
      "We booked a room (just standard double deluxe) 2 days before our trip.\n",
      "I’ve searched from site to site and all are expensive.\n",
      "(ofcourse given the time frame)\n",
      "I suggest you book at their main site.\n",
      "You can get discounts there and who knows you’ll be lucky enough to get the cheapest room yet.\n",
      "How to get there:\n",
      "By cab/grab : expensive probably 8-15sgd  By train: 👌🏻 (Better get the tourist pass-\n",
      "you can use it in mrt/lrt/bus)\n",

      "Check in is at 3pm.\n",
      "Be there early!\n",
      "Skip the long queues.\n",
      " While waiting for your room to be ready, you can stroll Around their mall.\n",

      "Everything about the stay was brilliant\n",
      "and we both really enjoyed it\n",
      "Well done to all the staff who were all so friendly\n",
      "The Hotel is spectacular, the structure unparalleled, but it is also most likely in the top 3 of visited Tourist attractions in Singapore and it seems everyone in SG is on the roof top.\n",
      "So, if you enjoy standing in line for your US$18 drink, can’t get a seat/table or love 30 minute elevator rides/waits, this is your place.\n",
      "I would have rated this 2 Star if it wasn’t for the staff from the gift shop who courierd a gift to me, I forgot to buy.\n",
      "If you book direct with them and pay the higher rate over the “booking.com(s)” you are promised lots of “cash”.\n",
      "Don’t believe it!!!!\n",
      "You are merely given discounts in their ridiculously priced restaurants and casino dollars, all 30 of them!\n",
      "3 nights was way too long and for that money you can stay at better hotels.\n",
      "Finally, I was\n",
      "22 hours in Singapore.\n",

      "Walking easy to the Gardens by the Bay (beyond beautiful and a cool break from my tropical sweating...)\n",
      "Received exactly what we booked, good sized room, good amenities, just not as practical as it should be.\n",
      "Bed is rock hard.\n",
      "Pillows are very good, but the bed kills your back.  \n",
      "You are a number only at this hotel, it is a great engineering feat but lags badly in being a warm feeling luxury hotel.\n",
      "We booked to use the club lounge and this was warmly met by the staff who were very nice and remembered us after a few visits.\n",
      "The club is large but it needs to be as many guests have access.\n",
      "It has no feeling of exclusiveness, once full it has the feeling of a cheap cafeteria.\n",
      "There are kids everywhere, no control with them, food on the floor and not cleaned up after they left.\n",
      "This was at multiple tables.\n",
      "Evening drinks should be drinks and\n",

      "These people are so wonderful and very friendly.\n",
      "We will definitely stay again at MBS next time we travel to Singapore.\n",
      "Almost forgot, the view while you're on the pool on 57th floor is nothing short of spectacular, especially at night.\n",
      "Make sure you give yourself time to relax on the pool- you'll be amazed.\n",
      "You will run out of selfie poses.\n",
      "We had one of the best rooms with great view overlooking river.\n",
      "Unfortunately the room itself is a little outdated.\n",
      "You don’t feel specialty even with upgrades.\n",
      "The only amazing thing is infinity pool and you pay mainly for this .\n",
      "In general hotel is overpriced.\n",
      "Service is not helpful.\n",

      "Good shower, firm bed and good air-conditioning.\n",
      "  Infinity pool is a must...amazing views, albeit very busy as expected with no shade.\n",
      "Cocktails at Spago Bar S$26 each, however very well made.\n",
      "Recommend the skydeck.\n",
      "Room service ordered the night before for breakfast delivered on a table exactly on time and perfectly cooked.\n",
      "Definitely worth the extra cost to stay at such an iconic location.\n",
      "The only negative I could see is that\n",
      "Stayed here during the formula 1....absolutely loved the pool...\n",
      "the pool can be busy but there is always some place where you can sit down... when they saw we were with a little kid they arranged an early check inn with Some extra pay....\n",
      "that was great....\n",
      "the hotel for sure is expensive but its definately worth it.\n",
      "The good: - amazing pool and also the rest of the skypark is great  - Nice room with a great view - great atmosphere...its really alive - check inn and check out proces.\n",
      "What can be better: - I missed the old bathroom amenities.\n",
      "The new merk was less good.\n",
      "- it took considerable time before the amount quaranteed via my creditcard was finally settled.\n",
      "- its expensive.\n",
      "Our third stay and we will never tire of the marvellous rooftop pool and views.\n",
      "Pricey but worth it.\n",
      "Poolside snacks were very good value.\n",

      "Plenty opportunity to admire the city view from the rooftop.\n",
      "My wife and I went for 5 nights to Singapore.\n",
      "As we didn't get reservations for 1 of the 5 nights at Marina Bay Sands (where we spent the balance 4 nights), we stayed at the nearby Marina Mandarin.\n",
      "Our conclusion after the 5-day trip was that the Marina Mandarin was BETTER than Marina Bay Sands on all counts, except the choice of restaurants/bars at the latter.\n",
      "The Concierge Desk is not able to get reservations at in-hotel restaurants for hotel guests.\n",
      "Waiting for Taxis is too long.\n",
      "The crowd at the Lobby is too large for a Luxury Hotel.\n",
      "I stayed at this hotel for 1 night with my boyfriend on our stop over to Australia from the UK.\n",
      "This hotel has been on my bucket list since the moment I saw it and it did not disappoint.\n",
      "Yes the hotel is not the cheapest to stay at\n",
      "but I promise its worth every penny spent and is good value for money.\n",
      "You really do get what you pay for with this hotel <3\n",
      "Few tips I picked up along the way...   *\n",
      "* before you check in you need to check with some of the staff hovering by the check in queues which tower you are staying in.\n",
      "Each tower has its own check in desk and you don't want to queue in the wrong one\n",
      "** we booked the \"standar\" room to keep the cost down and I use the term standard loosely.\n",
      "The rooms are huge, the bed is huge, the shower is huge.\n",
      "There was a sofa and very nice\n",
      "It’s clearly the most iconic hotel in Singapore but after staying there for two nights in a Club Room, it’s way overrated and overpriced - and thus the rating here at 2 stars.\n",
      "It was a nice room - but nice in terms of a mid range hotel brand nice.\n",
      "It’s also just a massive complex that there is no sense of personalisation and you are truly just a number at this hotel.\n",
      "There is also very little public areas to congregate, sit or wait in the lobby.\n",
      "It does have great views of the gardens and is convenient if you plan to just shop and gamble.\n",
      "The pool was nice but again was underwhelming and rather crowded.\n",
      "I’d recommend a stay some place else and swing by for a drink on the rooftop at one of their bars.\n",
      "Rested with my husband in Singapore in the Marina Bay Sands hotel from 22-24.02.2019 in the Orchid Suite City View room on the 53rd floor, the view from the window over the city was amazing, in the evenings you can watch a laser show without leaving the room, on the roof of the hotel the 57th floor has a swimming pool and SkyPark, a viewing platform where you can enjoy the view of the city and take great photos, near the gardens and a huge shopping center, there is a museum and a casino.\n",
      "The place is simply amazing and it takes more time to visit all places than we were and not only therefore.\n",
      "To swim and relax at the pool on, it was necessary to take places in advance, before breakfast.\n",
      "At breakfast, too, we had to wait in the queue for 20-30 minutes when the omelet was fried,\n",
      "The reason I gave this title was because these big flash iconic hotels leave me cold.\n",
      "One night here cost £100 more than a week in Bali and that included breakfast, whereas this place didn't.\n",
      "But this isn't just about the hotel, it's a lot of Singapore I felt, very impersonal and not very friendly.\n",
      "You have to wait in a fairly long queue to check in\n",
      "but once you do the staff are very helpful but because my cards were on a security lock whilst I was abroad they locked the mini bar, so we couldn't even put the complimentary waters or anything else in there.\n",
      "The rooms are huge with a great view across the bay and with every facility you could want but with what you are paying so you should have.\n",
      "We didn't eat at the hotel because value for money it is not, it's more of an experience\n",
      "Had a slightly tired room on 47th floor with club 55 access for a couple of nights.\n",
      "People must come for pool photos as it was very busy and not at all relaxing.\n",
      "The same comments apply for the club 55 lounge.\n",
      "Massive hotel so you can't expect quiet.\n",
      "Obviously great views\n",
      "but I easily prefered Ritz Carlton opposite.\n",
      "We stayed in the straits suite for one night and it was over the top.\n",
      "We had a karaoke room, small gym, two bedrooms with one queen bed and two king beds and one of the bedrooms had a big bath, small kitchen corner, huge living room with a piano, dining table and sofas.\n",
      "The room was on the 52th floor and the view was amazing ofcourse, especially at night.\n",
      "Really loved the infinity pool on the roof, it was extremely cool and not frightening at all.\n",
      "Great room, view, infinity pool, breakfast, ... we loved it all!\n",
      "Yes it is expensive, but it is worth the money for a one time experience :-)\n",
      "We had a Club room in Tower 2 level 49 and the view from the room was great!\n",
      "We were lucky to even watch the fireworks from our huge room window.\n",
      "We also went to the light show at Supertree Gardens by the Bay which was amazing, and the Hotel gave a perfect \"background\" due to its spectacular architecture!\n",
      "One of the most iconic hotels in the world, boasting of the worlds largest infinity pool.\n",
      "The hotel consists of innumerable restaurants but however are pretty full so a reservation might be required.\n",
      "The view is mind boggling\n",
      "Stayed here for one night in a Premiere room.\n",
      "The room was nice; very clean, comfortable and spacious with a beautiful City view on the 31st floor of he 2nd tower.\n",
      "We visited the Sky Park/infinity pool and it was incredible.\n",
      "We went for a swim and enjoyed cocktails poolside.\n",
      "The views were incredible and the pool was amazing.\n",
      "As a hotel guest we had free access to these facilities.\n",
      "Others who are not staying at the hotel can't have access to the pool, but can have access to the bars and restaurants at the pool level for 22 SGD.\n",
      "While at the hotel we also visited the gardens and mall that was adjacent to the hotel.\n",
      "We also ate at two of the restaurants --Rise and Blossom.\n",
      "The buffet at RISE was amazing.\n",
      "The staff at this hotel were wonderful.\n",
      "I would definitely stay\n",
      "Came here 2 years ago and was blown away by the view and welcoming from bar staff .we bought a bottle of fizz\n",
      "and they were attentive to our needs .this year a very different story you need to aquire a $22 pass to get up their which comes off a drink ,you couldn't get near the edge to take photos as each table had a bottle of vodka on at £170 which gave you the right to stay as long as you wished .seems\n",
      "this is now a place only for the rich and the staff made it clear ,very rude and not a pleasant experience .For\n",
      "a lovely hotel lots of people walking around in dressing gowns (very strange) .last time for us ...\n",
      "Feedback following a recent two night stay in a twin room in a low room on Tower 1.\n",
      "The room was nice; very clean, comfortable and spacious.\n",
      "However due to the large size of the hotel (which feels more like a conference center) and it’s design, our room was overlooking the reception counter / lobby area at the very front of the building and didn’t feel very private.\n",
      "In saying that, I was surprised that the room was quiet and we didn’t hear much noise from the lobby.\n",
      "However the main reason one would stay here is for the Sky Park/infinity pool and I was overly impressed with this, and would stay again purely to access these facilities.\n",
      "Due to the size of the pool and number of restaurants, there was always sufficient space and room to sit.\n",
      "Recently stayed in a Club Room in the Marina Bay Sands well worth upgrading!\n",
      "The Club55 breakfast, afternoon tea and evening beverages and canapés were all outstanding.  \n",
      "The service in Club55 was excellent from the start of service to the end.\n",
      "The room was nicely appointed with fabulous view of the gardens.\n",
      "The infinity pool is amazing although very busy best to be up early to experience it fully.\n",
      "Loved my stay at the Marina Bay Sands can’t wait to return!\n",
      "We decided to visit the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel from the Hop on Hop off bus.\n",
      "It cost 22 Singapore dollars and we got a drink in at the bar on the top of this fantastic Hotel.\n",
      "It was marvelous, the views the ambience, being able to see the Infinity pool (but not go in or around it) was such a great experience.\n",
      "Will never forget.\n",
      "The hotel is conveniently located near most of the major tourist attractions, so you don't have to travel far if you are only in the city for a couple days.\n",
      "The rooms had very updated amenities (ie. automatic curtains) and were definitely above-average for hotel rooms.\n",
      "The pool of course had the amazing infinity pool, however the rooftop lacked any seats with shade near the pool.\n",
      "It would be nice if there were some umbrella to cover some of the chairs, because being up there without any protection from the sun is a little overwhelming.\n",
      "The pool does have a blocked off section for adults-only which is nice if you are travelling without children.\n",
      "I stayed here for 3 nights and probably wouldn't consider booking here again.\n",
      "There's a bit of 'been there done that' mentality.\n",
      "I was intrigued by the overall hype of the hotel and thought I'd give it a shot, over my usual stays in Singapore.\n",
      "Beyond the actual room itself, I don't think there's anything special about the hotel.\n",
      "Pros:  - The room was new and clean.\n",
      "I really liked how there were outlets everywhere, including USB ports.\n",
      "Definitely very helpful.\n",
      "It's convenient, plenty of public transport option -\n",
      "Obviously, it's central to Gardens by the Bay, which is a huge plus.\n",
      "Cons (unfortunately it's a long list)  - Check-in was very slow.\n",
      "I arrived on 8:45pm on a Tuesday night, and there were only 2 people at Check-in with a line of about 10 guests.\n",
      "With such a big\n",
      "Stayed here as we met relatives there for a reunion.\n",
      "Thought we’d treat ourselves as we had heard the hype about this place.\n",
      "This place was an absolute nightmare.\n",
      "Booked on their website for a family of four.\n",
      "Arrived to find essentials 2 tiny double beds for 4 people.\n",
      "My husband spoke to reception about the fact that it was not suitable for 4 people, even though the website recommended it for 4 people.\n",
      "They eventually agreed to bring up a fold out bed.\n",
      "But it took hours and multiple requests for it to arrive.\n",
      "The famous pool up top was absolutely freezing!\n",
      "I didn’t swim in it once!\n",
      "One is the spas was closed too.\n",
      "So the one tiny spa that was there held about 10 bodies in essentially an over sized bath tub.\n",
      "It was so gross.\n",
      "There was nothing to do here for families.\n",
      "Provided we got the cheapest room at only $500 a night...\n",
      "it was just your run of the mill standard, nice motel room.\n",
      "Our balcony was genuinely about 20cms wide but was still nice to have a breeze.\n",
      "But let’s get to the reason we chose to stay here...THAT pool.\n",

      "There were multiple choke points around the property, most noticeably at the elevators, where you'd sometimes wait for multiple full elevators to go by.\n",
      "Or, wait times in general and massive cattle herding.\n",
      "For the price, this was a let down.\n",
      "The room was fantastic, however we found little annoyances - the TV remote did not work, the window shade motor bugged out every time we activated the room power, and the mandarins they gave us has big mold spots.\n",
      "So, not perfect.  \n",
      "The Club 55 staff are superb - so personable.\n",

      "That’s where it ends.\n",
      "1.The lobby is like a market place - noisy and crowded.\n",
      "There is nowhere to sit and relax eg while waiting for someone.\n",
      "2.The check in and check out is atrocious- service is absolutely slow and understaffed.\n",
      "For a hotel of this reputation and standard I do not expect to be standing in line to check in for over 20 minutes.\n",
      "The room is a standard size hotel room and is nothing special.\n",
      "For the cheapest room here we paid over £360 for 1 night!\n",
      "We have stayed in much better hotels in Singapore for a lot less than half that!\n",
      "Even though this is the biggest tourist destination in Singapore, the service level is high, the options for eating, drinking and shopping endless, and of course the rooftop pool is one the coolest in the world.\n",
      "Had a wonderful stopover at the Marina Bay.\n",
      "The room was beautiful, with an incredible view (we'd been upgraded from the ground floor, which was lovely).\n",
      "The staff were amazing.\n",
      "The rooftop pool has a brilliant city view - it's a bit of a selfie-soup, so don't expect to actually be able to swim properly, but the view is stunning.\n",
      "The poolside restaurant did amazing breakfasts and good cocktails (we didn't try any of the other food there).\n",
      "Everything is ridiculously well organised and particularly liked that when you check out you can use the gym, spa and shower all day, so if you have an evening flight can leave your bags, enjoy the day then come and freshen up.\n",
      "Singapore in general was a bit of a surprise.\n",
      "We saw it as a stopover and I'd always imagined it to be a bit\n",
      "A beautiful view from the bar and pool area with an almost 360 degree view of Singapore, the pool is for guests only.\n",
      "Drinks very very expensive.\n",
      "There is not much shade and extremely hot and not much seating but well worth a look\n",
      "I’ve been to MBS several times already but only doing the review now maybe because I get used to the hotel already but our last stay this Feb was a superb staycation.\n",
      "Love the grand club room, plus the high tea, the cocktails and breakfast at club 55.\n",
      "(Will do a separate review at club 55).\n",
      "The hotel as usual is crowded at the lobby, specially the check in and out counter hope they can do something about this.\n",
      "Good thing club rooms can check in at VIP check in counter.\n",

      "Access to the Gardens By The Bay, the shopping mall and the Art/Science Museum was easy.\n",
      "Service everywhere was excellent, cheerful staff were happy to help with everything thing.\n",
      "Our only disappointment was dinner at Lavo, an Italian/American themed restaurant, the service was so quick our meal was served immediately we had ordered which suggested that it was very much prepared, certainly not by a chef and it was very expensive.\n",
      "We were in\n",
      "Marina Bay sands is a luxurious mall that has cozy cafes/Restaurants to chill.\n",
      "Besides that, not everything in marina bay sands is neither expensive, however there is also certain shops that sells affordable items that fullfill your own personal needs!\n",
      "So don’t forget to visit MBS, Singapore!\n",
      "Its been a few years since my last visit at MBS, but seems like nothing has changed, it just got even better.\n",
      "The view from our balcony is awesome facing the garden.\n",

      "Its bustling night and day and  if tranquility is what you're after this might not be the place for you.\n",
      "I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Marina Bay Sands,  \n",
      "We had a package which allowed us private check-in.\n",
      "This alone, made it worth it after a 15 or 16 hour flight. .\n",
      "We had our choice of breakfast at 3 or 4 different places - we tried a different one every day.\n",
      "We also had exclusive access to a Club room which we utilized a few times, but not every day.\n",
      "Our suite was nice but not luxurious.\n",
      "More like a business class hotel.\n",
      "The bathroom was VERY nice.\n",
      "Big, dual sinks, enormous walk-in shower and\n",
      "We totally splurged to be able to say we stayed here.\n",

      "Love to come back here in future\n",
      "We decided to stay in that hotel because of infinity pool.\n",
      "But the true is that is a massive hotel with to much people:( the rooms are ok, but not so special for the price.\n",
      "The pool - to many people making photos.\n",
      "For sure it is not a place for holiday.\n",
      "Just to go for swimingpool for 20 minutes and make pictures.\n",
      "The hotel is also not so new.\n",
      "But we have to be there to have our own opinion.\n",
      "We came to Marina Bay Sands with high expectations.\n",
      "Overall it was not a pleasant visit.\n",

      "We tried to get into the Ce La Vi club on the upper level and was told that tickets were sold out.\n",
      "The doorman was extremely rude!\n",
      "We chose to go elsewhere and found out on the ground floor that tickets were being sold for the club entry!\n",
      "We came, we saw we thought “ho hum”.\n",
      "We have been in Singapore for two weeks and have looked over the bay several times thinking gotta do that.\n",
      "Now we are here not so much.\n",
      "If you are going to lay down $650 US for a room here be prepared for a sub standard experience.\n",
      "Room are nice but small for the $.\n",
      "Yes the pool is great and the view 5 star, its the screaming kids and parents that spoil the show.\n",
      "And the selfie gang, don’t get me started.\n",
      "So if we had to do over, spend a couple of hundred less on different 5 star hotel, or if your determined to spend the $650 per night, you can rent a whole sweet at say the inter continental hotel and get the service that should come with that price point.\n",
      "Oh and no breakfast that’s extra, also instant coffee in the room, really folks no\n",

      "It would have been lovely to spend some time up there\n",
      "but as we only had half an hour allocated by the tour company and the queue for the lift back down  was 20 minutes then we only had time to take a few pictures before our decent .\n",
      " Fabulous views, recommend you allow plenty of time and do this venue independently.\n",

      "I felt like this hotel was a must do, although mega pricey!\n",
      "We arrived around 10am and started to queue for check-in, it was very busy and quite slow like many of the reviews on here have said.\n",
      "The staff definitely seemed aware of this though\n",
      "and we were taken through to the VIP check-in to speed things along.\n",
      "As check in isn't until 3pm we were told our room wasn't ready but we were given temporary key cards to be able to access the pool area and we told we would be emailed when our room was ready.\n",
      "This was fine for us as our plan was to get out ASAP to see the city.\n",

      "We came back down quite quickly .\n",

      "Has a huge shopping complex with world's best brands.\n",
      "Don't forget to visit the light show in bay behind the hotel building at night.\n",
      "Such a pity because I enjoyed the hotel rooms and all the surrounding amenities, but the treatment we received from the pool and security staff put a huge stain on our whole experience at the Marina Bay Sands.\n",
      "IMO, if a person pays extra $$ to get 2x nicer rooms for 5 star luxury (as promised), then maybe the hotel should invest in training their staff to provide 5 star customer service or at least teach them reasonable dispute resolution skills.\n",
      "Upon check-in (with a family of 5 AND 2 elderly grand parents) we were advised that our 2x booked rooms could not be adjoined and that only one room was available to us, forcing a 2 hr wait for the 2nd room to open up.\n",
      "That was not a problem for us as we understood how busy MBS was at the time, so we happily accepted their offer of\n",
      "We arrived at 9am after a 10 hour flight, I expected to checkin in the afternoon as most hotels do, we only waited 30 minutes to get our room, which was spectacular!\n",

      "I would definitely stay here again!\n",

      "Yes but you do get your money's worth.\n",
      "A dip in the Infinity pool is a must\n",
      "but I have to say it is quite crowded.\n",
      "The dining offerings are spread out all over the place which is a bit of a draw back but our breakfasts at Bread Street (Gordon Ramsey) were the highlight.\n",
      "While this hotel is quite pricey, everyone who pays a visit to Singapore needs to stay in this hotel at least once.\n",
      "The pool is one of it's highlights and definitely lives up to its reputation.\n",
      "A beautiful way to spend the afternoon overlooking the Singapore skyline and enjoying the amenities and blissfulness of the pool area.\n",
      "The main criticism is the menu in the pool area needs a lot of improvement, and while you expect a place like this to be overpriced, the prices really were over the top for what you get, and the service was below average.\n",
      "The breakfast next to the pool area was another highlight however, great selection of foods to please almost anyone, with a pleasant ambience to start the day.\n",
      "We stayed in one of the suites which was very spacious and comfortable with\n",
      "Marina Bay Sands was an epitome of modern architecture in Singapore A showcase indeed!\n",
      "Amenities were just beyond your reach!\n",
      "From world class restaurants, casinos,close by shops and tourist attraction spots!\n",
      "All in one area!\n",
      "And when you are tired with all the activities you can use the pool with a view of the ciity and just relax along the pool sipping  your Singapore Sling drink in your hand!\n",
      "This is it for a total vacation!\n",

      "Expensive, but worth a couple night's stay to enjoy the pool and views from the rooftop.\n",
      "We had breakfast at SPAGO, although the food was good, there wasn't much variety for vegetarians.\n",
      "   Staff is friendly, as you would expect from a hotel of this caliber.\n",
      "The check-in process took a bit of time as there was a long queue, they made up for it by upgrading our room for free and allowing us to check in early.\n",
      "Definitely take a walk around the hotel outside, it looks quite nice from all angles, especially from Gardens by the Bay.\n",
      "The train station is right across the street so location is very convenient.\n",
      "But most places within the city center are walkable.\n",
      "The Marina Bay Sands hotel is a fantastic place to stay in Singapore.\n",
      "It's located at the centre of the city, 5 minutes taxi ride from the cruise terminal.\n",

      "We decided to splurge for a one day stay at this hotel post-cruise.\n",
      "We arrived at 9 AM and our requested room type (Grand Club) was not ready but we were given a pass to use the pool area and were told that we would get an email when the room was ready.\n",
      "No problem because we were heading off to meet up with friends to explore the city so we checked our luggage.\n",

      "I doubt Iâ€™ll return, especially considering the cost.\n",
      "The hotel is OK, room size is big, room service is very expensive, swimming pool is overrated too many people and swimming pool is so long, also if you bring kids you canâ€™t really swim in whole area so the swimming pool is restricted here and there, only plus is the location, location is really nice, close to art science museum above mall and walking distance to some nicest place in singapore, but if you are after the view or the swimming pool is not really worth it, there are many hotels near by with some view with cheaper price, this hotel worth to stay one time though, but not sure if i want to come back.\n",
      "apart from the design and the rooftop this is just like any other 5 star hotel.\n",
      "Maybe the rooftop pool access justifies the higher price?\n",
      "The rooms are fine, although nothing special.\n",

      "The naive clearly get caught up with the marketing hype and my family was no less a culprit.\n",
      "Rooms we had faced the Gardens by the Bay so perfectly lovely views.\n",
      "The hotel plys the room with lots of small disposable items as usual ..shampoo soap etc but not very environmentally aware or friendly which in this age is inexcusable for such a supposedly high end 5 star hotel.\n",
      "To get to the gym or pool we had to go down across the lobby and then back up a different elevator..not great design.\n",
      "All the restaurants are high end and have star chefs including Wolfgang Puck who for those not followers of that world, is a US based \"celebrity chef\".\n",

      "From the outset, there were mixed feelings about the whole experience, the bell boys on arrival are so rushed and over worked that we had to drag our bags to to check in after 16 hours of flying and arriving into 35 degree soaring heat, the check in experience itself is hectic and feels like you are at an airport and results in reaching the counter and the usual form filling (I don't know why in this day and age we still do this, why can this not be done in advance - especially at a 'top hotel').\n",
      "Once the room was allocated things did improve, the room was pleasant but again without being anything special it had everything you'd expect but nothing wowed.\n",

      "A side note on the coffee, MBS had those instant coffee packs (see photo) and a hot pot.\n",

      "At least if you prefer\n",

      "I have to be honest: this is not a luxury property though price per night might make you think it is.\n",

      "Check in was a 3pm\n",
      "but we arrived around 12 and they found us a room on the 25th floor as we had requested a room on the gardens buy the bay side, there are more expensive rooms on higher floor but this room was in our budget this time.\n",
      "All the staff are so professional with dealing with the guests and nothing is a problem, we were staying in tower 3 and what I liked was the security guard at the lift entrance checking room keys (stops non guests accessing the accommodation floors)\n",
      "Our room had\n",
      "It might be a bit overpriced but it is also an experience.\n",
      "If you can afford it (even for a night) you should do it.\n",
      "At least because it gives you access to this massive Infinity Pool at the top which is also an experience to do once (even if it is very crowded even at 8.30AM)\n",
      "Room was great also, but I would have expected a little bit better for the price (like a real balcony).\n",

      "I was not disappointed and hope to return for the Singapore Gran Prix sometime soon ðŸ˜Š\n",
      "Stayed here with family in June, and had a nice stay.\n",
      "The hotel is large, consisting of three towers with over 40 floors in each, so the number of guests is very high.\n",
      "Most of the facilities have been designed for these numbers, so things worked mostly OK.\n",
      "This is a nice luxury hotel, but most of the (very high) price of stay is for the infinity polls on the roof of the hotel, and the views to Singapore and views/access to the Marina Bay gardens.\n",
      "For those things one could pay that money (once), but for other (or longer) stays there are better luxury options in Singapore, and for (far?) less money.\n",

      "We were still out of pocket $70!\n",
      "You can view the pool from the bar and be tantalised by the fact you canâ€™t enter.\n",
      "We did not pay extra for the viewing platform and am not unhappy we didnâ€™t!\n",

      "i think its not very worth unless your budget is high.\n",
      "I stayed at the hotel recently.\n",
      "The rooms were nice a big however our bags were delivered to the room late, someone came in the room to check if the mini bar was stocked instead of doing this prior to our arrival and there were a few finishing issues particularly with the hotel guest internet service not working and the air con controls in the room not responding...not to mention the check in being inefficient.\n",
      "It's a good hotel don't get me wrong\n",
      "but it is a long way off for being classed as an elite hotel of the world, especially for the money you pay...worth it for the swimming pool....\n",

      "I guess everything has been said in the earlier reviews already.\n",

      "My one complaint though is the buffets.\n",
      "There are 3 which is awesome but I wish there were more selections.\n",
      "The international buffet was not what I was expecting, I was let down.\n",
      "I was expecting more selections like breakfast sandwiches (maybe Iâ€™m just homesick and looking for American breakfast foods).\n",
