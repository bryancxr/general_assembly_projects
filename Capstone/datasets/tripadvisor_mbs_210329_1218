The pool is an infinity pool at the top of the hotel offering views of the entire city below. You can relax at the pool while enjoying a drink or food served by very friendly hotel staff.

The sky line view towards the financial district is very special, but maybe a matter of taste, as surely someone may challenge this and prefer views towards the gardens.  It is a typical convention centre hotel, and feels, and is very large. One gets a bit of a feeling of living on an airport, which is not bad, but less relaxed. Bring a compass and good shoes for walking.

The room was very clean and so was the bathroom which was comfortable. The room was good enough to enjoy the view and spend the evenings. The amazing pool was an incredible experience of its own. Swimming high above the city (57th floor) was fantastic, but, as one can imagine a bit crowded at all times. Nonetheless, well worth it.

I know this is Asia... but came on! Separate SPA?! The second frustrating thing was the noisy air conditioner in the room. Even on the lowest fan setting kept me from fall asleep. The next disappointing fact is there is no a decent place for smoking cigars - no ware. No cigar bar, nothing! No smoking area around the pool, no smoking inside. Nothing dedicated for the purpose.

We realised we had made a mistake right from the outset. After spending an hour and a half in line to check in (we were not the only ones who experienced this delay). We had modified our booking two months prior to arriving. Despite this we found we had been charged for the night which had been cancelled. This meant another hour at the reception desk trying to get our money refunded which they told us would take 3-4 weeks!!

Because it's really really difficult to justify the price of the rooms to what you actually get compared to other hotels of similar standing but offering lower rates. Is the high price because of the infinity pool? I'm sorry to say that this pool is over-hyped, what you see are tourists who are there more to take pictures than to swim. Guests were not required to shower first before entering the pool (yuk!!) because no outdoor shower facilities can be found. To make matters worse, when I searched for a shower stall, we found only 1 next to 3 toilet stalls. When I asked a staff about this problem, we were told that the policy of hotel is to let the guests shower in their own rooms. I found this strange because to have a 5",6.0,2016-01-01

From the start when I was emailing to ensure that my booking and room were amazing, everything went smoothly and better than expected... Words cannot describe how it feels to stay in such a beautiful and luxurious hotel, the lobby, hotel lifts, and the rooms themselves are just astonishing and fit for anyone who has high standards. Considering the amount of rooms and guests, each staff member goes out of their way to make sure you feel loved and cared for, remembering your names at the club 55 at breakfast and afternoon tea, what coffee and food we liked, everyone deserves recognition for the individual and outstanding service displayed.  As it was a special occasion",10.0,2016-10-01
444847452,mbs,tripadvisor,2016-12-01,Philippines,Great experience,"We stayed overnight at MBS and we were truly satisfied with our experience. The deluxe room was very spacious, contrary to the other reviews that I read. The pool area was very crowded but the spectacular view (especially at night) compensated for it. With the pool experience alone I think we already got our money's worth. The express checkout is also cery convenient. Downside is there is no breakfast included in the room rate, which is a bummer considering the price we paid. Will stay again if we return to singapore. ",10.0,2016-12-01
444844307,mbs,tripadvisor,2016-12-01,Australia,"Stay for the pool, not the hotel","For price you pay for a place like this, it really does skimp on things. Everything about this hotel feels like they are just trying to get that little bit more out of you. From the placement of shops to the mini bar.   Arriving at the hotel, you're greeted with a large array of shops right in the centre of the lobby, with people just travelling through to shop and guest clustered into a fairly narrow strip. Service feels very impersonal but that's probably due to how busy the place usual is throughout the day and night. We had to run around a bit to find a bellboy to take our luggage. Depending on where you enter, check-in could be on the other side of the 400m long building.   The room itself is clean and quite nicely presented. Nothing spectacularly but it's well furnished.",6.0,2016-12-01

The room itself is a great size and very nicely setup but simple. Room was located in tower 1 overlooking the bay at eye height to the Super Trees on level 7. The Club room comes with a list of inclusions of which we found access to Club 55 (level 55) to be a superb option as a dinner replacement and for breakfast. Both consisting of self serve buffet style and included drinks. The food, an amazing variety of options, lot in convenient taste sizes, were all of high quality and delicious flavor.

444751056,mbs,tripadvisor,2016-12-01,Philippines,Very Good.  Some Annoyances ,Stayed for 4 nights.  City view suite in Tower 3 on the 51st floor.   The room is nice.  Never informed I had the option of a butler service.   Only realised this was included when a survey arrived after check out!!!!!  The hotel is very busy and expect long lines at peak times.     The evening canapés are nice but really when they start at 5pm it makes it hard to enjoy for those have to actually work first!  Maybe consider if starting at 6pm or if 5pm is locked in extend it for another hour until 8pm.    Room service was quick and quite tasty.  Housekeeping is good.    There was work on the floor and power was cut for a number of hours one morning.  No advance warning provided.   No indication provided that a problem may occur.

As you'd expect, the first impression of the lobby is indeed vast and busy, but you can enjoy peace and quiet as soon as you go up the lifts. Furthermore, the service from all the staff I interacted with was personable and top notch, which was very impressive from a hotel this size - requests for item deliveries and room service were infinitely quicker than much smaller hotels!  The rooms are well designed and modern although arguably starting to show some wear and tear. The bathrooms are a standout and come equipped with designer amenities and more goodies than most top hotels including extra",10.0,2016-12-01

But yes, despite this, people, including me, still goes there as it is a Singapore icon. How I wish the service quality can level up. I was expecting the staffs there to be the best of the best. Lastly, I would still like to commend the housekeeping department for a job well done. Especially this chinese guy who's task is to go deliver the microwave that's for rental. He has a very friendly demeanour and is always willing to help. I forgot his name but I hope more MBS staffs can be like him.",6.0,2016-12-01

We had a wonderful, less than 24-hour stay here a couple of weeks ago before getting on a cruise. I could not imagine spending my own money staying here but fortunately we had some points on our soon-to-be-dropped credit card that could get us a room for the night at MBS. We checked in at the registration in Tower 3 and a very courteous caucasian young man helped us get everything straighten up. He upgraded both our rooms (SIL had a paid room) from deluxe to premium and I believe ours was more than a premium room. It was some kind of a corner suite with sitting area and dining area. The room had a city view and the bathroom had the garden view. The main point of staying here was the Infinity Pool,",10.0,2016-12-01

Bad Points  1 in room dining ordered butter chicken for $30 and it was nowhere near to a 5 star hotel food. When complained the staff said we aren't the experts. Basically it was ""eat what's available"" whereas at hotels like these you expect to indulge into chefs creativity   2 Good size buffet but nothing fancy about it!  The items were there but just for the heck of it! None of the dish had the yum factor in it   3 ordered beer along fries in the pool. $12 fries 😳 and the quantity is soo much that you will die eating but will not be able to finish the fries. So basically it didn't fall neither in nibblers category not it justified the price. It would been better to half the qty and charge",6.0,2016-12-01

I have used three hotels in Singapore and I want to rank this hotel in the middle of them. The hotel has a great pool in the roof and many people in the world want to enjoy it. And travelers can appreciate amazing night view of Singapore even in the hotel room. Also, very close to Gardens by the Bay and Flyer. If it is the first time to visit Singapore and if travelers are in good financial condition, I would like to recommend staying this hotel at least one night. But, I think the hotel is not so competitive. Other two hotels have higher cost-effectiveness than Marina Bay Sands based on my experience.

The views from this hotel are amazing but I've had much better service in Melbourne from 4 star hotels, better run and better organised for their customers than this Hotel.
