I made an official complaint which I've yet to receive a call, as I was promised a formal apology. I have stayed at the club room and experienced slow delayed service but that happens. However, the way my sister and I were treated by that server was humiliating. I wish I could have been rude to, but that is not in my nature. Makes you wonder what type of training these kids go through since they can't seem to handle a simple thing such as calling and asking for help when uncertain about a task.

Visitors to the hotel please take note that rooms 01 and 02, 27 and 28 are the closest to the elevators which can be noisy at times.

We booked months ahead on the Pan Pacific website (and not through a third party on line booking agent). Their website stated that if we booked a deluxe suite we could get an upgrade. We communicated by email and was told we would be upgraded but the upgrade would include a surcharge. No problem. When we arrived, no upgrade. Not even when I agreed to pay the surcharge. They couldn’t even put us into our original room which was larger because they were overbooked. Bad business.  In an attempt to reach a compromise, the hotel offered to put us into a room on a high floor. The catch...it was much smaller and too cramped for our family.
