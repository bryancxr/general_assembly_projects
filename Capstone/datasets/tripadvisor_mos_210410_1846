Staying here would mean you need not have to trouble for a place to rest when you walk along Orchard road on the infamous Christmas Eve night.

If you intend to segregate and discriminate bookings, then perhaps some clear signage and wayfinding would help?  Perhaps recognising that he had been rather rude, the young man then said he would register us anyway.

724794568,mos,tripadvisor,2019-11-01,Australia,Our favorite Singapore hotel need an upgrade,"Although the Mandarin Orchard is an excellent property, providing excellent service, well located and reasonably priced it is seriously in need of upgrading access to its Club Lounge. As part of the disruption caused by window upgrade currently being undertaken to the Club Lounge a lift must be installed to provide more sensible access from the Club Reception area to the top floor Lounge. It is an unnecessary and painful experience to climb the two flights of stairs for anyone with disability or knee problems.",8.0,2019-10-01

724464094,mos,tripadvisor,2019-11-01,,Bad Service and Attitude!,"We booked and paid for a premiere room. When we checked in, we were told that we got upgraded to the Club floor, but we’re not able to use the Club facilities (??!). Ok fine, not a big deal. BUT, it turns out that not only was the room in the old tower, the room was a standard size room.  So how is this even an upgrade, when all we got was a smaller room!!  I called the guest services asking about the room, and the person on the phone just simply told me that the room is an upgrade because it’s on the Club floor before impatiently trying to get me off the line. I then went down and spoke to the concierge about this, and I was met with bad attitude and no apologies! Giving a 2 star just because they managed to secure a premiere room - what we actually paid for. Such bad service",4.0,2019-09-01

724386064,mos,tripadvisor,2019-11-01,Australia,Nothing is too much trouble,"We stayed at the Mandarin Orchard to break our journey to Europe (as we had done before). Unfortunately, due to a late flight in Australia, we ended up flying to Singapore via Perth (from Sydney) and arrived the next morning, missing our night's accommodation. The hotel kindly allowed us to use the room all that day with late check out for our late evening flight to Milan. We have also found the staff at the Mandarin very helpful, polite and efficient. The hotel itself is ideally located near the Orchard Road shopping precinct.  Its rooms, restaurants and bars are very high quality.  We love staying at the Mardarin Orchard and will do so again next time we are in Singapore.",10.0,2019-11-01

We were standing in a long qeue waiting for the check-in service. I hear one person in front of us were swearing about the long qeue. I am standing in the qeue with my disavled husband. Finally after waiting for 30 minutes we were served by the check-in hotel staff. Very long procedure of check-in ............ after 15 minutes my husband have to sign on an iPad for the checkin data. Total checkin time qeue 30 minutes + check in process 15 minutes = 45 minutes wasted !!!!!   Checkin process at other hotels took only a couple of minutes.,2.0,2019-11-01
