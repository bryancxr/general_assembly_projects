There was always a wait at the lobby and for the elevator which was uncomfortably crowded. There was limited pool access while we were there and I didn't find the rooms to be above and beyond what one would expect for a decent hotel. I understand the hotel is busy and popular and some of this may be out of the hotels hands but what really made my stay disappointing was the way we were treated by management.

In general, the hotel is super crowded and you will have to wait in line quite a while before you can check in (felt like being at the DMV instead of a 5 star hotel) - luckily, there is a quick check-out though. 2) Paying a room here doesn't really make you feel like a guest, but basically only entitles you to spend more money. E.g., you can pay for a VIP check-in, breakfast is of course not included, etc. So it did just not feel like you got what you paid for.  3) Most importantly for us, but of course a specific situation due to travel times:  What they don't tell you before booking is that you can only access the sky pool from check-in to check-out time,",4.0,2019-09-01
