If there is noone at the booth, please stand in line and wait patiently.   2)I do not really understand the cumbersome check in process using Apple Ipads which takes up a lot of time and really achieves nothing.

Found previous reviews not very detailed as to the club room so here are the details. Rooms are on high floors and the only way to get to them is in a glass lift which runs up the outside of the building. If you do not like heights this is not for you although the views are stunning. The room itself on 33rd floor is much smaller than I expected - the club rooms at the Ritz Carlton are definately much more spacious. The room itself was quite nice but did not have any wow factor as I was expecting after the big refurbishment more functional and possibly aimed at the business traveller.
