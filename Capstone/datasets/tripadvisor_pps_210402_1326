The location is very convenient and looked very cool from the outside, as well as from the inside in the bar and food areas upstairs.  Having said all of this, my wife reminds me the hotel was undergoing renovation, and Singapore is very, very warm - so the mildew etc could have been an unavoidable consequence of some parts of the hotel being open and allowing moisture inside.

315533550,pps,tripadvisor,2015-10-01,,Second visit.,"My first visit was in September 2014. My current visit, 23rd to 28th September 2015. The quality of this hotel is unbeatable. The room was fantastic, with large balcony, with everything we could need. The staff were fantastic. We had stayed in the Pacific Club room. The Pacific Club lounge was fabulous, with views to match. Every member of staff greeted us with smiles & good morning/good afternoon/good evening, every time we saw anybody, right down to the doorman, who every time we arrived back at the hotel, with welcome back, did you have a nice time? Did you find everything you needed? The edge restaurant could not be a better place to eat. This is an hotel I would highly recommend.",10.0,2015-08-01
315505978,pps,tripadvisor,2015-10-01,Malaysia,Just okay.,"The hotel looked worthy of a 5 star hotel, unfortunately, did not smell like a 5 star hotel. I have been told that the floor has been cleaned since we left. We were there during the formula 1 weekend so maybe they have an excuse for it, but their service was also extremely poor.  From the waiting time to check in - where no one seemed interested in helping us - to the delay in arranging a taxi on departure, the service of the personnel at reception is certainly not what we are used to. (waiting time not due to being busy but just a lack of interest in reception staff - I was the only one waiting)  Location is great, but so many better options to chose from, in my opinion. Having said that, it is possible that another couple staying over the same period could have had a",6.0,2015-08-01

Exceptionally comfortable bedding, spacious well appointed decor and a large robe / bathroom. Array of first class facilities including bars and restaurants. Foyer is very impressive and handy access to large shopping mall. Price reflected the appointment of this hotel. ",10.0,2015-08-01

The club room offered a fantastic breakfast, a nice place to relax in the afternoon and a full pre-dinner drinks area. Beer, Wine and Cocktails all offered within the 2 hour period.

315210549,pps,tripadvisor,2015-09-01,Australia,Spectacular!!! Highly recommended!!,"My husband and I stayed at the Pan Pacific Singapore for 3 nights to end our honeymoon. The hotel is absolutely stunning!! The architecture, the restaurants, the facilities and the rooms are just gorgeous! Service was great, and the hotel was very clean. One minor issue was the waiting time at arrival. We waited quite a while before being taken to our room however it was all worth it in the end. Hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. The location is perfect!!! So close to Singapore's stunning icons (literally walking distance to some, or you can catch a taxi which is so easy to find wherever you are). Breakfast was fantastic however not many halal options for dinner in the hotel, but there are plenty of restaurants nearby, as well as a shopping centre directly near the",10.0,2015-06-01
314567660,pps,tripadvisor,2015-09-01,Oklahoma,A spectacular hotel in a great location,"I stayed at the Pan Pacific Marina Square for my first visit to Singapore. I can highly recommend the harbor view balcony rooms. Nicely appointed, and a spectacular view.  My flight arrived after midnight and I ordered room service around 2:30 am. There is an extensive 24 hour menu, and I had an excellent grilled salmon, Every staff member I encountered was extremely efficient and friendly, and the atrium bar is really gorgeous, I would absolutely stay at this hotel again, and will try to the next time work brings me to Singapore.",10.0,2015-06-01

Great location for business and tourism, with nice views of the Marina.  The facilities are first rate - many restaurant choices, easy access to shopping and transport and exceptionally comfortable rooms.  Most importantly, the service was outstanding, remarkably so for such a large hotel.  Staff was consistently well trained, efficient and friendly.  The Pan Pacific Singapore is as nice a hotel as I have stayed in.  I would always recommend it when visiting Singapore.",10.0,2015-06-01

Service was great, staff are friendly and attentive (from front office upon checking in and out, dining in Hai Tien Lo & Edge, relaxing at the pool).  Especially one of the staff @ Edge, as he noticed that I was looking for a glass to get a drink (by the way, I am heavily pregnant), he asked me to hold on awhile and came back quickly with one in less than 5 secs.  *thumbs up!*  The rooms are clean and views are great.",10.0,2015-06-01
