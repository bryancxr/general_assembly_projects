Breakfast was nice since there is international food and not only local cuisine, but in order to be seated I had to wait for 5 min. I ordered three times for a coffee and also for some sugar. Speaking about cleanliness I would say so and so ,because although they made my bed the bathroom and toilet seemed as ""untouched"".

We were in for a late check-in and we arrived at night. We were attended by a young gentleman who asked us if we preferred a smoking or non-smoking room. We requested for non-smoking. However, when we proceeded to our floor, we could detect an extremely strong smoke odor. So I called up the reception counter from the room to enquire if it was a smoking room. At this point, I was already wheezing and having an asthma attack as I am quite allergic to smoke. The staff who picked up the phone proceeded to tell me that there were no more rooms available and asked us to stay there; despite me telling him that I was already ill.

The newly renovated  rooms at the main towers look pleasant but sadly its not well designed.   The shower room is so small. Less than 1m wide. Hot water takes more that 7 minutes to get hot. That is huge waste of time and water to be waiting to get a  quick hot shower in the morning.   Don't be surprise if you experience all sorts of smell coming through the pipes. Its very likely coming from your neighbours (anything from lovely eucalyptus to musky mold and  poop smell) unless you are ready to repack and be moved to another room there is nothing else the hotel can offer.

288364001,mos,tripadvisor,2015-07-01,United Arab Emirates,An Excellent hotel in the right location. Just go for it.,"First of all very great thank you to all staffs for making my stay wonderful.   I stayed in this hotel for 5 days with my family. (2 Adults 1 Child)  The hotel is located right in the middle of Orchard Street, which is a main attraction in Singapore.  From the airport it’s about 25 to 30 minutes journey and it would cost you about 24 sing dollars during morning time and approximate 30 dollars during nighttime. If there is traffic may be an addition of some more. But you can also catch a train from the Changi Airport and get down at Somerset MRT to reach the hotel.  The next station is Orchard but its bit far away from the hotel. So once you get out of the MRT ask anyone how to reach the shopping center 313@somerset or the way to Paragon Shopping Mall. The hotel is located right",10.0,2015-07-01

Upon checkout the concierge looked after our bags for free and offered us a guest room on pickup for us to shower and freshen up before heading to the airport. Staff were knowledgeable and efficient. Hotel was well located on Orchard Rd close to transport and shopping. The breakfast was expensive however and would have cost us an extra $120 per day so we didn't eat at the hotel.

Hotel Services: When I was there, they are having fire drill, so like all other guests, I queue up to check in. While queuing, they came up to me twice to ask if I am served and make sure I am in the right queue. Great attention for the front desk staff.  However, when I tried to use my keys to go up to the club lounge, my keys are rejected. So I have to go back down to change my keys. No big deal but if I am a Club Room guest, I felt this should be a given that my keys can access what I paid for.  Upon check out, the queue is crazily long. Good for me that I have express checkout, could not imagine I have to queue for 1 hr just to check out.  Room: Old, but well maintained.",6.0,2015-06-01

The company who I was meeting with suggested the Mandarin Orchard hotel, both because of its proximity to where our meetings would be held and also because it is a truly nice hotel for business travelers.  The room was spacious, very clean and neat, and well laid-out for doing work.  While not every room has both a shower and a bathtub, mine did.  The shower had a nozzle that allowed you to select from a massage pulse to a gentle rain.  The rain setting was my favorite.  The tub was very narrow, and with the rails to assist those who need such things to rise out of the tub, it seemed like most average-sized Americans would find the narrowness unpleasant.
