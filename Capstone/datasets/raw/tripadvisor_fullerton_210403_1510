Вопрос был в одном - жить в небоскрёбе и смотреть на город сверху, чувствуя себя при этом букашкой, или остановиться в классическом отеле? Выбор пал на второе. Таких отелей практически нет.  Фуллертон - это шикарный колониальный стиль, здание с историей, в самом центре, на набережной залива, прямо напротив МБС. Вид с небольшого балкона на залив и фонтаны, на огни города бесподобен. Отель соответствует своим звёздам, во всех отношениях. Главным отличием от того же МБС (три корпуса с «лодкой» сверху), в котором тоже пожили пару дней - здесь ты чувствуешь себя важным гостем, а не одним из миллиона посетителей , как на конвейере.

The challenge with historic hotels is that even though they are remodeled in the inside, the infrastructure is old. What that means is that there are challenges when it comes to insulation and sounds.   My room at Fullerton was freezing. It was super hot outside and I think my room was intentionally set with air condition on to mitigate this but it went overboard. We turned it off but the room temperature never really normalized and was an icebox unfortunately (I basically curled up under the covers when I was in the room).

The only thing that prevented me from giving an extra star is that the hotel was hosting a celebration for its 90th birthday and quite a lot of the common area was given up to host a classic car show.  It was great to see the cars, but I was there on business and I hadn't anticipated how busy the hotel would be, checking in took a long time (although they did upgrade me as a consequence), the bar was closed to hotel guests and the only place to get food in the hotel was at the outside bar area (oppressively hot and even more oppressively awful band playing).

I was excited about staying at the hotel due to the historical importance the hotel has.   Unfortunately i felt, sadly, underwhelmed considering the price and expectations. The hotel was very busy and is also visited by lots of tourists, it did not feel like a particularly intimate place to stay, lots of people coming and going and the public spaces are large and did not, in my view, feel particularly special.  My room was large but feels like it needs some work in order to modernise. there was a desk in my room but it has a feeling of having been shoved in there and does not feel like it has been well thought out as a space. controls for the curtains and lights seem outdated and should be",6.0,2018-07-01

A few examples:  -The service at the door is consistently appalling. One time, we waited 20 minutes for a taxi. On at least two other occasions, the wait was more than 10 minutes. Other panicked guests were desperately waiting to get to the airport. There was frequently no staff available at the door. THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU EXPECT FROM A LUXURY HOTEL!!!!

In Fullerton’s website, it is clearly shown that the room would come with an adjoining balcony facing Marina Bay. It is exactly with this wording that made us choose the room type “premier quay”.  First, don’t expect you can get the room early after your long flight. Room was not ready at the normal check-in time of 3 pm. Not acceptable for a 5-star hotel.
