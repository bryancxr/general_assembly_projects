It is certainly a very good hotel and here are the positives: - good location - close to everything and right in a very busy distrcit (shopping malls, restaurents, etc..) - 3 restaurents in the hotel facility; all very good - bar with DJ results in interesting atmosphere at nights. - gym is big and has lots of equipment + a tennis court - clean rooms - staff is nice and people at reception speaks perfect English  Here are my downside: - pool is located next by the reception, it is a bit ackward and I didnt feel ""welcomed"" to go - it is a big hotel so expect lots of people/staff, which may make you feel sometime like a number.

It's location in the centre of Orchard Road is very convenient for shopping and access to the MRT. The hotel room was very comfortable and clean and the cleaning of the room was very thorough and unobtrusive. One criticism applies to the cold setting of the air-conditioning which was set we estimate around 16 degrees. A more comfortable setting would be around 20 degrees and this would save heaps of energy.  Also we felt the cost of coffee and meals in the restaurant near the reception desk very expensive for ordinary travellers. ,10.0,2014-11-01

On arrival we got out of the taxi and went to the club rooms lobby, desk staff were not very pleasant and no one offered to take our suitcases, so we wheeled them thru the lobby, the shops and up to the 29th floor ourselves. For a hotel with such a high reputation I thought this lost the luxury feel. The room however made up for the service. Marble and mirrors everywhere and the best shower ever!! The bed was the comfiest we have had in a hotel!  The club lounge on floor 38/39 was beautiful with 360 degree views of the city, morning and night you always saw something different!
