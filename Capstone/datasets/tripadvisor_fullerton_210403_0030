For anyone who is looking for the perfect staycation, look no further! Go with the Fullerton Hotel or the Fullerton Bay Hotel. In the past couple of months, we've had the opportunity to stay at similarly-classed hotels like the Raffles, Capella, the Ritz-Carlton, and St Regis, but the Fullerton family definitely comes out on top because they have both great rooms as well as the service level to back it up.  We had planned for two Fullerton Suites from 7-9 Sep as it was the school holidays, but somehow my booking got messed up (probably through my own fault) and it was booked as one suite from 7-9, and another from 9-11 Sep.
