What a fabulous colonial style hotel this is, the staff are excellent, friendly, efficient and knowledgeable of their city. The Hotel was the old GPO office and government buildings during its colonial life, once the busiest in Asia. It’s had an amazing renovation into the city’s best hotel, we’ve been to Raffles, and the Fullerton is better. The public areas are huge, immaculate and spotlessly clean, so are the bedrooms, we had room 603 on the front of the hotel, facing the marina area, fantastic views, and a lovely room.

The staff were impeccable having arranged a variety of surprises for my wife's birthday. the location of the hotel is on the river but try to make sure that you book rooms that overlook it as the other side looks out over commercial high rise towers. It has a small pool, again overlooking the river and is about a 15 to 20 min walk to the Marina Bay Sands and Marina Bay Gardens. The nearest 'underground' station is a mere 5 mins away and there are numerous restaurants within 5-15 mins walk. Breakfast is extensive and has something for everyone.

740962278,fullerton,tripadvisor,2020-01-01,United Kingdom,Birthday Suprise,What a wonderful experience the hotel is 5 star and the staff are so helpful they are unbelievable. Nothing is to much trouble. The location of this hotel with its iconic appearance on the Singapore river side is fantastic. Which we could stop longer. All attractions of this beautiful city are close to this hotel and the taxi drivers so helpful not that expensive either. The weather in January was fantastic but be warned. It is very very hot and humid. A lot of history is attached to this hotel having been a general post office early in its life. The rooms a superb with all the latest gadgetry such as electric curtains and tablet on the table. The large 48” Samsung tv in the room also makes the late evenings entertainment. I recommend this hotel having also stayed in Raffles 10,10.0,2020-01-01

Lucia noticed that I had only just joined the dinner, and immediately came by to ask me what drinks I needed for my meal.   The food selection was also amazing. There was a wide spread of variety for the food, chinese, Italian, japanese and even a grill selection. Definitely a refreshing change from the other hotel buffet restaurants that we had over the past few years.
