204944550,fullerton,tripadvisor,2014-05-01,,シンガポールの歴史を感じられるホテルです。,夫婦でGWに2泊しました。昔、役場や郵便局として使われてきた建物は重厚で落ち着いており、今話題のホテルのような奇抜な建築との対比として存在感があります。最先端な建築物の多いマリーナベイの風景に一味加えたクラシカルな存在です。 ホテル内は優雅で落ち着いており、マリーナベイの喧騒がウソのようです。GWのためアーリーチェックインは無理でしたが、チェックイン前に訪れたにも関わらず、早めに部屋に通してくれました。事前にメールでマリーナ側希望であること、5月は私の誕生月であることを伝えましたので、マリーナ側Quay roomに。しかも、お誕生日仕様の装飾もしてあり、感激しました。6Fの部屋で眺望は最高！しかし、バルコニーはなく窓が3つの部屋でした。バルコニーの希望も伝えたほうが良かったかもしれません。ちょっと気になったのは、キングサイズベッドの希望を出していたのに、通された部屋にはなぜかシングルベッドが2つ・・・。私たちは「シングルベッドをつなげればいいんだもんね、そのくらい自分たちでやってもいいよね」とあまり気にもとめませんでしたが、気にする人は気にするかも・・・。ましてや、もしこれがハネムーンだったら、イヤだと思う人もいるでしょう。もちろん、その旨を伝え、キングサイズベッドに変換するためのスタッフを頼みました。 プールはこじんまりとしていましたが、シンガポールリバーと高層ビル街を望む落ち着いた雰囲気です。プールサイドでカクテルや軽食も取れるようです。 プールから部屋へ戻ると、お誕生日ケーキとカードが置いてあり、また感激！TWGのお茶と一緒に美味しくいただきました。,8.0,2014-05-01

Of course it's expensive - what isn't in Singapore?! However we couldn't fault any of the staff - all were on the ball at all times, with special mention going to Gavin (Concierge) ... he knows EVERYTHING! Make sure to get a room on the 7th floor - 789 has great balcony views across the water to Marina Bay. Amenities are great, history of the hotel is fascinating, and the hotel is very well located.

The positives: The location of this hotel is right next to the financial district and the MTR. You're a 10 minute walk from many riverside restaurants and a 5 minute walk from the harbour.
