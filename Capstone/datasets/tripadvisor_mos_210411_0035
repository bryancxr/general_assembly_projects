In Singapore, there are other hotels which are more modern and with other famous hotel names, but having stayed in those hotels, I would still prefer the Mandarin Orchard for the following reasons:-  1. The location is excellent, close to the big shopping centers and department stores as well as restaurants. 2. Transportation is also very convenient with taxis and public transport. 3.

I have been back to the hotel with friends several times since, still good. But was able to travel back to the hotel with my sister again, 35yrs after our first visit, there are now 2 towers, but the revolving restaurant on top of the original tower was still there and my sister and I had a beautiful celebration dinner.
