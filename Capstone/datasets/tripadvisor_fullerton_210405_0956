The point of a review of a property such as this one is not to say whether it is a good hotel but to look at whether the Fullerton, good as it may be, is value for money. Because the Fullerton experience costs a lot of cash.  Forget the grand entrance and beautiful saloons.  After all, you can experience any of that by walking into the hotel (there are no restrictions) and spending a while as a guest without booking a room. What you get as a guest is the use of a room and the hotel facilities so the main focus of any review has to be on that.

However, the interior was not quite so. We had a corporate rate room with a courtyard view, which is not a view at all! While large in size, it was dark and lacked style or ambience. The decor was sparse and dull, and a little shabby. The bathroom was fine.   We didn't have time to use the pool, but it looked fab. We chose not to eat at the hotel. Overall our stay was ok.  But I was extremely disappointed with the 20 minute express manicure at their spa. The therapist spoke no English and seemed unsure of what to do, the end result was not good.

However this time, I found myself stepping off a 12-hour pane ride into one of the Fullerton's dreaded Courtyard rooms. They are overwhelmingly depressing, with a brutal view of some other unlucky guest's bedroom. So - you get no view, have to keep your curtains closed and hence your room ends up very dark and plain nasty. To make matters worse, my shower only ran cold. Problem is when you are already jet-lagged you don't have the energy to complain! So my advice is if you stay at the Fullerton ONLY do so if you have a room with a view!

46520041,fullerton,tripadvisor,2009-10-01,滋賀県,お薦めできるホテルです,２００９年９月に２泊しました。 キールームを予約していたので、マーライオンビューを希望したのですが、結局、広めのお部屋にグレードアップしてもらえた代わりに、眺望はそれほど…のお部屋になりました。ただ、ベッドは大きく、バスルームも大変使い易く、コーヒー・紅茶のセットも立派でお部屋には大変満足しました。 朝食は、品数が大変多く、卵料理、ヌードル、野菜ジュースはオーダーしてから作ってくれます。(難を言うなら、日替わりでもう少し変化があると、なお良いと思います。) プールも大きくはないですが、雰囲気があり、またロッカールームがスパと共用なので、とても奇麗で使いやすいです。 コンビニはラッフルズプレイス駅の地下にある小さなセブンイレブンが最寄かと思われます。 去年までシンガポールのホテルはとても値段が高く、こちらのホテルにはとても手がでませんでしたが、今年はかなり値段が下がったので宿泊することができました。評判通りの良いホテルです。機会があったらまた再訪したいです。,8.0,2009-10-01
