ADHD,Got a good grade on a test? A new promotion at work? Finally finished a chore you've been putting off? We want to hear about it! Let us celebrate your successes with you!,What are you proud of today?
ADHD,"Woohoo I am officially done today! I have spent years daydreaming what it would be like to make this post here. And today that daydream comes true.

I'm really elated. Although I should mention that I worked a lot harder than everyone else, at least 3x harder. Part of me also feels I may have been better off not starting it in the first place.  I'll spare more details for now but anyone is curious about something please ask!

Edit: thanks for my first reddit award, kind stranger

Edit2: Also thanks for my 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, ...  awards!

Edit 3: I am trying to reply to everyone's comments, but please bear with me. Idk how it suddenly shot to 2k",Guyss I just finished my PHD!!
ADHD,"Dr. Andrew Huberman is a professor at Stanford, his podcast Huberman Lab is amazing. 10/10 recommend.

He referenced a study done on sleep and performance. Turns out, consistently getting ~about~ the same amount of sleep each night is better than striving for this magical 8 hours (which apparently is kinda bullshit)

So if you sleep for 4 hours, 6 hours, 5 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours... that will be better for you than if you were to sleep 4 hours, 9 hours, 5 hours, 8 hours, 10 hours. I hope that makes sense. 

The most comforting thing is - don’t worry about following a set of rules when it comes to sleeping. If it works for you, you’re probably doing the right thing (even if it’s not the magic number)

So if you stress about “getting enough sleep”, try to be consistent with whatever amount of time you usually get.

this took the pressure off of “not sleeping enough”

:)",I learned something about sleep that you might find comforting!
ADHD,"So this morning I finally made a doctors appointment to talk about my mental health!

It's difficult to express in writing just how big a thing this is, to pick up the phone took a lot of mental preparation. Then after making the appointment I felt bad about not choosing a different day but I'm over that now. :)

Also to commemorate this moment I have finally made a reddit account and would like to thank this **ADHD reddit!** If it wasn't for the relatable posts I wouldn't be so open to getting help!

I would like to post in the future if it turns out I do have ADHD, if I don't I still owe a huge thanks because I'm in my late 20s and really struggling with life. I know my health will benefit from this in the long run!

P.S. Sorry if this post doesn't give much away it's my first post and I'm feeling a bit shy about posting heheh :)",I've finally made a doctors appointment! And a reddit account!
ADHD," I am not stupid. I can do a whole lot and I know a lot. But I just don't know what job I want to do for some time now. My focus keeps changing and now, after a bachelor's degree and master's degree, I'm still not sure what I want to do. Programming? Game design? During my free time, I just can’t bring myself to educate myself even more. But I need to, I need to make more, prototypes, trying out more gameplay, anything. I just can’t. But in the gaming industry, very specialized knowledge and a lot of practice is required. At the same time, I'm not even sure if I want to work on games. Maybe I'd rather do graphic design? Or something with writing? Maybe something completely different that I don't even know about yet.

Being so unsure if it is the right thing to do demotivates me so much. I just want to be able to have one goal and work on it. Just try to be the best I can be in this specific field. But I can't. That frustrates me so much. Why am I making it so hard for myself? Why can't I just be sure what I want to do? Why do I keep doubting everything? 

I am so exhausted by myself.",It feels like ADHD is robbing me of my potential
ADHD,"Hello. I’ve been suspecting that I have ADHD for a couple months now after talking to my therapist and doing lots of research, I actually have an appointment this Friday to get tested for ADHD. 

Something I’ve always noticed is that I tend to absorb the emotional energy of the people and the environment around me. If everyone is stressed and a little tired at work (I work in food service) then I start feeling that way, regardless of how great and energetic I’ve felt that day.

The biggest place I’ve noticed this with is my husband, when he gets upset and or angry at something, regardless if I am the cause or not, I start to feel that way if I’m around him and it usually ends up with me not wanting to be in the same room as him because this negative cloud of emotion he is feeling just consumes me.

Does anyone else experience this as well? I know a heightened sense of your emotions is an ADHD sign and I am just wondering if that could be a correlation?",Absorbing the emotional energy in your environment?
ADHD,"I have ADHD, depression, anxiety, and possibly bipolar 2. My brain is physically different due to the adhd alone. 

The other day my partner described moving to another task briefly while in the middle of a debate with me (I had to vacuum real quick) and he told me he forgot what it was and had to reconstruct his thoughts when we resumed our conversation. Maybe he's adhd as well but idk. It also doesn't help I don't have a baseline for ""normal"" lol.

I basically cannot fathom how ""normal"" people function. My brain is CONSTANTLY going. I'll start on one thought and end up on another which is a complete 180. And when I tell someone my thought process, that's conpletely logical and rational to me, they look at me funny. Like, what??? How does it not make sense to you??

Can I also mention how fuckin tired I am all the god damn time? Idk if its my depression or adhd or both but i am routinely exhausted. I'll get hit with random waves of strong fatigue. It feels like I can't do anything because I'm so tired. I feel like i could sleep all day and night and STILL be tired. It doesn't make sense! And normal people don't deal with that??? They're just... awake??? And when they're tired they drink caffeine and then they're awake??? With caffeine there's a 50/50 chance it wakes me up or puts me to sleep. I don't understand how that fuckin works but it does.

Ya know what else I don't understand? How do people just... do things?? Like, their brain says 'do the thing' and their body just gets up and does it???? Mine is like a lump and won't move unless I scream internally a lot. And even then it doesn't always work. I know its called executive dysfunction but its still something thats difficult to comprehend for me lol.

I know there's nothing wrong with me in comparison to others but it's kinda mind boggling to think about. Sometimes i wonder what it's like to be neurotypical.",I cannot fathom how neurotypical people function.
ADHD,"My 7-year-old daughter, who is awaiting diagnosis, tries her hardest but struggles to focus and remember what she needs to do. She's a lot like me.

As we were leaving for school, we went through her schoolbag checklist.

""Homework?""

""Yep.""

""Lunch?""

""Got it""

""Piano Books?""

""Oh, I forgot, they're in my room!"" 

Her piano books are a big issue. She has lessons at school once a week and often forgets them.

We get to school and I drop her off only to realise that I have lost my wallet. Crap. I've left it at my friend on the other side of town's house. So I head over to his house. Soon as I arrive, I get a call from school.

""Your daughter has forgot her lunch.""

HOW?!?! It was in her bag. I saw it! 

Oh well, I chat with my friend for a couple of minutes and then head back to pick up her lunchbox and...the phone rings. It's the school wondering where I am. IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME! I wasted the whole morning with my friend! I grab the lunchbox (it was under a pile of books) and head to the school.

She gets her lunch ten minutes late and every is fine.

I've just walked in the door and sitting in front of me on the kitchen table is the ""pile of books"" her lunch was under.

It's her piano books. 

I need a drink.

**I'm making this a success because we solved the problem (mostly) and didn't panic. We've got each others backs and that's a win in my (piano) book.**",What happens when Dad and Daughter BOTH have ADHD.
ADHD,"A colleague forwarded me [this article](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/03/what-pandemic-doing-our-brains/618221/) about ""Pandemic Brain"" and I just found it to be heartbreaking and ironically amusing. For example, here's a description of what the author is experiencing:

&gt; Sometimes I grasp at a word or a name. Sometimes I walk into the kitchen and find myself bewildered as to why I am there. (At one point during the writing of this article, I absentmindedly cleaned my glasses with nail-polish remover.) Other times, the forgetting feels like someone is taking a chisel to the bedrock of my brain, prying everything loose. 

It's like: Yeah.  That's me ALL THE TIME.  That was me on my BEST days BEFORE the pandemic.

Another quote:

&gt; Everywhere I turn, the fog of forgetting has crept in. A friend of mine recently confessed that the morning routine he’d comfortably maintained for a decade—wake up before 7, shower, dress, get on the subway—now feels unimaginable on a literal level: He cannot put himself back there. 

Again, me, every single day BEFORE the pandemic.

One more:

&gt; Jen George, a community-college teacher from Cape Elizabeth, Maine, told me she is losing her train of thought in the middle of a sentence more and more often. Meanwhile, her third grader, who is attending in-person school, keeps leaving his books, papers, and lunch at home. Inny Ekeolu, a 19-year-old student from Ireland, says she has found herself forgetting how to do things she used to do on a regular basis: swiping her bus pass, paying for groceries.  

Argh! This is me functioning normally!  


But, it's not all doom and gloom.  I am THRILLED at the notion of finally being able to adequately explain how my brain works to neurotypicals after the pandemic is done.  *""Hey, do you remember how trying to do everyday normal things during the pandemic were so hard, and it felt like being in a fog all the time?  Well, have I got news for you.""* :)

ADHD,"I've tried nearly every mainstream focus tip there is-- Pomodoro clocks, candy for every completed task, Habitica website, etc., and none have really worked for me. These all rely on a Dopamine reward for doing thing, which ADHD dampens.

That's why in the past month I've started using Serotonin incentives. Make being productive feel good. Create a good atmosphere that you associate with productivity. For me, it's Black Coffee, Lofi Music, a soft blanket I throw on my lap, a desk I use for nothing else, a candle, and the occasional piece of White Chocolate, but it can be anything.

It's a lot easier to make working feel good than it is to convince yourself to trudge through painful work.",Motivation Tip: Dopamine rewards don't really work for us. That's why I focus on Serotonin as an incentive.
ADHD,"Dude it literally took me almost a minute to decide on either exclamation points or those specific 3 emojis. Man this post is probably gonna sound like shit because when I write and overthink I just say forget it and write tacky but now everything seems alright, I’m not overthinking. A little now I’m back to overthinking hey but now I’m not because I’m smoothly texting kinda sorta. FUCK!!! Shit dude I hate overthinking because I feel slow when I do it. Like I can’t have a conversation, I get scared to text or call anybody including the people I love because I overthink that. I’m a confident dude I get told this a lot and I feel it sometimes and when I say sometimes I mean other times when I’m not feeling it I’m still able to project confidence but Im too stuck in my own fucking head!

Adhd is cool but it’s too much information and it’s a lot of bullshit Information just like the damn internet. We just keep taking that info and adding it to our vault just because and then shred it but keep the paper because we might need it. “Most times we don’t“  WHO SAID THAT?... yeah I just hate the overthinking aspect, and also the getting bored with it too quickly even tho you were fucking passionate about it",I HATE OVERTHINKING EVERYTHING😫😫😫
ADHD,"Trying to focus on something boring feels like trying to look directly at one of those floater things in your eye. 

I am sitting here trying to focus and literally getting distracted by my eye floaters, then I can't even look directly at them.

To add insult in injury, coming to post this is also a distraction.",I just realized something.
ADHD,"I just realised that I’ve never thought, verbatim, that my issue was “I can’t concentrate on what the teacher is saying for long”. Never really considered it an attention issue (whether deficit or dysregulation, I assume the latter is more accurate). 


Instead, I always joked I get bored easily and it’s hard to push through my disinterest. Or I thought I was just sleepy, just tired, if I just rested more I could definitely listen to the whole lecture. I’d definitely change next class. 


So it got me wondering how other people interpreted their symptoms differently.",Have you always noticed you couldn’t focus on lectures?
ADHD,"Ever wonder why you can’t achieve your goals? 

Let me tell you why. 

Achieving goals requires consistency. But consistency is boring.

It’s boring because you have to do the same thing over and over. For example, you want to learn to cook. 
You have to be CONSISTENT. You have to cook every week. You have to cook the same time to master it. 

But BORING is the death of us. The second we are bored with something, we move on to the next goal. 

So that is why we can’t always achieve our goals. 

CONSISTENCY = BOREDOM 😕",Consistency is boring
ADHD,"As the title says, I thought I'd share some of my skills I have learned over the years that help mitigate some of my adhd symptoms. I am aware that everyone experiences the symptoms of this disease differently, so I will add that these tips may not be for everyone, but I figured they may help some.

\- Eat a high-protein breakfast as soon as you can in the morning. This has some scientific backing that you can research, but essentially it sets your brain up for good performance. Eggs, meat, protein bars, etc. are all things that have helped me feel more mentally prepared during the early hours of the day. 

\- To help cut down on ""time-blindness"" related shenanigans, I started playing a game where I try to guess the time before each time that I check a clock. I've always been surprised just how bad I was at predicting the amount of time some tasks take, but after doing this trick for a bit it has gotten a little better for me. 

\- Put your overactive imaginations to work! I have always had an overactive imagination, running so constantly and vividly that it sometimes is the main cause of my distractions. I'm sure some of you have experience in this. I've had some success generating interest in dull tasks and work-related things by just simply imagining it being more interesting. I know this sounds childish, but who cares if it works right?

\- Caffeine is more helpful by itself than it is with all of the sugar and add-ins from energy drinks and supplements. Caffeine consumed as stand-alone pills can be pretty effective at helping to maintain focus and clarity without too many side effects (watch your intake, no more than 2-3 200mg pills spaced out over a day for most people). Energy drinks can be great for improving alertness and boosting energy, but I have always found they actually reduce my ability to focus. This is not the case with coffee, tea, and other things that have caffeine without all the add-ins (such as taurine, insane amounts of b-vitamins, etc.). 

\- Make removing clutter a high priority. Clutter is a way of life for a lot of us, but trying to mitigate symptoms while surrounded by unfinished obligations causes sensory overload for me. Speaking for myself, when I enter a room in my house I literally notice and am fully aware of all the visible clutter in the room. I've realized that this takes up valuable resources in my brain that could be better spent on other things. I notice that I have an easier time managing symptoms when I have eliminated the clutter. As for the motivation to get it done, the best time for me is on a day off, immediately after breakfast, coffee, and medicine. 

\- More frequent short breaks are better than fewer long breaks. I feel like my brain works on a shorter time scale than others. Anticipating a 30 minute break that is 4 hrs into my shift is distant enough into the future that it is almost abstract in my awareness. Taking a 5 minute break every hour keeps me focused and refreshed and I have an easier time staying aware of what I can do within that hour before a quick break. 

\- You don't need a bullet journal, you just need a notebook with page numbers and an index. This is essentially what a bullet journal is, but don't bother with all the other stuff that people swear you need (calendars, habit trackers, etc.) you just need a place where you can write notes and be able to find it easy for later. If you already have a system that works for you that is great, but I find with a lot of adhd people that adding all the extras that require consistency are just adding more things to keep track of that really aren't that helpful. They also just add more things to procrastinate on which can lower your mood. Keep it simple and don't create more obligations in an attempt to help keep track of your current obligations. 

This is all I can think of for now. I hope Someone can find some useful advice somewhere in here. These are all things that have helped me. Maybe some of you already do these things?",Some of the self-management skills I have learned over the years that help me with my symptoms.
ADHD,"I know I shouldn't feel this way but I can't help it. 

Like just now I got home from the gym and needed to take a shower so I went to my room and was putting my gym clothes with my dirty clothes but then started taking pictures of my room cause I came up with a hypothetical situation where someone asked what my room looked like so I was there explaining in my head to a person who doesn't exist what everything is. 

And then I started looking at a drawing I did and moved on to something else and then realized that I am extremely sweaty and need to take a shower but got distracted and like I don't even know when or how it happened. 

It's almost like how in a dream you just teleport somewhere else but don't think anything of it until later when you don't know when or how you got to the current place.

Anyways, it just makes me want to cry cause I feel like I have no control over what I do and it's so frustrating and I don't kbow why this instance in particular makes me so sad but I think it's just cause I've had a bad week and I just need to vent.","I get so sad, frustrated, and disappointed with myself whenever I realize that I was supposed to be doing something else and somewhere along the way got distracted by just random stuff ."
ADHD,"I can’t explain it to anyone. Not in a way they’d understand. I’m venting, because it hurts, knowing my career is destroyed, my life in ruins, all because of this fucking condition, despite all the medication.

My ADHD never interfered with my learning, because I’d get everything done before I lost interest. For my entire life, I was the first one done with exams. I’d usually ace them too. I took the LSAT after maybe studying it for an hour, about the most I could manage. I got a 166.

I graduated a top 20 law school in the top 20% of my class.

And I am a failure.

In the past five years since graduating, I have been fired from 3 jobs for performance issues, all from 2017-2018. I had to run around doing social security disability hearings on a contract basis for a year and a half, before getting a job as general counsel for a small company (hence my name) before that too ended in January. They said my performance wasn’t an issue and it was just that they took on in-house too early. Maybe, but, in my head, I wonder otherwise, although I never did get a complaint.

I regularly get fleeting suicidal thoughts because of how frustrated and despondent I am about my career. All my life, everyone said I’d do great. Instead, I’m a fucking bum. I won’t hurt myself, I’m devoutly Catholic, couldn’t do it, also I know people love me.

It’s impossible to explain to people. They say “You’ll bounce back”. What suggests I will bounce back? I fucking can’t keep a job.

I have a great doc who truly cares, and we are changing my medications. But I don’t think it will matter. I’ve been medicated since the first grade. I take it every day. It made no difference at my job.

I feel robbed. I feel like I got the ultimate screw. To be good throughout school, and then to fail when it matters. I wish I wasn’t smart at all. At least I’d have no expectations.

ADHD,"August 2019, we moved into a new house. About a week after we moved, I did a sea salt face mask. Just a little packet of salt that you mixed into water, made a neat exfoliant.

ADHD,"Hello all,

I've noticed in these past few days that I've been disassociating more than usual. In the past I'd only dissociate every few weeks, and it usually passed after a bit. But now, it's happening more often, usually at nighttime. It lasts for a while, and it's a really scary feeling. I'm not sure what's causing it. It's way different from just ""zoning out""... my brain feels foggy,  I'm a bit confused, and I just feel detached from everything. I'm not sure if online school/staring at screens for 8+ hours a day has anything to do with it, but it's concerning. Has anyone else been experiencing this more often lately?",I've been dissociating more often
ADHD,"A month or two ago I really got the idea that I could have un-diagnosed ADHD. Basically looking into how it presents in adults, looking at threads here of other folks experience and having constant ""oh my god, that's exactly what I'm like"" reactions, etc.

My story, why I think I have ADHD:

* emotional / short-fuse as a kid
* As a young child I heard stories of me running out of class to go have recess when it wasn't time, but I don't remember it.
* Had major problems rambling and people think I was annoying
* Throughout elementary school teachers always giving the feedback that I'm doing well, but daydreaming all the time
* Later elementary school once we had our first ""long-term"" projects (rather than just daily assignments) is when I started to have a hard time. Had one that my Mom essentially did in 5th grade because I put it off to the last minute, another in 6th grade that I failed but hid the report card from my parents so they never found out.
* Always pacing during conversations, can't sit still
* Jr. high I got good grades but continuing the trend of assignments all being completed last minute when the urgency kicks in. Lost a letter grade in Science even though I did well on the tests because our teacher required them to be taken home to be signed by parent
* High school always running late, trouble getting assignments in on time, didn't take study halls because I couldn't use the time appropriately anyways. Got everything done super quick last minute anyways.
* Had a teacher organize their seating chart based solely on where I was sitting relative to my friends (because I talked so much during class)
* Fell asleep during ACT's but still got good enough grades to go to state school
* In college same thing...just got everything done last minute. But it seems like everyone did that??? I don't know...
* A lot of anxiety / depression because I feel like I'm not reaching my potential because I'm lazy / unmotivated
* Now I've been working for 6 years at a company that has a culture of very little oversight and a ton of meetings. I don't have a problem attending meetings because I just multi-task if it's boring and walk around the house. Outside of attending meetings and responding to emails if I have any independent work it often takes me days / weeks to build up the motivation to do a couple hours of work. On average I probably do only about 30 minutes to 1 hour of independent work per day

The ""problem"" is that I've been successful in my job but I feel super trapped. Like I've found this niche situation where I'm being paid decently, have a great manager, great work-life balance, but I feel horrible because I feel like I'm doing 1/10th of what I could be doing if I could just work 8 hours a day.

Had a meeting with a new therapist yesterday and we just went down the rabbit hole of talking about my job. She didn't say it, but I got the vibe that she didn't really think I had ADHD, and was just going on about ""what are your goals"", ""I think your job is just too easy and you're bored"", ""you're unmotivated because you don't have accountability"", etc......

I don't know....maybe I'm overreacting, but I just feel like I needed some validation that's like ""yup, it sounds like you have ADHD""....and I didn't get that. I know the things that she's saying are probably helpful whether I get the diagnosis or not....but it just has me second guessing things.

What's your take?

Organizing my life and doing all the ""normal"" things is so overwhelming to me. I never remember what I'm forgetting or not doing.

In university, lectures were such a slow pace and so boring.

At the end of the semester I saw my exam of the course I forgot on my schedule two days before the test. I crashed the entire course in two days of hyperfocus before the exam and got the highest mark in the class (final exam was 100% of the grade if you missed the midterm).

I know I'm smart and it has gotten me by and on the outside it seems I'm thriving in many aspects. I've been promoted early for everything and seen as an overachiever. I've been at my job for 10 years but bounced around from division and function every couple years maximum. I change my work location every couple hours, and can't sit at a desk for a 9-5. I change where I live often and jetset around the world. 

I struggle so hard to get up in the mornings. I didn't know that was associated with ADHD. I sleep in until the last minute or miss things. In grade 10 I spent a semester unable to get out of bed on Mondays until the afternoons and would miss my mornings of school. 

I honestly can't remember what I can't remember as to all the reasons I think maybe I could have ADHD.

Last week I tried Adderall for the first time to see what effect it would have (not via prescription). I was able to sit for HOURS and work. I got things done I had been putting off for MONTHS. But I also felt like a zombie and not myself. 

I'm overwhelmed. What if I have ADHD? And now that I've thought maybe I do and it could explain so much in my life, what if I don't??? I'm almost more scared I dont have it. 

I'm trying to get myself to go through the diagnosis process now but it's hard. I have to try and organize my benefits package, sign up for their online portal, figure out how to contact their services, etc. I spent some time today then gave up. 

I'm overwhelmed but I just want to say I understand this community and so many things I've read here. But it's exhausting to try and navigate next steps.",I'm 34 and may have ADHD! It's overwhelming!
ADHD,"I had a break down the other day, and I finally realized I need help managing my ADHD. I work full time and go to law school at night. I think that I identify as Asian American, and I feel like when I was diagnosed, I solely relied on medication without pursuing CBT. 

I think part of the reason I never sought help was because the psychologist who originally diagnosed me, never understood the cultural dynamic within my family. It was already hard enough to get me diagnosed, and get past the stigma. She also said some problematic things about Chinese restaurants with problematic micro aggressions. 

I also went to the therapists on campus who were free. And I felt uncomfortable talking to her. 

I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions for ways to find mental health services specifically for someone who struggles with cultural identity and ADHD. 

I also want to find someone that can offer assessments, since i need extra time for the bar exam and it needs to have occurred within 2 years. And the last time

 My dad is worried that if I don’t go back to the same psychologist, they may not  re-diagnose me again since my grades are ok.

ADHD,"Hello I'm 26F. I was diagnosed not even a year ago but suspected it a while before. There were signs, seems obvious now. This means I suddenly recognise some patterns in other people.

**My mother has undiagnosed ADHD, I am sure of this.**

She went through a rough time when I came around due to other reasons and was under stress.

Growing up:

1.There's unread bills and papers everywhere. We always had cereal and other crap for dinner in front of the TV (3 times a week tops I'd say bc my grandparents were involved otherwise). 

2.We had a bedroom in our house we couldn't use because it was so filled with unused furniture and papers and so much stuff that she never got to. We had to climb if we needed something (wasn't dirty, it was just many things)

3.I had a backlog of vaccinations to get. I had to get 3 at once, one time, because they were past due and the school wouldn't let me enroll otherwise (no she's not anti Vax, she's just overwhelmed when there's things to get done). I never got the HPV vaccine for the same reasons even though it was free.

4. Mood swings, so much accumulated frustration. It got worse when I became an ADHD teenager of course and there were a lot of fights.

5. She always got into projects at home and then had a couple accidents. Eg. Decided to paint the cupboards and accidentally ended up glueing her forehead to the cabinets. Dropped the ladder and went to pick it up without noticing glass shards, needed many many stitches, there was so much blood. And many other things.

6. After moving out I had to go to her place and she didn't want me to. I found out its because it was an incredible mess. She is amazing at cleaning up the day before, it looks like there was never any mess. But you can't ever go unannounced...

7. She has this compulsion to say she'll help and then the time comes and she doesn't do the things she said she would, and she's the one who offered.

8. We were late to everything. I was always late to school, she often was late to pick me up. Lateness is a main thing in my life and her life and it's impossible to correct at this point.

Did you guys notice the same in your parents?

I wish she were diagnosed so she could have recognized it in me instead of not knowing how to parent and me being a ""bad child"" and demonized for leaving a wet towel on my bed and not tidying my room enough.

There were weirdly too many steps and obstacles in my mind to just do it here and instead chose to do a way more sensible thing and drag it with me every weekend.

It's kind of a prime example of how my ADD is holding me back in life. Then today I spoke to some of my best friends in high school. They all finished their studies, have jobs and boyfriends, one is even buying a home.

And I'm sitting here not able to respond anymore because I'm embarrassed of how I've accomplished next to nothing. I'm still trying to graduate after many many years.

ADHD,"TL;DR: any advice on constant exhaustion/fatigue?

I'm just tired all the time. It doesn't help that I've moved back home and due to the time difference have to work online till 3:30 am. Seroquel helps me sleep at night (diagnosed bipolar as well) but I'm just... a zombie during the day. 

Pre-covid, my highest high was the brief period where I was living my best life. I miss the routine that I worked hard to create, waking up before dawn, enjoying the sunrise and quiet morning, while also magically  being more productive in those 2 hours than the other 22 during the day. Getting in some exercise and nature on my bike ride to work, lunch hour zumba class at my work gym and evenings to people-watch or read at a park, tend to my community garden or socialize. My mind, body and soul felt nourished. This was a big win after a lifetime of trouble sleeping and waking up - I had finally found a way to have a fully occupied day to tire myself out and fall asleep at a decent hour. Of course, this would come and go with slumps in mental health but it gave me hope of a semblance of normalcy and balance for my life. Now I can hardly drag myself out of bed at 2 in the afternoon after 10 hours of sleep. 

Depression hit me hard late last fall when I decided to move home but it has been a chaotic mess. My parents are super supportive but my home/family life is crazy and overwhelming, my schedule and medication has been a bit out of whack (I was diagnosed ADHD in Oct but hadn't started on adderall yet while adjusting my depression/bipolar meds) and the one doctor I approached to get my prescription transferred was an abominable adhd denier. I am honestly infuriated by those who claim to be in a profession to help people, or at least do no harm, ignorantly invalidate our experiences and the SCIENCE behind this neurobiological condition which frankly, most of us have worked so hard to come to terms with due to the stigma and disinformation out there. 

It has been over 2 months and I'm so tired. I'm tired of being a husk of myself - the me I have seen and the potential that I know. I just can't function as a human being. I'm drifting along day by day as my heart aches to just brush my teeth. I haven't showered in weeks. The mental jujitsu by which I plan and negotiate what I can do tomorrow and then silently watch in pain as I can't bring myself to do any of it. I'm just sick of myself.

The worst part is, I was so elated with my diagnosis. It finally helped me answer so much about my struggles, gifted kid who completely crumbled in college and all my plans and ambitions which never materialize. I had something tangible to say: I'm not lazy and unmotivated and dumb, I'm fighting a real condition in my brain day to day to survive. But I've somehow fallen prey to the belief that I am incapable without the medication I need which will cure me and help kick start my brain to do all I want to.

ADHD,"\[Disclaimer: I'm not saying using nicotine is a good idea. I'm not saying you shouldn't try to quit it if you're addicted, you probably should. This is just observation\]

I've just recently realized that I have problems in my life that I can really only explain by me working differently. Seeing videos and reading about ADHD has been an eye-opener. I've heard countless times that people with ADHD tend to self-medicate, and boy does that make sense to me now.  
I've had some revealing observations lately, related to my (believed) ADHD and brain altering substances.

Dec 20 last year I quit nicotine (bags). My feeling has been that my mind is scattered and I'm restless. I've been unfocused, have had immense troubles with following through on tasks, quite absent minded as well. When I've sat down and tried to work, I've had a hard time motivating me to even do stuff I know is simple. I think about how many extra steps it will take and it just doesn't feel effortless.

I've noticed this and attributed it to me quitting nicotine. I've quit before, in my experience it took a couple of months for me to not think about picking up the habit again. Only this time the scattered brain and restlessness never wore off, it's almost 3 months since I quit and I don't feel ""recovered"". Really, I'm not quite sure they ever did the previous times.

I've been a mess at work right now. That and I'm waiting for my next appointment, it's 3 weeks away.

Yesterday I bought nicotine mints in hopes of it relieving some of the symptoms I've been experiencing. I want to point out that I believe myself to be fully recovered from the nicotine bags, I've been resolute on not picking up that habit again. This was a conscious decision in hopes of relief and so that I can focus on work.

Today I've used 4 mints: 2 before lunch, 2 after. I just want to say that I'm baffled, the effects are very noticeable. A few minutes in I felt more focused, more purposeful, less overwhelmed, there was less of a barrier to just do stuff and I actually dug into something I've been dreading and putting off for too long.  
I'm not saying nicotine made me employee off the month, but it pushed me over a threshold I've been trying to cross for several months now, in a very noticeable way.

As a comparison, each mint is 1mg, so that's 4mg for the whole work day. Each nicotine bag is 1-2mg, and I might've gone 10-15 in a work day.  
The mints just lie in your mouth until they're gone, for 2.5h, the intake is much slower compared to the bags. There was SOME withdrawal at 16:00, which I might need to keep in mind.

Of course I don't want to get into an addiction again, I'd rather find medication that's tuned to my needs. But it's very clear to me now how nicotine have affected me in my life both when I've been on and off it.  
I'm probably gonna use mints until then, but I might try to use less than 2 per 2.5h period.  
I'm actually just baffled about the effects it had on my work morale.",Nicotine as a cognitive enhancer
ADHD,"Hello! 

I was previously on 10mg of Adderall XR and it was astronomically too high of a dose for me (for reference I get high off of the adult dose of Benadryl and am a lightweight with basically every substance and medicine ever) so my doctor moved me to 5mg of Adderall XR and it works great... after a few hours. In the first 4-5 hours I’m exhausted beyond belief. 

Being at home during the pandemic is helpful while trying to adjust / find a medication that works for me, but I wanted to pop in here and ask if this is normal? I get so incredibly tired on Adderall, like all I could do right now is just sleep for ages. Will this fatigue reaction go away? It makes me feel a bit foggy and tired and I feel more “focus” but I also feel groggy and exhausted. I feel like I could accomplish more if I *wasnt* tired. 

I read on here someone saying that if your sleep schedule is bad it can cause this to happen because addy will highlight any sleep deprivation you might have. 

Anyway, any advice? Will this probably go away as I get used to Adderall? This is my first time taking any adhd medication. Is there anything I might be doing wrong? I started getting some muscle twitches and I breifly wondered if my electrolytes are off, last time I had muscle twitches it was because my diet was sorely lacking potassium. 

If I allow myself to sleep while on Adderall , I end up waking up feeling very refreshed and totally ready to take on anything but this ruins my schedule.

EDIT I WANTED TO ADD: I am in pretty close easy contact with my doctor and psychologist, they’re a message away via a patient portal and ultimately I’ll be bringing it up with them too, but I wanted to hear from the experience of other adhd’ers about this.

EDIT 2: I am also wondering what about diet can affect this. I read that protein consumption can really affect how stimulants work for adhd and my protein consumption has NOT been adequate lately.",Really Tired First Week or Two on Adderall?

ADHD,"Hi, I’m a college freshman with ADHD. Throughout my high school, and now college, career, my mom has been constantly stressed out and upset with me for my inability to complete tasks on time, forgetting things i’m supposed to do, putting things (schoolwork) off to the last minute (this one especially), etc. She is a great and loving mom but often calls me lazy and irresponsible for these things which has made me feel very insecure, guilty, and inferior until I did more reading about my diagnosis and realized my ADHD had been causing these issues all along (these feelings didn’t stop there, but it did help).
My mom is neurotypical and has never suffered from mental illness. She is an extreme perfectionist who has to have everything and order and just does not understand why I always seem to screw these sorts of things up. I’m wondering if anyone has a good resource I could give her to read/view about these symptoms to help her understand. (A resource about functioning with ADHD and depression- which I also suffer from and it seems to make things 10 times harder- simultaneously would be perfect if anyone could find that, but I understand it might be hard to find/ is not what the subreddit is for.)

However, I missed another appointment I was supposed to do today because I just completely forgot about it despite setting alarms and reminders for myself. My mom told me that I won’t be allowed to look into getting an animal until I start being more responsible. This was very hard for me to hear and I’m just hoping for a resource to help her understand. Sorry if this is off topic of the subreddit. Thank you all for your help!!",Resources for Parents
ADHD,"Hi folks, hope y'all having a productive day!

I'm male, recently got diagnosed with ADHD in my mid-late 20s, still a college student. I immigrated to US at 17 from a second world country. My family was dysfunctional since I know when, they finally divorced at my mid teen. In school, I didn't get bullied but often felt out of place and still then.  Growing up my dad always instill value in education even though his teaching got repetitive. With my undiagnosed, impulsive condition, needless to say I was a bad student. Now looking back, I resent him for not spending time teaching me essential stuff like swimming, fixing around the house, cooking. 

My question is if I'm an a\*\*hole to cut ties because when he called I don't really feel anything toward him. He remarried and have 1 kid with new wife so safe to say he has a life of his own now.

Like you shouldn't talk because you spend the day zoning out all the time, so why do you have any authority to speak about anything at all?

For example, I'm currently writing a personal statement about something that I have authority on and am passionate about, but upon editing, I keep finding it riddled with minimizers (""somewhat,"" ""a bit,"" etc).

ADHD,"On medication, specifically.

This is my second semester having been diagnosed, and the last semester was a mess of trying to find the ""right"" adderall dosage. And I thought I found it! I thought that this semster was going to go well! But here we are, midway point of the semester, and shit has hit the fan. I accidentally opted to have 3 major assignments due in the same week, and I'm a week and a half behind in my readings. All my planning and scheduling and good intentions hasn't helped a bit. The more important something is, the more terrifying and paralyzing it is. It constantly makes me wonder if I should even be in school. I love learning, I love my classes, but it's like I'm incompatible with college.

All that to say: I missed an adderall dosage today. And looking back, I feel nearly the same despairing sense of paralyzed inability on adderall or off.

OR it might make me ask ""Does that mean that Adderall isn't the right drug for me?""

ADHD,"TLDR: Just started Adderall XR a few days ago and it has been everything I hoped for. But being able to function for the first time makes me feel guilty for relaxing or doing purely recreational things in my free time. If I forget to do ONE thing on my to do list, I beat myself up. Seeking advice or support from others who dealt with this. 


I’m nearly a week into being on Adderall for the first time and it’s been absolutely life changing. But I have been struggling with an unexpected insecurity and fear. I find the absolute bliss of being able to do the things I want to do, has also hit me with the fact that I have spent so many years wasting time. I have this underlying fear that this is too good to be true and I’ll eventually become useless again. I have all this stress that I NEED to do everything I have to do immediately. Which is the exact opposite of how I have felt my whole life. I also feel guilty if I spend too much time doing something merely for pleasure. Because it is preventing me from doing productive things. In a way, I love this feeling so much, but I just don’t know how to deal with it healthfully. 

It’s to the point that I feel guilty relaxing at night with my boyfriend. Before, I was so depressed that all I looked forward to was eating dinner, watching movies and then sleeping, and I was slightly co-dependent on my boyfriend. Now, once night comes all I think about is how much I can’t wait to wake up and accomplish more things. 


Has anyone here struggled with this ironic issue after finding the right medication? How did you deal with it? Did you just naturally start to balance out? I am experimenting with having a scheduled day so I get everything done that I need to, and don’t feel guilty for taking the rest of the day off. Has anyone had success with scheduling your day? 

Thanks. ♥️","I love adderall, but omg, I didn’t see this coming."

ADHD,"I was recently diagnosed with anxiety, recurrent depression, and unspecified ADHD. My therapist has been discussing with me about whether I believe the struggles of ADHD match my experiences and I really don't know. I asked her how to tell if what it is if I'm having a tough time and based on her description this is my understanding:

&gt;ANXIETY - Irrational belief of a threat that isn't there. ex: Hearing a noise and feeling scared because of the belief that a serial killer is outside.  
&gt;  
&gt;DEPRESSION - Sadness or disinterest that is untriggered and unaffected by environment. ex: If you feel like you're worthless and a good friend explains how you're a good person, it has no effect.  
&gt;  
&gt;ADHD - Unregulated response to the environment. ex: Getting really angry at something mildly annoying but feeling great when someone says something nice about you; Feeling anxious because of overstimulation but no irrational fears; basically just really dependent on what's happening around you

But this is kind of based on the symptoms that I tend to experience but I was wondering if anyone else has a way to tell the difference? Or if anyone has resources where I can read about it? 

I'm not sure why I care so much but I think I just want to know so I can better understand myself and how to cope. Most stuff I've seen is for like parents identifying it in children but I'm an adult trying to help myself.",Telling the difference between ADHD v. Anxiety v. Depression

ADHD,"UPDATE AFTER TALKING: Read below for context. So we talked on the phone and it went about as horribly as I could have possibly imagined. It started off okay, I asked her some questions and told her I wasn't demanding an answer. It's all kind of a blur now but she basically told me that she was feeling the same connection I felt, up until we were about to have sex. I asked her if something happened that triggered a flashback. She took a long time to think and said that it probably wasn't a flashback. She told me that she just changed her mind after we were passionately kissing for twenty minutes. She said she's finicky and it causes emotional instability in other people. Those were her exact words and she said it while laughing. I was going to initially tell her off, but after talking to you guys I thought I would give her the benefit of the doubt. I did up until she said that.

For some added context, when we met we bonded over music, and she sent me this incredibly intense romantic song, right down the line by Gary Rafferty. I knew I was interested by then and her sending the song was kind of a fun little tease. I sent a love song back and we did that back and forth while getting to know each other. And every song she sent was the same: intense love song, no variation. Our first date we spent the entire day together. She brought me back to her house. I brought her to mine. She met my dad and we had dinner and laughed and talked until 10pm. At the end she told me she definitely wants to see me again. We were texting almost every day and by all indication she seemed at least interested in dating me. I asked her about that today and she tells me it was completely unintentional. The night before I asked her if I misread anything and she said no. But today it was all in my head. I'm not saying that I was expecting her to be my soulmate, but I didn't expect this either. It was like she was running hot this whole time and last night she switched to cold. 

It became clear to me that she didn't understand how damaging or confusing this was, especially because she kept laughing and her tone was like we were having a sunny afternoon chat. I tried to explain what happened to me the last time someone pulled a 180 on me like this (in the comments), how traumatic it was and she just kept saying the same three or four things over and over about how people are complicated, feelings change all the time etc, it's not her fault that I was hurt in the exact same way...she kept meandering and contradicting herself it felt like I was talking to a different person. As the conversation went on she just got more and more careless and kept laughing like it was a funny little misunderstanding. At this point I started breaking down, I told her that last night was one of my worst nightmares, and I wish I'd never met her. And then I hung up. 

Recounting this has caused something to resurface: last night we had drinks, and she was pretty quick to finish her drink. I've been known to put away a few so I didn't think anything of it. Sometime during or after dinner she mentioned that she used to be in a relationship with an alcoholic and it was very traumatic for her. This never once came up before, and both dates we drank together. I think something about us drinking and being intimate set her off. But according to her she just changed her mind, so I don't know. There were some other things I found kind of weird. When she sent me that love song deep down I wondered if that was too intense for someone to be sending a potential lover they just met. I mentioned in the comments that I'm Brazilian and coincidentally she happened to spend time in Brazil and speaks some Portuguese. Turns out it wasn't a coincidence-- when we matched she looked me up on LinkedIn and saw that I was Brazilian. Then she waited to tell me until we'd talked more and gotten closer. I guess that was a red flag. I don't know what to take way from this. I've been in situations before where I caught feelings for the other person and deep down I knew they didn't feel the same. Like no matter what I said outwardly I knew my feelings weren't fully reciprocated. But this is the first time it's happened with someone I was convinced felt the same. Who by all outward appearances was at least interested in giving it a shot with me. I don't know what I'm going to do at this point, because I'm so suggestible and have imposter syndrome I'm convinced that there's something wrong with me and no matter how good of a fit the next person seems it will end the same way. I actually don't think there is anyone who is a good fit for me anymore. Every woman who has rung that bell ended up changing her mind. It's happened three or four times now at varying stages of dating. 

TLDR: we talked about what happened on the phone, and she made it seem like what happened was a funny little mishap, like it was so silly I would even ask about it. I feel worse than I ever thought I could feel.  I have severe depression and anxiety issues in addition to the ADHD and I don't see a way out of this for me without a drastic personality change and that's not going to happen. I feel humiliated, pathetic, stupid, unwanted, gullible, and violated. And I have to go through this completely alone, trapped inside my house in the dead of winter. I give up.

ORIGINAL POST:

I'll try to keep this short. Right now I'm more heart broken I think than I've ever been. I met someone a few weeks ago, I'll call her C,  and when I say it felt like we were made for each other I mean it. Before I met her I was in a relationship for eight months and I felt closer to C in two weeks than I ever did with my ex.

This has happened before and it's always ended with me getting hurt. But in the past there was something I could pin point that at least gave me some clarity on what went wrong. I was too clingy, or I was neglectful, or she was giving off bad vibes...something. But with C, for the first time I felt that I clicked with someone who was as emotionally direct/honest as I am and who wasn't going to play games. She made it clear to me that she was catching feelings and I reciprocated. I thought it was going to be different this time because of the emotional honesty.

Last night we had our second date and it was perfect. We cooked dinner at her place and we had some drinks. No indication of anything wrong. We end up on the couch, undressing and kissing and after about 20 minutes she stops, gets up, stares off in silence for a while and then tells me she just realized she was wrong about how she felt about me. We talk some more and eventually she hands me clothes and I leave. She tells me we can't see each other anymore.

I don't understand any of this. Dating while being ND is scary enough but to have someone lure you into this fall sense of security...my entire reality is unraveling. And it keeps happening. This is just the worst one so far because I thought I found someone I could really be myself around, no mask. I'm 30 and I've been in one relationship that hasn't imploded in a couple months. I'm an absolute wreck right now and I don't know if anyone is even going to understand or reply to this. I don't even know if I'm making sense. It wouldn't be as bad except there's not a single person in my life emotionally equipped to talk me through this, not even my family. Even my therapist isn't the best at talking me through stuff like this. I don't know what to do. I just want to give up on life and become a vegetable.

If anyone out there can tell me anything other than ""just move on"" or ""you got attached too quick"" or anything that sounds remotely like NT dating advice please I'm begging you respond. I'm drowning in my own body.

TLDR: a lifetime of dating with ADHD has caused me to lose the ability to trust other people and my own feelings. The last straw was when a date I had with someone who I thought was the ""one"", who purposefully led me to believe that she was, ended with her realizing she felt nothing for me and kicking me out. Any support would help please.",How can I survive dating with ADHD?
ADHD,"Since high school my grades have always been a problem. I suffered from severe anxiety and depression that started in 8th (2008) grade, and it took years to finally find a solution. I figured my grades were slipping because my depression made me lazy and not care, even though getting bad grades caused a lot of anxiety for me. I went to an alternative high school my last year (2012) and I fell into a friend group that prioritized having fun over school, and my grades showed it. I found myself lying to my parents about my grades because I was so ashamed. I had gone from gifted and talented to basically a high school drop out. After graduating I started community college. My first semester I had a mental breakdown and dropped 2 out of 4 classes, and barely passed the other two. After that I continued to enroll due to pressure from my mom and my self, but always did poorly. I manned to pass classes but never with flying colors, and I always lied about my grades because I was ashamed. I’ve been going to community college since 2013, with gap semesters here and there. I have switched majors many times and did some trade school certifications. Last year though I finally found something I want to do and that I enjoy immensely; teaching!

At the start of COVID all my classes went online, and I struggled to barely pass. It was frustrating and infuriating because I had felt that I was actually doing better than past years.

When I started on anti-depressants he made me read all this info about all the negative side effects and what horrible long term effects I could have. It was rough and my mom tried to protect me from him the best she could. 

But that was 7+ years ago, and like I said our relationship has improved and I like to think he’s gotten more tolerant of mental health issues. I certainly don’t need to tell him about my diagnosis or medication, but he’s my dad and a big part of me wants him to know. I guess I’m just scared of the reaction. 

I called him yesterday just to chat, and I had every intention of bringing it up but then I just couldn’t. I’m considering bringing it up next time he comes to see me in person, I just don’t know if I’ll be able to. He might also be hurt that I’ve kept it from him.

ADHD,"I'm a senior in high school. (I haven't been officially diagnosed but I suspect I have ADHD and am currently in the waiting line to get diagnosed). This whole Covid-19 situation has thrown my schedule all out of the loop to the point where I can barely function. I'm trying to apply to colleges, but I've been putting it off for months. I'm trying to work on my art so I can work on my portfolio (which I enjoY DRAWING), yet my brain stops me from starting. I'm tired of this invisible barrier preventing me from moving forward.

ADHD,"Every day I remember to take my Concerta, I end up sleepy. Yesterday was full of energy and I was bouncing off the walls -- I felt alive. I had also forgotten to take my medication. Today I took my medication and, as I'm writing this, i have just finished an afternoon nap. I've been on Concerta for over a month. When i first took it a month and a half ago, the first thing I did was take a nap. Odd thing is, I normally never take naps.

Concerta makes me a more calm, collected person, but it also makes me tired. Is there a medication that worked better for you? Does going for a run or something like that help? Do you just get used to the calm feeling?",How do you deal with the sleepiness resulting from your medication?
ADHD,"Hi all! I was just wondering if anyone had any suggestions for how to deal with noise disturbances and  sound sensitivity. I notice that at nighttime I can focus way better, but I am also way more sensitive to sound, like every sound I hear just gets to me and distracts me. So does anyone have any suggestions on devices or tools one can use to have silence around them, so they can focus optimally (especially when that's the only time you can focus)? I don't have control over outside noises or anything and most of the time I have on headphones to help manage, but I also need absolute quiet sometimes and can't think with music on. Do you have favorite earplugs that work really well or anything like that? I'm willing to try anything - thank you ahead of time!

ADHD,"I always hear about others with ADHD having specific interest that they connect with or constant go back to, but I feel the opposite. While yes I have interest and hobbies I often feel I have to pretend that they are as important to me as others do. Almost like I’m mirroring their excitement for the things they deeply enjoy with things I just kinda like. The same goes for hobbies I might like something like music or doing an activity and then I see someone with the same interest and I’m like “wow they are really into this thing like they really enjoy it and honestly I like it but I could live without it”. It’s not quite imposter symptom because I don’t feel like a poser I am more just upset that I can’t like something with as much passion as they do. 

An example is I know a lot of ppl who can watch the same movie/show over and over again because it’s their favorite, but I really can’t do that. No matter how much I like a show I rarely will rewatch it unless it’s with someone else or there has been enough time for me to forget it. Sometimes I will be into a certain thing but at most it will last a week then I never pick it up again and when ppl talk about it I might know about it, but I have no interest in relating to them about the topic. In general I feel like I only bring up my “interests” because people are suppose to have them. 

A lot of this might be because I never have the energy to dive into anything and instead just skim the surface of everything I enjoy. I deal with other disorders as well and this could be related to them instead, but I do really feel this is related to my ADHD. 

Does anyone else feel this way?",Anyone struggle with feeling like they can’t keep up with hobbies/interested?

ADHD,"Background: I'm currently in the process of getting diagnosed, just started this process a few months ago because my coping mechanisms fell apart with lock down. I have been highly suspicious of having ADHD for several years now though. 

So my entire life I've always just tried to explain to people how I am in ways that are basic - I get distracted easily, I'm sensitive to my surroundings, I have to exercise (run) regularly or I get restless, my mind never shuts up...  so things like that. 

So what I want to know is how do you deal with people who are dismissive of your symptoms without revealing your medical history? I mentioned at work that I get seasonal depression and a coworker said ""oh everyone gets sad in the winter"" and I wanted to shout at her that I had to go to a doctor and get a prescription for it because I was in a competely dark place with no joy at all. Another time,  I was trying to explain to someone why I have trouble working on boring projects, the absolutely crippling mind block that occurs, and complete paralyzation and they respond ""but everyone procrastinates sometimes"". I wouldn't call attempting to work on stunting for hours and your brain stopping you ""procrastination"". Same with light and sound sensitivity: ""listen to music"" - which is also distracting, I need quiet, but not too quiet so noise blocking headphones are out!  Enough examples...

I've just sort of reached my limit for my tolerance of these kind of BS answers. I know they aren't being malicious but it's like they're not even listening. I don't bother trying to explain it to people whose understanding isn't going to impact my life but what if it's a work manager? Or a friend or relative?

I don’t know how to make my brain work more efficiently and to get more done.

ADHD,"It’s so demotivating. I was so proud of myself because I’ve been able to get work done using some 10 minute YouTube video ADHD timers and listening to loud music. I also have been gamifying tasks (can you finish writing that email before this song ends?). And so far, it has actually worked! I’m getting things done and I’m excited about it.

All this effort, all this conscious research to improve myself to fit in with the neurotypical expectations... yet no one really expects me to do well anymore. I don’t get a thank you at work for going the extra mile today. My boss worries that I can’t finish this or can’t take on that. She doesn’t want me to do anything I am actually excited to do in fear that I might not finish on time or get overwhelmed. I excitedly describe my wins and they bring me back to “but don’t do ___ or you won’t be able to finish”.

It’s so discouraging. I know it’s just external things that shouldn’t affect me and all that but I get a pang of social rejection with each negative reaction that slights all my hard efforts. This probably lowers dopamine, is my guess. Because my motivation is lower with each instance and I feel literal pain.

ADHD,"My boyfriend has not dealt with CVS until recently, after we moved. However, I have and *my GOD* they really get a kick out of being difficult and lying straight to customers. Does anyone have any possible solution they could recommend? Any similar experience?

It goes like this: 

* His doctor prescribes him 3x30mg Adderall IR/day;30 days (generic)
* Last month insurance denied it but he knew it would (bc over 60mg) 
* The pharmacist gave him two options:
* 1.) Pay for it all out of pocket  ***or***  2.) She'll give him the 2/3 of his script that's covered, then he can call doctor and request a separate script for remaining 1/3 that month.
* He decides to pay out of pocket for full script this time, with GoodRX, to avoid complications
* **Polite** pharmacist then recommends that his doctor send in two separate scripts next time: 2x30mg and 1x30mg. That way at least 2/3 is covered and 1/3 out of pocket. Cool! Super helpful\~
* Next appointment, his doctor recommends the same thing the pharmacist said, independently.
* Doctor sends in two scripts. He picks up first 2/3 of script (2x30mg)
* 4 days later, CVS sends ""ready for pickup"" notification to his app for remaining third. (1x30mg) 
* He calls before heading out, just to double check before driving up.
* **Rude** Pharmacist *decides* she can't authorize it, even though it was ""ready for pickup/filled"". She was really not having it, you could hear it in her voice.
* He explains the situation, points out last month's dose of 3x30mg to show her that this was indeed intentional, and she doesn't care, says his doctor did it wrong, *no he didn't hun*. **The doctor ordered this.** 
* He stated that he's only going by what the doctor and pharmacist said was the best way to go about this. 
* She calls him a liar, essentially, and that no pharmacist said to do that. *(Yes she did. I was there.)*
* She said he can't receive any more for next 30 days. 
* I know for a fact that there is nothing stopping them from allowing him to pay out of pocket.
* She decides to be a b\*\*\*\* and hold his prescription after the phone call ended, it was not on hold before that call. Web page was open the entire time. I just laugh when it flips to ""hold"" *So typical*

 Is there anything he can do about this? He messaged his doctor but it seems like doctor's with medical degrees don't make decisions at CVS pharmacy.

 I have dealt with this before, and know that pharmacists have the right to deny whatever they want depending on their ""mood"".

Last month a fly somehow got stuck in my hair and I could hear it buzzing in my ear and I almost cried from how much it freaked me out.

I'm the only one in my family with this problem, all my family members can easily crush them no problem. If someone else is in the house and I see a bug, I usually call them to kill it. 

If no one else is around so I have to be the one to kill it? Well, this is maybe where I'm wondering if anyone else has to do this. I first have to put on headphones and play really loud music so that I can't hear the bug buzz/crunch, I wad up a HUGE amount of tissues/paper towel to crush it, enough that I won't be able to feel it at all.

There’s no course study guide, just prescribed textbook readings which can range anywhere from 1-3 chapters (per subject) plus lectures, on campus tutorials, online unit content readings and little extra readings thrown in here and there.

I don't have a super hard time remembering appointments/meetings/dates, but I am constantly forgetting to bring things I need with me.

It is so exhausting to constantly have to go back and forth because I've forgotten something. My boyfriend gets kind of frustrated when it takes me 3 tries to actually leave the house because I have to keep going back in. Also, forgetting my wallet kills me. Sometimes it is on my desk at home because I bought something online, or I changed bags and forget to switch it over. It is so embarrassing to go get food with people and realize I've forgotten my wallet. Or worse. The grocery store with a cart full of groceries... so humiliating.

People tell me to put a checklist on my door, but I am only ever thinking about that when I'm in the middle of going back to get something, and I'm already late and flustered at that point.

I picked up a few tools from my time actively participating in a Buddhist group that greatly helped me manage my rejection sensitivity. As rejection sensitivity is fairly prevalent amongst individuals with ADHD, I thought I would share it here in the hopes that it might help someone else.

Whenever I start to feel rejected by someone, I stop, sit if I can, close my eyes if it is safe to do so, take a few slow deep breaths and ask myself a series of questions:

Am I actually being rejected or is my brain being a fuck?

If I'm actually being rejected, am I being rejected because I did something wrong or that hurt this person, or are they being a fuck?

If I did something wrong or that hurt this person, what can I do in the future to try and prevent this from happening again? (also apologize for doing whatever it was that you did. Do not try to explain the why unless it is extremely necessary, like did the right thing for their safety but still hurt them, so that they are aware of the danger. Otherwise leave it at hey I did this thing and I recognize that it hurt you and I'm sorry.) You can sometimes follow this up with a conversation with the person where you agree on techniques that may help mitigate this thing happening again in the future as often times these things tend to be caused by misunderstandings in communication.

ANYWAY. I just got prescribed again but at a 20mg dose. Knowing about my prior use, I thought this was going to be a perfect dose plus I haven’t been on an stimulant for 2 years so I I’d assume my body would be refreshed......

This happened to be the same week my midterm had been rescheduled to and because I haddn't been checking my e-mails or going to online lectures I ended up missing the entire midterm.

Could really use some advice. I've been doing ok-ish in this class, the professor is really difficult and sets a lot of high expectations (none of them are unreasonable I'm just having a hard time keeping up) and I just realized that the midterm I thought was today was actually last week.

I really can't stand online classes anymore, its so easy to just skip the lectures and say ""eh I'll watch it later"" and then realize that one you skipped had vital information on the rescheduling of your midterm from one date to another.

Not only this but because I haven't had any classes in person its been even more difficult for me to form any connections with my peers in this course who could have told me that the midterm was moved.

I know this all just sounds like me feeling sorry for myself, and i guess it is, but I'm just trying not to lose my mind thinking about how I just wasted my parents money for this entire semester since that midterm was about 25% of my grade.

I also posted this on r/CasualConversation, but what I didn't say in that post is that this midterm happened at the worst possible moment. We had  a huge winter storm and all classes were closed for the entire week due to power outages. This set our schedule back a week and as such this set the midterm back.

Then, the following week, I run out of my ADHD medication. I ask to get it refilled and it takes the pharmacy ***an entire damn week*** to refill the prescription. In hindsight I really should have put the order in ***before*** I ran out but it is what it is. So I was without my prescription for all of last week which ruined my sleep schedule and my normal organization system.

Thus I missed a bunch of lectures and e-mails all of which would have told me that the midterm date had been moved.

And so here I find myself, 4 days away from spring break wondering how I'm going to tell my parents that I missed an entire midterm due to my own incompetence.

The reason why I didn't say any of this in r/CasualConversation is because I don't want people to think I'm trying to blame this all on my ADHD. Honestly I don't know where to place the blame for this, it all just seems to be like the perfect storm.","Just realized the midterm I thought was today was actually last week and I didn't even realize it, tell me why I shouldn't be losing my mind"
ADHD,"Not looking for a diagnosis (have an appointment for that on Monday) but currently fixating on the idea I might have add and am looking for another opinion. 

To start, I should mention I am 26f, diagnosed depression/anxiety and have been taking Zoloft for the past 6 months which has all but annihilated my anxiety/depression and with that my ability to focus/get things done. I had assumed most of my problems were related to these things. That is when I came to the idea I might have ADD inattentive type. 

I’ve always been quiet, introverted, and socially anxious. As a kid I was the top of my class in school, did well on tests, and turned in homework on time. I didn’t speak in class/was well behaved, other than daydreaming in class a lot. I did forget my homework/other things quite often, and felt like I had to study harder/longer than others to be successful. I procrastinated but got things done, often the night before it was due. I had MAJOR anxiety around school in elementary/middle/high school, to the point I would cry if I got anything less than a B. So I was always able to push myself to do homework and study. 

Friendships were mostly fine, however I had a hard time maintaining them unless I saw my friends in person. After school I preferred to play video games instead of hang out with other kids. Often, during school breaks/weekends, I would play video games all day for days at a time, or read books like Harry Potter straight through until I finished them. 

I’ve always been an “airhead”, organized chaos in my bedroom and forgetful/losing important things. I have trouble organizing myself and my thoughts, and telling stories. I have considered it part of my personality. 

I also play with my hair constantly, and bite my cheeks. In situations where I’m bored, like church or a work meeting, I feel an intense need to be done and go move around, always looking at the clock. 

In college, I completely fell apart academically. I took an extra year, and did poorly on most assignments since I never could pay attention in class. Without structure, I couldn’t get myself to study or pay attention in class. Ever. I started every semester with motivation to take notes each lecture and start assignments early but could only do that for the first week. My grades heavily depended on acing final exams. I would study for hours in the library but spent most of the time browsing the Internet or talking to friends. 

As an employee today, I feel the same way. Unless there is an imminent deadline I procrastinate on my work and cannot pay attention in meetings or 1:1s with my manager. At home, I am struggling with my boyfriend being very neat and clean and I need to have things out where I will remember them. I forget things a lot when I’m leaving the house and I can’t keep in touch with friends long distance as I forget about their existence. 

Additionally, I fixate on ideas for weeks at a time. One moment it’s skiing, the next it’s changing my hair, or buying stocks. I impulsively spend on things relating to my current fixation. Once I accomplish or receive whatever it is, I move on to something else. I’ve lost control of my spending as an adult. 

I think the fact that I was successful in school before age 12 (and my parents/teachers/friends can corroborate that) might be an indicator that I don’t have it? I seem to have a lot of the symptoms and reading others’ stories on here makes me feel heard. But I am really struggling as an adult and really need help.

Edit: tldr; i am struggling as an adult from what I thought was anxiety/depression, but I have fixed that and I identify with inattentive ADHD. I did well in school as a kid and my symptoms became more apparent later in life. Wondering if I actually have it or not.",ADD but did well in school growing up?
ADHD,"My psychiatrist wants me to take days off my medication but right now with having just bought a house that’s not working out. I felt like crap before meds and I do again any day I try to not take them. The best I’ve done is a quarter of the max dose I’m prescribed right now. It’s so hard to try to not take my meds when they’re the one thing that seems to help me do what I plan to do, especially when I’m very busy and it involves a lot of focusing.

I cried everytime as we pulled up at the clinic. My mom had to crawl around in the garden with me, otherwise I just wouldn't be interested in moving.

But then we went to the beach and all of a sudden I wanted to move around. I moved around so much, in fact, that I had scratches everywhere from the damn sand.

ADHD,"I had an assessment today and the lady didn’t think I have adhd, she said I have dyslexia, dysgraphia and some cognitive problems/ processing issues. I’m 23 now but when I was 13 another very fancy/ famous psychologist said the same thing, he also said I scored very high on the inattention scale but he didn’t want to diagnose me for some strange reason, maybe because I’m not hyper active but that doesn’t mean I don’t have the inattentive type. 

I am so absolutely certain that I have adhd, I feel it every day in everything I do. If I just have dyslexia then why does the exact problem I feel while reading and writing effect my motivation, relationships, ability to do basic things like keep clean and get things done, deadlines, focus, motivation, dopamine deficiency, substance abuse, obsessions, brain fog, short lived hyper focus before zombifying, etc etc etc?????

I’m having another assessment later this month by a different person to double check and if she doesn’t diagnose me with adhd I don’t know what I’ll do. I will ask her to still be referred to an adhd specialist regardless of her diagnosis because I want to be absolutely sure. I’ve always had all the symptoms of adhd especially as a child, I was diagnosed with it at some point but different psychologists all disagreed.

ADHD,"Hello wonderful community of r/adhd! 
My psychiatrist and I are 90% sure that i have adhd. Since I was a kindergartener my mom used to tell me to stop staring out the window off into the distance daydreaming. I almost always pace around the subway platform while I wait for the train and tap my foot at blast beat speeds in class and at home. I am impulsive and get caught up in the moment very often, especially with video games. I used to play rust and 3 hours would go by like it was nothing which is why I stopped playing it because I would get sucked in for too long. There have also been some moments at school where i did something i regretted because I acted on my impulses, usually embarrassing myself in front of class mates. 

Edit:i actually really relate to some of the posts here in r/adhd just wanted to point that out.

I am in 12th grade and was diagnosed with depression last year, and my life went to shit for a while and now i don't feel depressed anymore but i still can't focus. I thought it mightve been the depression, but like i said i don't feel depressed or suicidal anymore and i workout now and get actual sleep(i used to have insomnia for a few months) and i just feel better than ever except i still can't get my homework done.

ADHD,"I started taking Concerta again on Sunday after 4 or 5 years off of it (I stopped taking it because I thought I didn't need it after dropping out of college, one less thing to pay for) when my ADHD symptoms were starting to become harder to manage and it started to effect my social life.

But I don't remember Concerta making me this jumpy or anxious when I was growing up. On Sunday (day one) I was playing Minecraft, doing some menial tasks, very low impact when suddenly my skin started to crawl. 

Monday I went to work and was a little more hyper than normal. I didn't want to stand still and my mouth didn't stop moving. Tuesday I crashed REALLY hard around 5pm and got very lethargic/ depressed and easily agitated. 

Then today I was watching over my back all day, ready to jump out of my skin at any given moment. I managed to work through a minor panic attack around 7 am but the panicky feeling didn't go away till I got home and closed my eyes at 4 pm

ADHD,"I was diagnosed with adhd when I was young and took Ritalin for years before I stopped once I finished my degree. Sometime after I started working I was prescribed anti-depressants and I almost cried. I’d been down for years and it really felt like a life line. After having my dosage progressively ramped up to the maximum dose I’ve slowly managed to pull my shit together and create some stability (since anti depressants it’s taken about 5 years). 

Given that I have the feel of relative stability and happiness I considered the long term effects of the pills and with permission from the doctor started reducing the dose from 200mg to 150mg to 100mg and I onto 50mg next before.... 

How have you found stopping pills with adhd? I’ve only recently found this thread and learning so much about the condition I was diagnosed with as a child, and still undoubtedly have! I’d be really grateful for any of the experiences of this you can share.

ADHD,"I have not been officially diagnosed with ADHD but I have always had problems with procrastination, starting tasks, staying focused, etc. as well as with excessive daytime sleepiness. I have started uni this year and those things have been making my life much more difficult. After multiple attempts to deal with those problems without any medication, my psychiatrist prescribed me 20g of Medikinet (methylphenidate hydrochloride) which is often used to help people with ADHD. I am going to be honest, I was a bit concerned at first about the side effects, becoming dependent, and all that stuff. 

But holy crap, after taking the drug I felt so much better. My head was clear and I was actually able to focus on what I needed to do. I have also noticed that it helped with my anxiety and overthinking, which allowed me to be more social in certain situations. Since then I have been taking the pills on days I knew I was going to need to be productive and stay focused and it has been working out fine.

Now it has been a couple of months since I have been prescribed the meds and I have noticed that their effects are way weaker than before or sometimes even negligible. My thoughts run ramped just as much as before, staying on track is difficult and what's worse is that I have had situations when I felt sleepy after taking the drug, which is the main thing that it was supposed to help me with. Honestly, I'm kinda worried about it because the meds have really helped and allowed me to feel a bit more ""normal"" I guess.

Since then I started to try a lot of coping strategies, try to understand my own head, and in general, try to treat it on my own. When i realized I couldn't and it was only getting worse i asked for my mom's help. She managed to get me to a therapist and my therapist was awesome! She helped a lot to understand who I was and what is adhd and that it is a part of me and not some other thing. But ever since the start she said that as soon as I could i should go to a psychiatrist. 

Well it took a long time, but after I insisted a lot my mom managed to get me there too. Yesterday I was diagnosed officially and got my prescription. Today I got my pills. 

I am yet to take any, but everyone that i talked about it, friends, family, everybody answer to me like I was going to use crack or something just because I want to take ""the easy route"" like I was going after some happy pills i didn't need because big pharma told me to. And God this is awful. It feels like I'm doing something wrong, like i didn't try anything. Everybody keep talking to me like ""but that was the first thing you tried"" and no, that wasn't. I tried going out more. But i barely have enough energy to do that. I tried making those planners and such but i kept forgetting to put things in them, I tried talking to you for god sake but you wouldn't listen and just shut me down.

ADHD,"My whole life, My Brand™️ of ADHD has involved getting so hyperfocused on one task (or a series of tasks) that I totally forget to care for myself in simple ways - usually this manifests as not eating or preparing food for myself, or subsisting off of snacks and easily available food, like a banana and a glass of milk, for an entire day. Or doing nothing but drinking water and coffee until late into my day. Hell, just yesterday I took a moment to think and realized I hadn't eaten in slightly over 20 hours. It manifests really hard as shakes, anxiety, anger, etc - all emotional disregulation I already struggle with, so forgetting to eat throws a HUGE wrench into my mental stability. In turn, it makes it even more difficult to remember to eat. Even if I don't count sleeping, I still sometimes go 8 to 10 hours consuming nothing but water and coffee because the feeling of my stomach being \*physically* full is enough to let me forget to eat. 

But my wonderful girlfriend has been constantly reminding me to eat, and after a full two-plus years of being together, it's finally starting to click. She's out of state right now, so it's up to me to remember to make food even if I'm struggling, and while I'm only up to maybe *one* solid meal a day, two if I remember / have the energy, it's a big step away from just... *not eating* if there's nobody around to make food for me.

ADHD,"Warning: This is long, but I broke it down in bullets to make it easier to read. You can delete if it's too much.

So, I've been for two sessions, finishing my second yesterday and have to wait maybe 2 weeks for the results. The first session was going over my history from childhood to adulthood. It was pretty long and in depth and made me second guess myself to the extreme since I don't really remember having too many defining symptoms as a kid. My teenage/high school years are a blur of depression, trouble making, a few misdiagnoses, and being overly medicated to the point where I was asleep most of the time and my memory is shot. I didn't end up going the conventional route in school since I really couldn't but still got my GED a year before my class graduated and was able to get my diploma through a special program as long as I worked until my class graduated. 

Anyway, it brought up a lot of emotions. After the grueling questioning, I had to take a test on the computer where letters would pop up on a stark white screen in different intervals and I had to press the space bar every time they popped up except for the letter ""X"". The screen was so white I had to look more at the bottom of the screen and look out of my peripherals. It was interesting and very boring. He gave me some other tests to take home and fill out. PAI test(?) and another questionnaire asking me questions about how I view myself, parents, peers, emotions. That one was kind of dark but I can see how useful it could be. I told him it was stressful fill out. The way he explained it made me think maybe I would also be getting some more general mental diagnosis for problems I have. That would be very helpful. 

I went in yesterday for my second session. It was maybe 3 hours of testing and I was so exhausted and drained afterwards. I'm pretty sure these aren't in order of how they were given.

1st- I had red/white blocks with the different sides either being one color or both split. With those I had to reproduce the shape on the paper in a certain amount of time. Pretty easy as I am a visual person. I missed the last one though, almost had it. I stared at the paper for a second after knowing I could have/should have gotten it. \*Brain cues anxiety\*

2nd- I had to repeat the numbers he said to me in order it was said. Then in hierarchy from 0-9. I closed my eyes to visualize which helped quite a bit. Also tapped my fingers to recall which number was said with what finger I tapped. Maybe a few I blanked on. When my anxiety kicks in it sometimes my thoughts are like a marker on a dry erase board. It's blank again with a quick swipe.

3rd- He read two words and I had to describe the similarities in them. I got most but a few I just couldn't express them in words. I understand how they are similar, I just couldn't say it. \*Down we go again\*. 

4th- I had to define words, same thing. \*Dumb dumb, why can't you find your words? You know exactly what they mean and how to use them.\* 

5th- I had to find the pattern in different shapes and color formations with with one tile being blank to fill in with the options below. The more intricate ones were very hard to focus on to find the pattern. Again, visual person, why can't I get this? The time, the pressure, my anxiety. I made the best guesses on some and made it obvious I was guessing. 

6th-I was given two shapes that were different colors. Below, were probably 10 or so lines with the two shapes and two colors. I had to mark the ones that were the same as the two examples given as fast as I could until he said stop. I accidentally marked a few wrong and I know I missed a few. A couple I realized I missed as soon as a passed them and marked after. Calling myself dumb under my breathe as I mess up. With the mask on, I'm not sure if he heard me or not. We did that a few different times. 

7th- I was given the numbers 0-9 with a shape or lines being underneath. There were probably at least 20 lines of numbers with a fill in the blank box underneath to fill in the shape associated with the number. Again, as fast as a could. I don't know how I did. There was an arrow pointing upwards for one and I kept accidentally writing an A on impulse. Same with maybe one or two others. But, for the most part I think I did okay. 

8th- Mathematical word problem with no scratch paper. Not fantastic at math but none of them were very hard. But again, I didn't have a piece of paper to write the numbers down. I can do the math in my head. I just needed paper to keep the numbers straight for the multi step ones. He was allowed to repeat them once which was nice. I flubbed a few times when I got nervous and couldn't keep the math straight in my head. There was also someone talking outside the office and I would lose any train of thought. I finally said something. Felt like an idiot. They give these questions to kids I assume. 

9th- This might have been the final one. He would say numbers and letters which I would have to repeat but put the in order starting with the letters and followed by the numbers, A-Z 0-9. Finger taps again and eyes closed. The more intricate ones I'm pretty sure I flubbed.

To be honest, I was almost in tears through a lot of it. I could feel my eyes start to water and worked hard to keep it in check. I don't like feeling like an idiot and I'm really hard on myself. I get sensitive when I'm wrong. Especially if I know I could have gotten the answer. I went to my favorite bar with my favorite bartender and had a shot and a beer to ease the nerves before going home. I just didn't want to be alone with my thought quite yet. When I got home and my husband got done with work we talked and I just started ugly crying and hyperventilating. I just felt so f\*\*\*ing stupid and I apologized so many times to him for being so stupid and everything else I do to make his life harder. It was hard to even look him in the eyes. I don't think I did the entire time. I kept covering my face with my blanket so he couldn't look at me. I didn't want to be looked at. He calmed me down and made me lay on the couch and I took an anxiety/allergy pill to make me sleepy. I realize that I'm very anxious and hard on myself. But, did anyone else feel this way? I would hope not everyone goes through this after the test. Maybe I don't have adhd and I'm just anxious and dumb.

ADHD,"So, because I don't want to be wasteful, and am forever renting, I always have to rely on a Brita filter.

Thankfully, my partner is ok with leaving the giant jug right there on the counter next to the sink (I can't imagine going back and forth to the fridge. I don't even like cold water.)  so the process to fill it is that I pull the faucet hose out, stick it in the top of the filter and turn on the water. Seems easy enough right?

wrong.

The amount of time it takes to fill is about the exact amount of time it takes for my brain to be on a new task in the far side of the apartment where I can't hear when it inevitably is flooding my kitchen.

ADHD,"I've been on Ritalin for a year now. On the standard version from 5mg all the way to 20mg, then on the modified release version starting with 20mg and now 30mg.

The thing is I've been building resistance to it very quickly. It got slower with higher dosages but remains an issue. The 30mg would work for 7h for the first month, but over time it became 5h, then 3h and finally something around 1h40.

Because of this my doctor wants to add some emotion regulators to me treatment. So that I can feel better on the days I don't need to work/focus and so that I use the Ritalin less often and stop building resistance (I'm not a fan of his approach, he thinks that meds should only be taken when I need to work, so I've been heavily insisting that it's only half the problem).

But where will I be in another year or 2? It's pretty obvious that I'll keep building more and more resistance to the substance and will need more for it to get the same results. And the same probably goes for the regulators.

So how is this issue resolved? (Specifically in countries where only one type of medication is available?)

Does this mean that I actually don't have ADHD and that a mix of PTSD/anxiety/depression is what's wrong with my head?",How is the resistance building issue resolved in the long term?

It's all self guided work and experimentation going towards my eventual thesis. The project scope I want to work on are also these huge, expansive, research-heavy things.

I'm on XR adderall and started CBT. 

Do you have any similar experiences? If so how do you deal?",It almost hurts my brain to focus?
ADHD,"So I've finally started taking ADHD medication for the past month. I have an appointment with my doctor today and have plenty of questions to ask.

First of all, it seems to work. I can focus on mundane tasks, and at the same I don't feel the urge to abandon hard tasks. It allows me to have a fully productive workday, and that's exactly what I asked for.

But then there are the issues.

First, it gets me a little ""cloudy"" and agitated (shaking legs, some strange body sensations, some difficulty reading) for a bit before the calming effects get noticeable. Is this normal? Like, I take 20mg Ritalin LA at 10am, and will feel a little agitated until around 10h45, when I'll start feel calm and focused. By 11am, after I'm completely focused at work, it goes away. By 1pm it's the perfect spot. I feel like a normal, capable human being. No rushes, no shaking legs, no strange body sensations, just peaceful. Could this be because the dosage is high or low? I don't remember feeling that on Ritalin IR, but I felt it throughout the days when I took only 10mg of Ritalin LA. After upping to 20mg, now I only feel it at the beginning like I described.

Second, I already had IBS, and Ritalin seems to make it so much worse. From what I've read, it seems like my body isn't processing fat properly: feces get yellowish, and there's a bit of ""oil/fat"" in there too. Having a stricter diet, reducing carbs and eating more fiber (fruits, vegetables, etc) seem to fix this, but I just couldn't gather enough data to know for sure if it's a definite solution or not (I also have no way to guarantee that I'll be able to keep a healthy diet in the future, some times we have to go through bread and rice for some days because we have no time to do groceries).

Third is the crash. Holy shit, the crash is though. It starts at around 4pm and it feels unbearable. My body hurts, my muscles feel tense, I can't focus on anything, I get sad, fatigued and unmotivated. Talking a walk helps a bit, laying still in a dark room, eating something, etc. These all help to an extent, but don't fix it completely. I've not managed to take a nap because I feel like if I'll end up sleeping too much and then will be unable to sleep at bedtime.

The problem with the crash is mostly in days I have appointments or chores around that time. If I'm in a meeting I just feel like a useless, dumb cabbage, unable to process anything or contribute to anything. I don't even feel like playing video games with the kids because I'm irritated and don't want them to feel the bad vibes. The other day I was in a ""tough conversation"" with my boss when it started and I can only imagined what it might have looked like to her to see me going from 100 to 0 in half an hour. Until now I have avoided taking it the days I have therapy because I don't want to go there in the middle of a crash. Today I took it even though I have my doctors appointment later, and I think it'll be fun to talk to him like this.

The doc said I could try taking a IR pill to push the crash a little bit later and it does work, but makes the delayed crash more intense, and I feel like a drug abuser or something, taking more of it just to keep the high. I did exactly this yesterday, then crashed from 6h30pm until 8h30pm, had a strange night where I didn't know if I was awake or not, and woke up with sore muscles.

Also if I don't time the IR pill perfectly, I get some nice 30 minutes of weird cloudy shaky feelings (like I described in first point) until it settles in.

So my question to y'all is: is that normal? Will it subside with time? Is the dosage too low or too high? Should I try other medications? Ritalin is cheap and manageable (I can time LA + IR usage), I haven't tried Concerta, Vyvanse is too expensive and that's about all the options my doc gave me.","Finally prescribed ADHD medication, have some questions"
ADHD,"(TL;DR at the end)  
After my diagnosis, and even before it when I first started to actively suspect that I had *something* going on with me, not necessarily ADHD, but something. I've always been an odd character, but truthfully I just thought I had issues and/ or I was ""dramatic"" (I was called that ALL the time growing up).

But since my diagnosis I've thought about it more and MORE.  
Like HOW did absolutely NONE of my family go ""Hmm, maybe this kid got something going on?"".  
I'm 22 now, so I get it, mental health and stuff less of a focus point in my younger years, neurological conditions more shamed upon I guess? My family love me so I hold no anger towards them, but it could have made my teen years a lot less horrid.

But like, I was an ODD child, my year 6 teach once described me as ""Hyper intelligent but struggles with the most basic things"", giving a verbal answer was so easy, but writing something down I found almost impossible, I still have difficulty writing, and it's so messy, I go over letters and words and it is just so baddd.

But like, my mood swings were insane, generally a happy kid, but I cried a lot, and my temper was (and still is) very intense, thankfully after years of learning to control it it's a lot less of an issue these days.  
I'd over stim and get told off for it so I adapted playing with my hands or twiddling my clothing to keep me distracted, something I do to this day actually, really can't shake the habit (I now twiddle my beard).  
Struggled to make and maintain friendships, bounced between interests, struggled with expressing how I felt, the whole lot.

Idk, just something I wanted to get off my chest really, maybe see if anyone else felt the same way.  
If so please tell me your stories, I'd be really interested! :)

TL;DR - How the heck did none of my family get me tested as a kid, my ADHD is as obvious as an elephant walking through New York.",How did no one notice??
ADHD,"\[20 y/o M\]

Hi all, recently got my ADHD diagnosis and was excited to head to a psychiatrist and start medication. Beforehand, I obsessively researched a lot of medications like Adderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse, Concerta.

After I discussed my symptoms and diagnosis with my psychiatrist, she decided to prescribe me Strattera. I didn't even know what that was, but I assumed it was something similar to Vyvanse because she said it was a less addictive medication than something like Adderall.

After the meeting ended (because she really didn't give me any time to ask questions), I went ahead and researched Strattera and... I'm just so confused. Everywhere I look says it is only supposed to be a second-line medication if stimulants don't work. And it takes about a month for it to start working? And there are hundreds of side effects especially during that first month? And it's significantly less effective at treating ADHD than stimulants?

I don't know, I was just so confused. I'm literally not going to fill that prescription because I honestly don't want it. I'm in school right now and I have too much going own to afford a whole bunch of side effects for a month.

What should I do? Just get a new psychiatrist? I'm really bummed out because I had to wait a whole month to meet with that one.  

Edit: I'm in the US",Is it common for psychiatrists to prescribe Strattera as first treatment?
ADHD,"Today, I visited a therapist for the first time after years of depression, anxiety and now what I might be suspecting is inattentive ADHD.  The therapy appointment was okay; I don't expect much since it was the first visit, and I tend to be closed off, so I know I'm going to have to work on being more open and getting help.

After the session, I have scheduled three more therapy appointments for every other week and a psychiatry appointment for next week. Now, I'm just nervous about the psychiatric selection. I don't want to seem like a drug-seeker (which would be funny to be labeled as because my family and I hate taking prescribed medicine). However, when I bring up the possibility of ADHD, I'm scared the psychiatrist will think I only want Adderall to help me study or something.

I've already determined that I want to be on a combo of Wellbutrin and Adderall. Just on research I've done on my depression/anxiety and suspected ADHD. But again, I do not want to seem like I'm trying to abuse these drugs or something.

ADHD,"For the longest time I was feeling unemployable. I have ADHD and depression, most likely amplified by the pandemic too. Applied to hundreds of jobs, took several interviews and took too many rejections. My interviewing skills suffered because of my ADHD. Fidgeting, stuttering (and saying ummm... A LOT) twitching, scanning the room constantly instead of making eye contact, mind wandering and being unable to recall information on the spot (even after countless rehearsals) were just a few of the symptoms that held me back. Before I got diagnosed I got very close to landing a job at home depot, and they even interviewed me 3 times basically telling me I had the job, and then boom, no contact for weeks until I recieved an email telling me I was rejected. If that didn't make me feel unemployable, I don't know what would. 

But since I got diagnosed back in January and getting on the right medication, I was able to fix a lot of these problems! Not all, but a lot of them. I got my first interview since my diagnosis and I ACED IT! They contacted me the next day, and the next thing I knew I was signing the job offer and began online training. I couldn't be happier! Not only was being unemployed for so long making me suffer and feel worthless, it made my mentality suffer and therefore the people around me like my wife. 

I am still nervous as I will be going into a new area of work which is sales. I heard people with ADHD are natural salesmen, but I'm not sure if thats the case for the inattentive type (though I do have hyperactive tendencies as described above). Anyone here a sales associate?

ADHD,"I (24F) got a referral from my GP last year as I was struggling and needed help. He referred me (as he did a questionnaire and said it's most likely I have ADD) to the Primary Care Team who assess and diagnose ADD/ADHD. I finally got to see the psychiatrist (60s?F) today after a few months wait. She went through my whole childhood with myself and my mother. I have a LOT of traits from ADHD (hyper focus, spacing out, terrible memory, forgetting how to form sentences, picking up hobbies and leaving them, impulsiveness, talking over people/ending their sentence, constant need to fidget, can't carry out simple instructions, unable to listen or take in words, losing my possessions, careless mistakes/reading over stuff, easily distracted and cannot focus in conversations, excessive talking) that are making my life a train wreck and I opened up and told her everything, showed her my notes, told her about how I had a bad time in education and doing daily tasks.

The reasons she said I don't have ADHD are:

* I was not bouncing off the wall when I was a child, like most boys (I was quiet and reserved) and kept comparing me to my male cousin with ADHD.
* I had friends and socialised (I was the quiet one who just listened to everyone and usually then just stopped talking to them, failed to keep up social relationships).
* I got through education and I'm now doing a difficult course (I had the worst attendance through Primary and Secondary School, barely passing my GCSEs and dropping out during A-Levels. I'm now going into Final Year in University this September and I have struggled the whole way through).
* I have generalised anxiety disorder so there's no way it can be ADHD (My anxiety is situational and usually only when I'm travelling or it's something unknown and unfamiliar so it doesn't stay around on a daily basis).

She seems to think because I have GAD, my mind is over-working and it's leading to the same traits as ADHD. 

I am suffering **every day** and University has made it more prevalent. My two closes female friends along with my dad seem to think I need a second opinion from someone who specialises in female ADHD. I really hate how the only characteristics they ever consider is hyperactivity and have bad grades from education. Should I get a second opinion or go private? I'm feeling so hopeless after that appointment.

**TL;DR** Mature doctor compared my childhood to boys and hyperactivity. Says I can't have ADHD if I'm smart and have made it this far. Diagnosed me with GAD and says I'm emotionally unstable. Gave me a referral for therapy to control my emotions. What should I do?",Disappointed with my official NHS assessment results
ADHD,"Just a word of warning to everyone just starting their meds. This euphoria you're feeling in your first week or even month isn't going to last. You're high right now because of all the new chemicals that haven't become the norm yet.

This will eventually calm down and that's completely normal, it doesn't mean you need to rush to up your dose or switch meds (I'm not saying don't do these things as recommended by your doc).

Make the most out of this time but don't kick yourself if you're not as productive a month from now when the high is gone and your energy levels get closer to normal.

The more profound effect of the meds will still be there to help you focus and function but feeling the pill kick in like a rocket up your arse won't. The crazy unending motivation to be productive won't either and that's on you to keep up when the high dies down. Use this time to change some of your habits and build a routine that will last.

Another thing to remember as this all normalises in your brain is that you will feel more ADHD than you ever have when you don't take your meds. When you find yourself having forgotten to take your pill or taking a break from it, that isn't how you were before you started your meds, it's all super exaggerated. Brain fog will be 110% cumulonimbus, you'll likely not have the focus to pay attention to a 10 minute youtube video and you may want to eat a planet. Don't start thinking this was how you were before meds and treat the meds like a crutch because that's not what they're there for.

They help with focus and that's all they should do.

If you catch yourself wanting to take more than you should to get that high back then stop and have a long hard think about it before you do because that's a slippery slope to substance abuse.

ADHD,"So I'm sure alot of you can relate to how hard it is to take the first steps in getting better. I've put off getting help for years constantly thinking my mentality is purely situational and that hard work will change it. It never has, I've spent the last few months trying to learn to code Python and it's felt like I've spent the whole time hitting my head off a brick wall. I can't find the motivation to study, to stay engaged and to break down concepts that I struggle to understand. The course I enrolled in moved too fast and my introverted mentality meant that when I struggled I stayed quiet and acted like everything was fine despite me feeling like I was living in a burning house.

Depression and anxiety leave me feeling like I'm in constant ""wait mode"" and the only thing that really drives me is making music. I think it's the ability to constantly alter what you hear and create that keeps me engaged with it. I could literally spend days on end recording and not doing anything else.

All these feelings made me reflect on earlier instances where I've struggled with education and there was a pattern that was pretty clear to me.

i thought it will feel like im on something, it didnt feel stimulating to me, i felt 0 energy or euphoria that people describe, i get more of that from caffeine. how i feel is  i only feel calm and IN CONTROL.

I'm waiting to start meds and I can't seem to think about anything else - it needs to hurry up already

I literally have seen my friends start in the same job as me and progress onto great careers, whilst I've dropped out from being unable to cope with a busy office environment and never made it back to the starting line.

I dropped out of uni. I had to retake courses many times, I've qualified in actual careers and yet i'm not doing any of those things... 

The things I have achieved is due to my long term partner who I now realise picks up most of the slack and I know if I was solo again, I would lose it all in an instant as everything would just crumble around me.

Please tell me meds will make my brain clear, quiet, able to store and recall important data,and prioritise simple tasks!

Did anyone else experience a sense of grief over lost potential, accepting that I cannot do better without meds... and frustration that if only someone had said something earlier I wouldn't have had to suffer and struggle for nearly 40 years, and a sense of loss of identity?

ADHD,"I've been on stimulants for over 20 years, although changed to the XR form (adderall) only in the last year. 

Over the past 10 years or so I've been struggling a lot with exhaustion. It's not constant, although I'm rarely high energy per se, but I'll have weeks or months where I struggle with it a lot. 

I'm trying to figure out whether the exhaustion could be \*caused\* by either the stimulant medication or by caffeine. My doses are pretty moderate in both cases--I'm on 5 mg of the adderall XR, and I usually just have 1 cup of coffee in the morning, sometimes green tea in the afternoon.

We discussed the insomnia that  adderall causes for me and she said we were going to try concerta and do more ADHD evaluations but so far neither of those things have happened. I'm thinking it's time to find a new psychiatrist but I know finding the right meds takes a long time so I can't tell if this psychiatrist is good or not.

 I do know that we have only spoke about medication and not coping skills so I'll probably  find a new one anyway but I guess I've just been hoping because she seemed to talk about ADHD in a more informed way than others. Maybe just not informed enough because one thing she said which I didn't like was she thought my ADHD was not so bad.

ADHD,"Hey there so I was diagnosed with Inattentive ADHD and Generalized Anxiety Disorder this past November. I’m currently taking a generic Adderall XR (25mg once a day) and it’s been a few weeks now. Before this, I was taking a generic Adderall (10mg twice a day) for nearly a month and before that, I was taking Buproprion (various doses) for several months.

Buproprion definitely helped with GAD but not really for ADHD. I felt a lot more calm but still struggled with motivation and getting things done, among other things. Once I switched to Adderall, nothing seemed to change except for a slight increase in motivation. Now that I’m on XR, I definitely have the energy and excitement to do things — and to actually make them happen. I study/work in the creative industry so it feels good to be on an upward track because my projects used to be super hit or miss. I would come up with these big ideas but my performance couldn’t always deliver on it. Now I feel like I can.

However, I’ve had a lot of crying spells since taking XR (about two weeks ago). They happen almost everyday and seem to be triggered by a negative thought/reflection floating in my head or after acting on a random moment of anger/frustration. I just get super into my head, feel horrible for being this way, and then spiral into some really intense crying. Like I’ve only ever cried this hard after a bad argument or when a loved one passed away. It also feels physically crazy/manic in my head and makes me have suicidal thoughts. I’ve always struggled with this kind of emotional dysregulation but I think XR is making it more frequent and quite strong for how short a crying spell is (1–2 hours), especially triggered over something as little as a thought. I completely go back to normal when I get myself to stop crying but the suicidal thoughts have kinda stayed on my mind. Not that I’m going to act on them anytime soon. It just feels “revealed” to me now that it might be a possible outcome for me in the future, as dark as that sounds, sorry.

I wonder if any of you had similar experiences with Adderall XR? It probably doesn’t help that I’m a big coffee drinker and have had terrible sleeping habits since childhood.

Also, considering my mixed reactions to XR, it makes me wonder if I have bipolar disorder. I can write paragraphs on this and I’ll obviously just need to speak with my psychiatrist but I was wondering if any of you with bipolar disorder realized it after taking stimulants?

ADHD,"I've been struggling with this question but finally got around to posting this because I'm due for a med review in two weeks and I feel like I'm at an impasse.

I apologize for the length of this.

Brief history on my medication.  I have a history of IV drug use and am on methadone maintenance.  I got clean almost 5 years ago and started the process of coming off of it last year.  It's a very long process but I'm halfway there.  I've always struggled with adhd and was on medication for it in high school (ritalin) but that was before my addiction.  It has been pretty difficult to manage with it unmedicated and last year I sought mental health treatment.  I was prescribed vyvanse and am on 30mgs twice a day.  It was affecting my family and I couldn't pay our bills (even though the money was there) because focusing on even logging in was painful.

Present day: I am noticing that even though I'm on this medication, I revert back to my pre medicated behavior in the afternoons.  I am really forgetful and have trouble staying still long enough to finish a task.  It's almost as though the methadone that I take cancels out the positive behaviors that I have in the morning.  

I know that my psychiatrist would ask me what I would like to do and has mentioned adding an extra medication in the afternoon if i feel that i need it but I'm hoping to not have to flood myself with stimulants to combat the sedating effect of the methadone.  Is there anyone that might have any insight on this or a personal experience?

I also need to add that I'm not a relapse risk and I've been in recovery for years.  The circumstances of my life have changed so drastically that illicit drug use just isn't an option anymore.

i started concerta last month at the lowest dose. it mostly just made me really sleepy for the first couple of weeks, and after that, it didn’t do much. now i’m taking 38mg, and i feel.. great, actually! i feel a lot sharper than i’ve felt in a long time; my thoughts aren’t constantly racing, and i can actually hold long, meaningful conversations with people. starting new meds has allowed me to get closer with some of my friends because i’m much more present and grounded in the moment, and i’m so, so fucking grateful. i’m still having trouble getting myself to focus on the Right things, and getting past the mental block of Doing Things, but i’m taking it one step at a time, and feeling so much better.

ADHD,"I take 10mg Adderall. Through process of elimination I went from taking it 2x 4 hours apart to finding that I have to take it 3x 2.5 hours apart to not dip during the day. The 25 minutes it takes to kick in brings it out to about 3 hours of duration before things start heading south again, so this schedule seems to be catching it right on time. Dr agreed I may be metabolizing it quickly. Gave Vyvanse a shot and I didn't notice any change, if anything it triggered a wave of depression. Very doomy feeling. This was how we landed back at Adderall 3x.

Everything I've read states larger doses only hit harder/produce more side effects but will still be metabolized in the same amount of time. This makes sense, but what if you are taking too little?

I have not been diagnosed professionally but from what I have talked about with friends who do have adhd they all agree that I do have it. I’m really just self conscious about talking to my parents about having it. I have taken adderall three times now and I 100% feel more focused and never zone out in class my days have always been better while on it. I get done about three times more work when I have been on it. When I’m not on it Before I ever tried it or knew what it was I have had problems spacing out in class without trying to zone out if that makes sense you know I wasn’t actively thinking screw this class I don’t care  I just zone out without control of it and then when I come back I have no clue what we where talking about and it’s always extremely frustrating it’s been happening since probably first grade is as far back as I can remember. I also zone out during conversations again not on purpose it just happens and people tend to get upset of course as you can imagine.

ADHD,"I've googled and a lot of websites suggest a lot of the same, I'm gonna assume I'm not the only one that has issues with those general suggestions. So what have you found that works? Have you always done it like that? How have you adjusted your method over time?

In the military I was always told to carry a small notebook for notes and I got used to it. So for school I was always carrying a journal all the time,  so once a week I'd make one page specifically separated in sections by class and in a different color(blue) I'd write down the assignments due in a week and a half and add the due date in red. This has worked for me tough,  I did frequently run into this issue of always forgetting to go back into my journal to see things I needed to do and also this only has worked for school. It's not exactly worked for me for work or for my personal life. 

I think this is because with university you're always constantly doing something so it probably joist never leaves my mind to check it, where as with my personal life it's like I write it down and then like a week or 2 later I'm like oh yes didn't I have to 'the thing' then I re-add it to a new list in my journal and it doesn't happen. With work I find that the hard part is finding some structure. Like in a school you have 4-6 classes each with their often assignments that are constantly happening at the same time and each class almost expects you to put in the same energy into all classes at the same time(at least that's the way it feels to me), but with work itself like you 3 projects but you may have forgotten about one because it wasn't a job that required a lot of time or there wasn't any rush etc. 

How would you guys suggest I edit my time management style to adjust to these things?

I am currently struggling even with university this last semester because I keep forgetting things I need to do. Or I overly focus on one class and forget about the other 4.

But this is becoming tedious and I'm forgetting to do it. I'm starting to notice 3 out of my 4 teams this semester may think I don't care. But I do, and I'm frustrated. 

 I was considering doing a mix of my journal and my calendar, but again -&gt; tedious. I tried this one website called Zapier (or something like that) so that I could add each assignment to a google sheets and it automatically adds them to my Google calendar, but I don't know if it may be that I don't understand how to set everything up or that it may not be a refined platform yet, but it's not exactly working for me very well. I also did a new google sheet, and pinned it to my chrome, I treated each thing in my life as an action item and when I complete it goes green and is hidden, also has a countdown for each assignment, but again... I keep forgetting to check this and update. 

I learn the platform a bit better, but I don't want to spend a whole day or 2 figuring it out right now. Maybe in the future. But right now every day is too busy to dedicate to learning this.

ADHD,"Just wondering what others' experiences of this are (and hoping someone has a nice explanation of it, that will add to my growing understanding of this Thing that constantly affects my life).

I had an intense couple of days at work (Occupational Therapy). It's always busy but the particular combination of working with patients and other staff, getting excited about patients' progress, and coming up with ideas and solutions - has been really intense and varied. 

I do this thing sometimes where I just need to sit or lie down and stare at something for a while. Often it's a reflective surface or source of light. A bath with bubbles is amazing for this process. Last night it was a different sensory thing - wriggling my feet in slippers with a soft lining. 

I do this kind of thing when I'm emotionally overwhelmed, but I've started to recognise the need to do it at other times - when I've been busy and 'switched on' in an enjoyable, productive way, for an extended period, for example.

My partner was a bit concerned as I usually do this stuff alone but last night I was so tired I didn't seem to have the choice to move and just sat there being a weirdo for a while. It can last ten minutes to half an hour, I don't really think about anything when I'm doing it - just random thoughts that pass through my head but don't affect me.

The milder version of this is doing something mindless on my phone - sometimes after my regular 4 hour drive, I stay in the car doing this before I feel ready to go in the house and interact with my partner. 

It's not something that bothers me, as I am usually able to go somewhere alone to do some version of this when I need to. Just curious about other peoples' experiences!",My brain completely switching off after an extended period of hard work
ADHD,"I’m currently in the middle of studying in a week that I still have 4 exams and and a project that will end up being around 10-15 pages and I haven’t started yet.

But here I am getting distracted by my own curios mind. How many people whenever they question something need to search for it right away? This is probably even is common for neurotypical people, but at the rate in which thoughts enter my head this can be really bad for people like us.

While looking stuff up I just started thinking “what am I doing? There is no reason for me to be doing this right now”. Within the last hour I watched 5 stretching YT vids( i have a pec injury), google searched - how to measure shoe width, how can you display safari bookmark icons, right temperature for cold showers, and much more.

My issue is that it’s usually a deep dive into whatever I’m searching(and also a lot of mini searches), this can be so time consuming and exhausting. I would say this adds to a wealth of knowledge, but in reality I’ll forget half of the stuff anyway. 

Honestly, I’m just venting and using this as another way to be distracted","How bad does your frantic, random internet searching get?"

My D&amp;D campaign that I've been putting off for years has had more progress put in to it in four days than in four years.

I wish I knew earlier. I'm sure 28 isn't that old in the grand scheme of things but it still hurts to think of what I could have done at school instead of failing out of university.

Hi all!

I have an appointment at a psych for medication management with a psych on April 1st so that I can get back on ADHD medication (I was diagnosed as a child) 

As a child, hyperactivity was the big challenge for me. I couldn’t sit still. I was constantly falling out of my seat at school. I couldn’t focus. My thoughts we’re all over the place. My mom told me my medication made a night and day difference—you could see it in my eyes lol

Now, the big challenge is finding the energy to do stuff and emotional regulation. My emotional regulation has been shit since high school. It’s gotten a little better, but it’s still bad. I hyperfocus on relationships with a single person and then almost cast them aside when someone better in my eyes comes along.

I...

- obsess over them texting me and me replying to them. Seriously. I would miss out on activities and going places because I was so afraid to miss replying to them.

- fear bringing up any sort of boundary or starting any fights in fear that they’ll leave me.

- take every single little change as an indicator they’re over me or lost interest. Ex. My boyfriend not FaceTiming me one night means he’ll never FaceTime me again and he’s lost all interest in me despite texting me all day.

- get jealous if they mentioned anyone other than me. If my friend mentioned another friend, or if they called someone else their best friend it’s the end of the world for me. Same with my boyfriend commenting on other people’s appearance.

- would use my anxiety as a crutch in order to draw attention to me when I felt something was wrong. If I didn’t get the reaction I wanted, it would make it 10 times worse. Sometimes I even want to die when I don’t get the response I want. I used to even tell my friends that, which was SO toxic in retrospect, and I no longer do that even though I feel it deeply.

- get offended when it seems someone isn’t responding the way I want them too. I compare the beginning of relationships to the comfortable now and crave the passion and the overtrying—it makes me want to jump in and repeat the cycle even though I’m happy where I’m at.

- stop caring for these people I obsess over after a new person moves in.

I’m worried I might actually have borderline personality disorder. I actually took several online tests to indicate and compared to my neuro typical friend—she was mild indicator and I was severe. However, I know a lot of symptoms of bpd and ADHD overlap.

ADHD,"Hey y'all,

I've been prescribed Vyvanse (30mg) a couple days ago and yesterday started taking it for the first time. I have previous experience with Ritalin and Strattera and so far, Vyvanse seems like the best option (ofc I can't *really* tell yet, it's only been 2 days bla bla yada yada). 

I was kind of afraid of starting to take it because I feared my appetite would be gone entirely (and this is my 1st experience ever with a stimulant) like the Strattera did (eating on Strattera was insanely hard for me which was a shame bc I love food and I'm a foodie), but to my surprise it... Actually seems to increase my appetite? I ate regular meals today, like I usually do, and despite that I was still hungry afterwards (even with snacks in between!). Is this a side effect? Will this subside eventually?

Further, I have nausea from time to time despite eating regularly and drinking a fuck ton of water (i have no issue with the latter, I normally drink 3-4l a day). I wonder whether this will subside as well?

Advice would be appreciated. I would really like to continue with this med as I, so far, have the most pleasant experiences with it (and don't feel totally ""drugged up"" or ""spaced out"" like on Ritalin/Strattera, but actually I feel like myself, just with a bit of improved focus).",Vyvanse makes me.. hungry?

I had to switch over from an ADHD clinic to Remedy Psychiatry because of affordability. The ADHD clinic prescribed me a non-stimulant because of my ADHD combined with depression and anxiety. Then, Remedy Psych prescribed me Zoloft to help with PMDD. Both are helping me a lot in terms of the depression and anxiety. In fact I feel good about life HOWEVER I don’t feel any more motivated to do basic things. My ADHD symptoms are a lot more pronounced. It’s kind of a combination of the SSRI making me feel good and not guilty and I feel so good on the couch cuddled up why bother getting up to make dinner. I expressed my concern to my psych and he said we will keep increasing the Zoloft and see if that helps with my motivation. He says that his goal is that we don’t have to prescribe me a cocktail of medications and see if just one med could solve all my issues. I don’t know if he’s saying this because he’s hesitant about stimulants. I feel like I really need a stimulant at this point. I’ve washed my bed sheets three weeks ago for the first time in four months, but haven’t bothered to put them on my bed so I’ve been sleeping on the couch this whole time.

ADHD,"So I was tested for ADHD in middle school and was told that I just had severe anxiety that caused ADHD symptoms. I always thought this wasn't quite right and researched basically every disorder in the DSM trying to figure out what was wrong with me. Funnily enough, I never looked at ADHD because I was told I didn't have it. I finally started consistently taking anxiety medication a little over a year ago, and it helps big time to calm my anxiety, but it does nothing for those ADHD symptoms. I finally started to realize that the psychiatrist might've actually been wrong. The thing that really pushed me to get tested again was the fact that my younger sister, who's turning 20 in about a week, got diagnosed in February. I know that ADHD has a relatively large genetic component so I did a lot of research and literally my entire life made sense. Why I couldn't remember simple tasks, how I would always cut people off and finish their sentences (literally can't get through a 2 minute conversation without interjecting), how it's nearly impossible for me to read a textbook, how my ex would constantly tell me that I was terrible at listening and how my mind would go absolutely blank every time she would get mad at me, how I did well in school up until college and all of a sudden I'm quite literally failing out because I finally hit my wall (also a reason I never pursued a diagnosis because I wrongly assumed that I couldn't possibly have ADHD and do well in school), and how I would have some incredibly terrible angry outbursts at my exes that still haunt me to this day.

It's just so frustrating that I could've found this out as a child and been able to manage it and understand myself. Instead I wasted 22 years going on a wild goose chase when the answer was right in front of me the whole time. Looking back, it's almost ridiculous to think that this went under the radar for so long. 

Long story short (TL;DR), I'm new to this and could really use some help. I know the basics, but I know there is so much more to ADHD that meets the eye. If anyone has any helpful information, advice or literally anything that you've found helpful, I could really use it right now. I feel like a new born baby just now figuring out the world.

ADHD,"My psychiatrist said she feels out of her league regarding my care and is pushing me toward doing a partial hospitalization, despite my repeated insistence that I would be uncomfortable doing that. I’m a year into a new job and still trying to learn the ropes, and more than that, her reasoning is that I would be seen by a variety of mental health professionals who could monitor me in person to treat me. The issue is that I perform well under pressure - historically I have always passed as high functioning because I get things done last minute out of anxiety, and in that kind of setting, I would be stressed out of my mind because of being observed by strangers, so I would end up following a strict routine.

This is hardly reflective of what it is like daily for me, where I suffer from severe depression and extreme executive dysfunction that feels like it’s ruining my life.  I can only get things done under pressure, so work is constantly a nightmare because I’m stressed till the last minute, where the anxiety finally builds up enough that I can focus. None of the meds my psychiatrist has prescribed so far work (as in, they literally have no effect), and she seems reluctant to remove me from the Zoloft I have been taking at max dose for months despite me wanting to try something else when it’s clearly not working. I am also concerned because she said we could try increasing the dose, but my understanding that my current dose of Zoloft (200 mg) is the max dose. She added a stimulant recently that has had zero effect and now wants to try another medication but wants to work toward getting me into the partial program.

I disagree with this treatment plan and don’t feel like it will do anything except keep me on meds that aren’t working and force me into a high stress situation. But I’m not sure if I’m wrong and wanted to get a second opinion. Is it okay for me to want to see a different psychiatrist? Possibly one that specializes in ADHD? While I have been diagnosed with OCD and severe depression and anxiety thus far, I have not been formally diagnosed with ADHD. But I do have many strong ADHD symptoms though and they are the most debilitating part of my mental health issues, so I thought a specialist might at least be able to determine what could be going on there.

ADHD,"This post is mostly just a result of modafinil induced pondering while I was performing a tedious task.

Today has been a truly adhd day so far. I woke up 3 hours earlier to attend an appointment only to realise my dumb ass can't read time and accidentally put the alarm for 7 instead of 6 (yeah, all 4 of them). I was blissfully eating when I realised that 7.50 is actually 7.50, not 6.50. And my appt across town at 8 am will not be happening. I have no idea what kind of a glitch was that.

So then I figured OK I got this extra time before work, and I could just start earlier since I work from home, or I could go on a mad cleaning spree. I did the latter.

She just wants the good parts of a person without any of their shit iykwim. She says having unwanted things in her mind is bad for her.

Plus we have always been an on again off again type.

We had a bit of an argument again. She was having doubts about us and she wanted some time apart.

I'd be fine but it is the 5th time this happened in the span of 2 months...

She has depression and I've tried to be understanding but today was... bad

She tries to hurt me to push me away. It is very odd?

And I snapped. 

I told her if she wants this then she should commit, not bs about labels but to me to us.

If she cannot she should stop texting me and move on.

It's not completely bad. It's just inconsistent.

The highs are phenomenal but the lows are miserable.

I'm here for advice.

How do I not go back to her if she comes back? Gods help I still love her but I got my own crap to deal with.

And she is a very caring person just commitment afraid. She helps me a lot with organisation and discipline and so much more

I wish she was a bit more ready for commitment.

ADHD,"Since Adderall isn't available in most countries, I would like to know some of you Americans opinions who have tried both medications. How did they compare to each other? Which one was better? I know Ritalin only inhibits dopamine reuptake but does not increase the amount of dopamine like adderall does. A lot of people on podcasts say Adderall is the best for people who have the worst cases of ADHD since their proprietary blend of dextroamphetamines and amphetamine salts maximize your attention and motivation to get the things done you need to get done, while also minimizing noradrenaline reuptake and secretion.

ADHD,"TL;DR at the bottom

I just started Vyvanse three days ago. I am being started on 30mg, however my psychiatrist predicted before starting that I will probably need 50mg, but we're just starting me on 30mg to test the waters since I suffer a lot from anxiety.

So basically when the vyvanse kicks in I feel great. A little bit of a headache but it goes away after some gatorade. My body becomes very relaxed and I don't feel like fidgeting that much anymore. It also helps to ease my anxiety and intrusive thoughts TREMENDOUSLY as my emotions are more stabilized and I feel like I got much more control over my thoughts. I do become less creative and less funny lol, but it's worth it. I become more hyped to do average shit and I also get more excited to talk to other people lol. I don't procrastinate when I am going to do something, I can do stuff without getting side tracked and it is much easier for me to finish what I started. 
However, I still fidget. Not as much, but I still do it. I also honestly don't feel a lot of improvement with my focus. I'm more able to do stuff without getting side tracked, but I still skimread etc and struggle to do written tasks (my reading/writing skills are good but I just still struggle to focus) this is the main thing that makes me want to up my dosage.

This lasts for about two/three hours until I start to feel tired and sluggish, and more restless/fidhety again. If I don't eat or drink enough I can feel extremely ill, like as if I have the flu, and feel extremely sleepy even if I got enough sleep the other night. I also feel numb and a bit sad/irritated and things doesn't excite me. I then feel like a zombie for the rest of the day.

Should I up my dosage? Has anyone else experience this?

TL;DR: I started Vyvanse 30mg three days ago, it hasn't improved my focus too much but my executive functioning has improved and my anxiety has gone down a lot. However I start feeling restless and sluggish again after 2/3 hours and I feel like a zombie for the rest of the day. Should I up my dosage?",I think I need to up my dosage of Vyvanse
ADHD,"For my fellow medicated ADHD buddies, please don't let your meds substitute rest. 

I've been working really hard (just tryna finish my master's thesis... on year 3 and feeling so low) lately and that's resulted in me forgetting to take care of myself. A week ago I pulled an all-nighter as a 25 year old for the first time since high school. I had a deadline and my perfectionist tendencies won. Last night, I was up until 3am. After getting up at 6am, driving 2 hours to main campus for some help/to pick up some things (including my adderal Rx; I just moved home for my mental health and finances). Drove an extra 1m5 hours to drop something off to a friend, then drove 2.5 hours back home. I got home at 8pm. I drank a black coffee, a sugary Starbucks coffee, and a bag of Starbucks chips between 7am-8pm. I was nauseous. Hangry. Mentally exhausted. Emotional. Snappy with my partner. When filling up on gas before the final stretch of the drive, the gas station attendant had to remind me to TURN MY ENGINE OFF. It was 530pm. I was in a daze. 

I forget that my meds are not a substitute for nutrition, hydration, or energy. Im a bright gal but I push myself too hard and don't realize it until I am risking an explosion at a gas station. 

So, take your meds if they help you. Mine help me so much. But don't forget to sleep. And eat. And drink. And take a minute to relax. You'll do better in the long run even though your brain is telling you ""GOTTA GO NOW GOTTA GO BEFORE YOU BECOME DISTRACTED AND UNMOTIVATED""

ADHD,"I'll try to keep it short. This is probably the only sub where that's a good thing lmao.  


I was diagnosed with ADHD roughly 4 months ago, and have since been taking 20mg Adderall daily. One thing I thought would get better was my ability to study and retain information a little better. The company I work for wants me to get a networking certification, which takes roughly 4-8 months for the average person. I'm fairly consistent with my study schedule, but still feel like I retain nothing after taking online courses, reading textbooks, and exploring study topics at work. The Adderall has been nothing but beneficial otherwise, and I don't plan on asking for my dosage to be upped any time soon.  Do you guys have any tips on improving my ability to retain information?

ADHD,"I was feeling like shit about dropping one of my university courses this semester, which may extend my graduation date since it isn't the first time. I just bit off more than I could chew and was having massive breakdowns trying to handle a full courseload. I'll be honest, during the breakdown that caused me to realize I needed to drop the course I had some thoughts of self harm. I'd never act on them, but it wasn't a good time.

And yet, somehow, at the same time, I was in the process of interviewing for a pretty fucking prestigious and well-paying internship. One that will carry a LOT of weight toward me getting a lucrative job after I graduate. And guess what, today I both dropped the class and found out I got the job.

Don't let the things you can't handle convince you not to try your best to achieve your goals. You can't do some things. You'll take longer, you'll get more distracted, you'll be more stressed and you'll struggle more to handle that. And that's okay. It's okay to accept that and go at the pace you can.

Never let those things stop you from going out on a limb and applying for an internship you don't think you'll get at 2AM while procrastinating working on an assignment that's already two days late. You send that fucking application. You aren't a failure. Don't let all the things that don't work for you get in the way of trying things that might.

ADHD,"I’ve had symptoms of ADHD since I was a kid but wasn’t diagnosed until just recently, but I always knew I had it. I haven’t gone on medication yet but I have my medical MMJ card for my ADHD, which has profoundly helped me. 

Anyways, a symptom of my adult ADHD is really irrational anger outbursts. I work at an extremely high paced, stressful and intense job (It’s a very very busy coffee shop, yay) and while sometimes my ADHD feels like an advantage (better at multitasking and high pace environments) I really struggle with getting overstimulated and then consequently having a meltdown. It’s something that one of my managers has noticed and has had a pretty awful reaction to, which I partly understand. This manager tends to pick apart every little thing I do (critique everything, for example the way I make drinks) literally everything he can criticize he does, which has been triggering some seriously intense ADHD in me. And I’m not sure what to do, especially since I got recently diagnosed this is all pretty new to me. Does anyone have advice for me?

ADHD,"I started this new job at the beginning of Feb, and I basically haven't gone at all or done anything. Like literally, I just haven't been going in. And I haven't been working when I'm at home. But a lot of people are wfh because COVID so they haven't noticed much yet.

My first big presentation is Mar 24, so I have about 2 weeks to do 2 months worth of work. And I still can't seem to motivate myself to go in, I haven't done anything since last Thursday. People think I'm joking when I say stuff like that, I trust this community will understand that I literally haven't done *anything*.

I feel like I used to have a slightly better handle about at least doing enough to keep my head above water before COVID, but the last year I've literally done almost no work whatsoever at my last position or at this one. And somehow I got away with it because of the craziness of the year, but this new position I won't be able to do that.

I don't know what to do. I'm on Vyvanse and I have been off and on for over a decade. I'm afraid to talk to a doctor because if I admit that I'm struggling I feel like he will want to change things up, and I'm scared of it getting even worse than it is now. I'm 32 years old and I've basically managed to just get by my entire life because people cut me breaks all the time thinking I have potential, and I'm afraid that my ADHD has become more severe and I've reached the point in life where that no longer will work.

ADHD,"Hey everyone,  I was recently diagnosed with for the second time in a long time and prescribed Adderall XR. Today is my first day on it and any sort of medication in general, and I feel... weird. I am definitely seeing some improvements, I can pick up whole conversations and not have to piece together the rest, I can focus on stuff that doesn't interest me necessarily. I can pick up on a lecture I had today and I have a better track of when I've done stuff and how long ago I've done it. I don't have the urge to overeat. Most importantly I feel like I can finish something without the immense amount of pressure that I needed to feel before.

But with that being said, I also feel weird. My brain feels odd, and lightheaded. The feeling comes and goes. Is this normal for my first time? My doctor says I would maybe feel stimulated and it would cause insomnia if I took it too late but I'm honestly feeling just, normal. I was never hyperactive but I feel more in control of my bodily movements now. Sorry for the jumble of thoughts but the whole situation is kind of odd to me.

ADHD,"I heard this story all the time, but I never thought it would happen to me. A year ago, just at the start of the pandemic, I got kicked off of my ADHD meds because of my high blood pressure. I was obviously super nervous because I had routinely been taking meds since the third grade, and I could really tell when I was on or off of my meds. And it was obviously super hard at first, I was missing deadlines like crazy, generally being disorganized, having lots of trouble concentrating, the basic adhd experience. But I didn’t really have any other choice than to keep working at it, and that’s what I did.
Well, a year later, I’m so happy with how it’s turned out! I’ve learned so much about living with unmedicated ADHD, and hey, I’m still in college, still cruising, and my grades have actually been alright!
I don’t mean to brag at all, it’s just that this subreddit can be really pessimistic sometimes so I figured I’d share my success just to let people know that ADHD is far from a death sentence. I know it can be so so hard to learn to live with it and work with it, especially for people diagnosed with ADHD later on in life, but I promise that better days are ahead. It’s a process that takes a long time, and it certainly isn’t easy and requires a lot of trial and error, but  it works out in the end.

ADHD,"[TL;DR: I've been very open with my coworkers and supervisors about my adhd, but I have issues so inconsistently that people have begun suspecting that I'm faking problems to get out of things I don't want to do. I've talked to management about it and thought we'd reached an understanding, but things are getting tense again. I wonder if my recent improvement in handling my issues might be working against me.]

I'm 37, diagnosed at 30.  I take Adderall daily. After I lost my office job two years ago, I started working in fast food (well, beverages, really.)

I've been learning a lot about adhd since my diagnosis, and sensory overload didn't even enter the conversation with a therapist until about a year before I lost my job.

When I started the fast food job, I knew there was going to be an adjustment period for me to get used to working in a fast-paced, noisy environment with frequent demands to multi-task.  I also knew that I would be in very close proximity to other people and that physical contact would be unavoidable. (We bump into each other a lot!)

I've been very open with my issues, and everyone was generally very supportive, at least at first.

It's taken me a long time to get to the point where I can function more or less normally, but I still have major issues with being told to ""speed up"" (Which leads to me panicking and making mistakes), and with completely shutting down when I get overwhelmed. I also had an anger outburst last year that was completely out of character for me and led to my getting a write-up.

So here's the problem:

Some days, I'm completely fine.  I've gone full months without any problems.  And then out of nowhere, suddenly I'm having meltdowns or multiple days where I'm having major problems at work.  It's extremely inconsistent, and some of my coworkers commented to supervisors that it looked like I was just ""having issues"" to get out of things I didn't want to do.

That led to complaints from coworkers to management that it was unfair that I could just start stuttering or acting anxious, and then get to go sit in the back or wash dishes.

I was only made aware of this when a supervisor made an offhand comment about how I'm ""being babied"" and how I needed to knock it off.

There were conversations between me and management and I thought we'd reached an understanding, but things are starting to get tense again.

I recognize this is definitely the wrong environment for me, but I do get decent benefits from my job and I'm still hoping that I'll eventually be able to go back to school to get the certifications I need to pursue what I'm passionate about.

Management at my store recognizes that I do good work, but when I've directly asked if they think I'm faking my ADHD (during conversations regarding the above problems), they don't outright say yes, but they do give me that ""knowing look"".

I've been steadily improving with coping and taking measures to prevent shutdowns and meltdowns, but I think that might be working against me?  Like ""oh, you can do it NOW, so I guess you just needed to try hard and work at it"" or something like that?

It's gotten to the point where I'm even questioning whether I've actually got adhd or if I've just convinced myself that I do.

ADHD,"I recently got medicated for my ADHD and I thought it’ll be helpful for me to tell the differences I have noticed this past month.

If I have said something I shouldn’t have please let me know. I have done research but If I have mentioned something that has nothing to do with ADHD, tell me and I will 100% edit/delete/add anything that’s needed.

Off:
Before I knew anything about what ADHD truly was I stopped taking my medicine (this was at 8 so I didn’t know any-better) and disposed of it. My mom found out and she ended up letting me stop taking it, she noticed I didn’t change personality wise so she thought I was fine, which is true I acted the same as I always had. That’s not the problem though I didn’t notice it until recently but I would blame myself A lot more when I was off. It felt like every little thing that I did wrong was a big deal and it felt like everyone hated me. Eventually middle school came and i thought people were ignoring me and thought I was annoying but they were just not talking to me. What made it even worse I still thought ADHD just made me more hyper so I thought I was crazy or something and I knew it didn’t matter but I KEPT WORRYING ABOUT NOTHING.

On: Then I got exposed to the media, other people with ADHD we’re saying similar things to what I’ve been dealing with, that caused me to do some more research and that’s when I decided I should try the medicine again. (At this time my mom tried to get me back on about a week ago but I refused saying I was fine) So I went up to my mom and agreed to try it for a day or two. Next day I got up, took it pill, and waited, waited for a screwup. That day it was a snow day (I live in Texas, this was this year) I went outside, made a lousy snowman, went back in side, and noticed I tracked dog shit in the house ... but, it wasn’t my fault. SUCCESS, it FINALLY wasn’t my fault. Then I went back to school, the normal things that bugged be weren’t there, I didn’t care as much about what other people thought.

After events of the last year I'm going back to school as it's one of the opportunities to present itself. This has been kind of a terrifying prospect considering all the troubles I've had with schooling in the past. But I thought, I was in high school in the 90's. Surely I'll have things under better control now. Well I started at a school in the summer and failed every class. I did get in contact with their student mental health department though and started doing something about ADHD for the first time in my life (growing up my parents didn't really believe in it or my teachers who suggested I get checked, I just needed more discipline).

We've been trying a few things, hampered by the fact my current bare bones insurance will not pay for any kind of testing and so getting an official diagnosis is financially out of the question. We started with Wellbutrin. Currently I'm taking 300mg a day. That actually seemed to have its biggest impact when I first started taking it. Then as I got used to it the effect lessened. It still helps, but not nearly enough. We've added Strattera to that now too. That's also having a small positive impact. But I'm still barely squeeking by accomplishing things at school and uncertain if I'll be able to finish my program. I don't really know what more I can do, if there is anything more I can do.

ADHD,"This is a little heavy in context but I really want to get input on shame and embarrassment and ADHD. Super minor TW for sexual assault. 

I know that ADHD is linked heavily with feelings of shame but the articles I’ve found really only mention shame from perceived failures due to ADHD symptoms. I definitely struggle with that some but I’m fortunate enough to be surrounded by people who work really hard to understand. However, I’m 22 but I’ve had some very stressful things happen including sexual assault, abusive relationship at 16 with an older man, etc. things I know are not my fault and would kill another woman for feeling shame over. Yet I feel so much shame over those events that I cannot for the life of me speak about them with anyone. I’ve only spoken about them to a therapist once and only because I dissociated severely and daily and told her while dissociated and barely knew what was going on. But since those episodes stopped, I feel a debilitating embarrassment at the thought of anyone finding out or trying to speak with me about them. 

I’m usually a super happy person (the H ADHD is strong haha) but since I’ve never properly processed, I do get flashbacks, occasionally dissociation and cannot be in the presence of a man more than once without some serious Xanax. I know that processing through will help SO MUCH but i literally physically cannot because of embarrassment. 

This is not a pity party at all or a convo about assault or trauma, I just do not know why I’m incapable of letting those feelings of shame go, even with a therapist and because of the link of shame and ADHD, I was wondering if anyone has any similar experiences/tips/links?

anyways im just sleep deprived &amp; tired of my brain not agreeing with me. i made a pact with myself to do my slides as soon as i get home &amp; then go to bed at like 10pm like a normal person, but we’ll see how well that goes",so close yet so far

You don’t need to reorganize that drawer when you put something away into it.

You don’t need to reorganize your closet when you put away laundry.

You don’t need to rearrange your books and shelf knick knacks when you’re dusting.

It’s ok to just put things away even if the storage you’re putting them away into doesn’t look like it was organized by a professional.

Cleaning is not supposed to take a very long time and be something that you feel you’re constantly doing and somehow nothing is ever completely clean.

Idk how other people do it because some people are gods at texting.",I cannot tell you how much I hate texting
ADHD,"Warning: This will be word vomit.

I hate my college education right now. So much. Today I couldn't even muster the energy to glance at my work and I knew I'd fail assignments for classes that I'm already shakey in. I just don't freaking care. I'm not attached to the classes or the people in the class, or anything really.

I'm a biology major and I'm usually good with science, but I can't force myself into doing it anymore. I'm not sure if it's because it's online or what, but I'm suffering. The only class I like is a gen ed, Ethics. Like I love this class, but I'm not sure I love it for on the contents or because it's just easy. I'm the kind of person that is either natural talented at something, or just plain ole shit at it (and I will never ever put in the effort to better myself in it if it doesn't come naturally). That alone might be an ADHD thing, I'm not sure. But it should be said that I hate even the classes that pertain to my major. 

I'm flirting with the idea of switching majors, but I'm hesitant. I'm a sophomore and I switched my majors last year's from veterinary science to general biology so I don't want to just keep switch shit up. I will mention I noticed this pattern that half way through a school year I will get bored of everything and the second semester I will start to suffering in grades and care. 

At the same time, I'm suffering from apathy. I want to be a english major, which is completely fucking different. I know nothing with switch over and I'm terrified I'll begin to hate english too. It's hard to convince my parents who are paying for all this too. The thing is that I love english and I'm good at it, but I'm scared it will be a ""grass is greener"" situation that I'll wind up regretting. I know any major will have it's challenges, but I actually think I might have a shot with this one. That's also what I thought when I changed my major before.

And fuck this fucking covid online thing. I'm so good at learning when it's in person and I can't fucking telling I'm struggling with the content I'm learning or the online aspect or both. I'm in like a whirlpool and possible things that could push me in either way and I can't fucking tell what's what anymore and this decision will affect my entire fucking life.

And to top it all off, I'm sitting next to a girl loudly make mouth sounds while eating and I can't leave without being rude so I'm just fuming over that and all this combined and I want to jump into a volcano.",I'm at a crossroads and I don't know if it's legit or that my ADHD is acting up
ADHD,"I have struggled with timely sleep my entire life. ""Revenge Bedtime Procrastination"" generally, but sometimes my rhythm is just off. I am middle aged now and if I miss more than two nights of timely sleep, it will literally take WEEKS to recover.

Sleep hygiene advice is good and helpful, and has worked in conjunction with this strategy I've been trying to do the past few months, and has been pretty successful at helpinge get back on track.

I have 7 blue square cards that have restickable tape (painters blue tape) on the back, and ""sleep"" written on the front. They all look the same.

I have decided, for me, that I want 7-8 hrs per night. I've learned I feel best after this amount. I need to wake up by 7:30 so I need to be in bed between 11 and 12.

Success is when I make decisions that are in support of this habit, eg.. Choosing to do my night routine at 11 or so. 
Not success is  starting another episode, or another project, or doing anything else that isn't leading towards sleeping in my bed, 

I fall asleep well enough (sometimes with sleep aids) that starting my routine is sufficient to lead to better habits; your definition of success may he different.

When I have 2 successes consecutively, I stick a blue card up on the wall byy bathroom. If I have a single not success, I do not add a card. If I have two consecutive not successes, I remove all the cards that I had accumulated.

I've found that 7 or 8 cards (the number on the boundary if the brain just shorthanding ""many"")  is sufficient for me, tho there's no reason it couldn't continue indefinitely.



Originally, I started with adding one every night and then wiping all of them, but I found that to be a bit unkind to myself, and I felt like I failed a lot more if I messed up a day. It sucks when an opportunity comes up that requires bending the rule a little and you lose all your progress, y'know?

My longest streak with this was November to mid December (2020) -- about 6 weeks. The difference in my brain function was notable. I had two days of vacation time, spaced a few days apart, around xmas, where I stayed up too late and lost ally progress. I am currently at 3 cards, going on 4 tomorrow. (It's taken me THAT LONG to correct).

Anyways, I hope maybe this helps someone. Read about sleep hygiene, too, it makes a big difference.",Building better sleep habits
ADHD,"Long story short, I realised I had less than two days worth of medication left, my mother tried to book an appt with the psychiatrist to get another script (my current one has run out of repeats), but literally the soonest available time is the 15th of may... two months away. I'm currently in my final year of highschool and I've only just started getting better at doing work/ getting better at school, but I was *barely* functioning *with* my medication, and now I'm going to have to try and somehow get by without it for a while.

I was diagnosed with adhd a long time ago and I know the effects are still there and all that sht but I haven’t taken meds ever. I started considering taking meds because maybe it will help me perform better especially with school cause even if I am fairly ok sometimes I have this one or two subjects were I get close to failing because of my ADHD but overall it’s not horrible. So, should i consider taking meds or no? Should I just find natural ways to deal with it? How was your experience the first time you tried meds out?",Question about meds
ADHD,"I don't care about the high you get and I just want to be able to focus more. Does this still persist even after taking it after a while? If not, I'm afraid that if go on meds, it will stop working and I will end up being my dumb old self. I honestly want to feel as close to normal as possible. I also want to have the motivation and focus to actually accomplish things instead of putting things off and even when I have a the short burst of energy somehow, trying to focus is incredibly hard as I can't even read a book without skimming through it or forgetting what the words say in the next paragraph. (This only doesn't happen when I happen to read a rare book that I'm incredibly into but I still tend to skim to look for key words so I don't have to read all of it). 

I know this is off topic but I'm assuming meds won't help with my fidgeting that I do with my body or the constant thoughts (especially depressing thoughts) that run in my head right?

ADHD,"Hello again! Your advice helped so much last time, it meant a lot. We got a lot of the blue tack off the walls now! My partner has a calendar they use! Yay!

There is a small thing I need advice on. It bugs the hell out of me and I can't tell if it's a me problem or something that needs worked on.

My partner always seems to remember things when I do them. Like, always. Examples: if I go to study, they remember they have to study. If I sweep the floors, they remember they wanted to sweep the bathroom floor. If I lay down because my back hurts, they need to lay down too.

It's really started to irritate me because it's made me feel like all jobs are my responsibility to notice first. Also it means they get in the way nearly every time they begin the same task I'm doing.

I will start getting dressed and then they will. If I go to the grocery store, they have to come with me, because they have a list too.  If I water the living room plants, they water the bedroom ones.

You would THINK I'd appreciate the help, and I do, but it means I also can't hyper focus on any of my chores. I have to constantly be aware of their presence, I will be halfway through a chore, say watering plants, go to the bedroom with my watering can and oh... They are doing it as I'm in the doorway. I suddenly have to switch tasks. And then when I do, they do that one too.

Is this as annoying to others as I am finding it? I understand someone with ADHD needs reminders, but I don't exist to be a living reminder either, you know? Plus sometimes I would like to focus on a task from start to finish without being abruptly interrupted.

I've tried to talk to them about this before and they said they understood why it would make me feel like the pressure on me was to start every task we do, but it never stopped because adhd and forgetting, you know? They simply do not remember they had tasks planned unless I start them.

There is a huge caveat here that I am disabled and my partner is great at daily chores, cooking, laundry, the really obvious stuff. It's the non-obvious chores like sweeping, wiping windows, counters, cleaning out the fridge, studying etc that they can't keep track of.

So do I just need to calm my farm or should I try to word this discussion a better way to my partner?

ADHD,"So I’ve posted before about how I was with a therapist for four drawn out months and finally went to see the office’s psychiatrist but left crying after one appt bc he had such an outdated view of adhd and dismissed allll of my symptoms, saying I was too smart and polite to have adhd (???), then he said I had to pay for testing but that I wouldn’t pass the test, etc. Then that therapist literally ghosted me (like bad, I reached out and was like hello? And still no response even tho we were supposed to have an appt that day)

So today I finally was able to try a new office and I saw a nurse practitioner (meaning she can prescribe)... let’s just say that after ONE appointment she set me up to get blood work (just in case my fatigue is caused by something physiological), also gave me some techniques to help my sleep, set me up with a new counselor, AND prescribed me Strattera!!!!!

I literally had a few mental breakdowns in the past month bc it felt like I would never get help, particularly medication. This time I left the appointment and went and cried HAPPY tears!!

ADHD,"My entire life I feel like people end up micromanaging and criticising everything I do. My parents, past partners, my boss... I understand why things I do may be frustrating or annoying; I’m forgetful, messy and often leave things half finished and then get distracted and forget about them. It must be irritating to find random half finished tasks everywhere. 

However it doesn’t make it any less upsetting or demoralising for me. Constant criticism over my habits or behaviours, telling me to do things in specific ways and not trusting me to do things right or properly so patronising me in order to check that I will do it right. It’s gets hard to keep hearing these things on a daily basis. 

It just puts me in a deep depression and makes me feel annoying, useless and incompetent. It leaves me feeling constantly on edge, terrified of making mistakes as I seem to constantly make them. Sometimes it feels like I can’t just be myself around people, because myself causes stress and irritation to others. I hope I’m not alone in feeling this.

ADHD,"So I'm currently in the process of getting back into learning coding after previously falling off.

About 2 years ago I was really determined to try to learn coding and become a web developer. I tried to use things like code academy, Treehouse, YouTube and Udemy to find resources to learn and while I was able to mess around and learn a little basic HTML and CSS I still felt like it wasnt sticking and the more I learned thr more lost I felt. 

So I ended up deciding to give up on it and decide it wasnt for me as it was really hard to stay focused on learning and because I was just trying to follow the training curriculum and build what they wanted i was not interested. 

Flash forward to now, after discovering I identify with ADHD and trying to change my life to accommodate. I decided to try coding again as I thought mayb did I try to start on things that are more interesting I might be able to stick with it?

I guess my question is what has helped others here with ADHD to stay motivated? Does college help very much? What about bootcamps? Maybe other online resources or community's I can look into?

I tried to learn before completely on my own but i think it was a mistake and even though I have a lot of social anxiety I know if I network I can learn so much faster. Has anyone else had to overcome this to become more successful?

ADHD,"Where I live (Italy), I can definitely say mental health is not a trivial matter and that many people are aware about mental disorders. But ADHD is always unheard of. 

There are psychologists and classes about mental health at school, but neurodevelopmental disorders, especially ADHD, are often overlooked... People kind of know about autism, dyslexia, etc. But have never heard of ADHD, met anyone with ADHD in their life or learned about it anywhere.

When I first suspected I had ADHD, I told my experiences to my friends and to one of my teachers, but all of them didn't recognize the disorder, my friends thought I just had depression (true, but that's not the point). Note that these people are pretty progressive and open-minded, a couple of my friends are also very keen on mental health and educating themselves about such topics, so I was very surprised when they told me they didn't even know such a disorder existed.

I feel like in the US ADHD is more recognised, and even if there are stereotypes and prejudice at least there is a bit of awareness. Here when no one even knows what I'm talking about really discourages me to even explain  it to others, like my family.

Depression or anxiety disorder for example, are well known, therefore people are more understanding and lots of psychologists are specialised for it, while an ADHD specialist is pretty rare to find. The fact that I live in a relatively small city doesn't help, but we do have resources for other mental health issues, like mental health centers or counseling centers. 
So I wonder how do we not have much awareness or knowledge about ADHD? 

I know like one famous YouTuber who has it and that's it, never met people who have ADHD or heard people talk about it, even my school counselor and psychologist basically don't know what is it.

We also have limitations on pharmaceutical use, I think only some Methylphenidate based medications and Atomoxetine are commercially viable in Italy, Adderall and Concerta for example are not prescribable, so if a those type of medications don't work for me I can do nothing about it.

I also wish I could formulate more coherent and eloquent conversations to help raise awareness and educate people, but when I do try to explain ADHD I turn into a fumbling mess, diminishing how serious of a disorder it actually is... people are already unfamiliar with it, what I want the least is for them to misunderstand ADHD as a person just being lazy and unmotivated.



TL;DR There is very little awareness of ADHD in Italy, although mental health is supposedly an important issue here. No one I talked to knows this disorder even existed and that really discourages me to explain to others what is it, at the same time I wish I could educate more people on it, but often it's exactly my ADHD which hinders my ability to do it.",I wish there was more ADHD awareness in my country
ADHD,"Story about my experience with my first and only psychiatrist. Last December I thought it was time to do whatever it took to become mentally stable. I finally found someone after months of searching. I couldn't believe it was happening. The thought of improvement caused me to make some pretty careless decisions. Things like not looking into the reps of their company before hand. From my understanding their company isn't too bad. The guy I'm about to mention is (in my opinion). I got there and was asked questions for about 45 minutes with someone from the front desk. After that exchange with I chatted with the psychiatrist. We talked for another 15 minutes asking me to describe symptoms, and asking me similar questions to the person who I'd previously spoken to. I did suggest Adderall would be a good place to start but I was hoping to get more rebuttal from the guy with the prescriptive power. There were no tests or questions about family medical history. It just felt like a conversation with someone who agreed I needed something.  I honestly can't even remember if I was diagnosed. More like a ""it sounds like you might have ADHD"". After a very brief chat he prescribed me Adderall. The same thing kept going through my head. Why did that feel so short and counter intuitive. I still think that to this day. Lets keep in mind that Adderall has helped so much and my life is 20 times better since starting it 3 months ago. It has come with its own side of nasty consequences and I cant even get in touch with the guy outside of appointments. I'm not even sure if I have ADHD or if its a different problem. I have yet to speak to him again since because I talked to a different one after seeing him. The regular time for these sessions is also 15 minutes so you get almost no time to get into the nitty gritty. Moral of the story: keep in mind of what you're looking for in a healthcare provider before picking one and try to get the best quality possible!",Be careful with your psychiatrist choices...
ADHD,"Today I experienced a clarity, a focus, a *need* to work and get shit done, a congitive sharpness, a motivation, that blew my mind. 

I’ve struggled my entire life with all the same shit you guys struggle with, and chalked it all up to me being lazy or undisciplined. Yesterday, at just shy of 34, I was diagnosed and prescribed Concerta. 

That shit absolutely blew my fucking mind today. An hour or so after I took it, I felt my brain turn into a less intense version of what it feels like to take mushrooms. Those of you that have tried mushrooms will know what I’m talking about. That feeling of only NOW being sober, that feeling of your brain being so much more effective and smart. That’s how this felt. Like I said - certainly not to that degree, but it was reminiscent.

The clarity and ability to focus that I had today was indescribable. The moment I got going, it felt like my drive and my need to work was unstoppable. 

I know it was only my first day, but shit, if I can focus even half this much every day, this will literally change my life. 

Just wanted to share that with you guys.

EDIT: Just to be clear - I understand that it wont be this profound forever.","Diagnosed yesterday at 33 as the posterchild for ADHD, took 36mg Concerta today for the first time. Here’s my feedback."

ADHD,"I’ve been reading a lot about the ways in which ADHD impacts people’s executive functioning and something that always catches my attention is how ADHD researchers (e.g Barkley) emphasise the role of working memory and self-regulation in the disorder. 

From what I understand the general (super simplified) idea is that people with ADHD can’t filter out external distractions, and can’t control their impulses to engage with these distractions, so they often get sidetracked and then can’t remember what they were doing before they got sidetracked because of the poor working memory. Also there is a problem with time-blindness and inability to learn from the past and see into the future, including delayed future consequences, so people with ADHD act ”in the moment” and struggle to motivate themselves to sustain future goals (especially if it requires some boring and repetitive action). Correct me if I’m wrong though 

However I’ve seen a number of people diagnosed with ADHD who seem to complain at internal distractions, rather than external ones, such as the person in this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/38u78f/chronic_day_dreaming_part_of_my_adhd_or_sluggish/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf which makes me wonder how many people diagnosed with ADHD feel more distracted by their thoughts and not the world around them? I’m gonna be talking to a doctor soon and while I relate to time blindness (I’ve been very noticeably time blind since childhood), I don’t really think I get sidetracked because of the world around me but I can’t really tell. I think my biggest distractions are my thoughts which I can hardly control. I don’t have an inner voice, only memories, random information, imaginary scenarios, conversations with other people etc. I always get sidetracked by my thoughts and zone out. Basically just constant daydreaming. I guess this could fall into the ADHD-PI or SCT category but I’m yet to find out

ADHD,"I just had to take one of those stupid timed logic quizzes for a job application, and I literally could not read the questions. It took me about a minute to read things and sort of understand what it was saying, and 30 seconds to actually start the problem and answer it. My brain feels like soup today. 

One question was just a jumble of times throughout the day like ""Shannon, Miguel, Hans and Andrea need to have a fifteen minute meeting sometime today between 9AM and 5PM. Here are the entire workplace's schedules, in plain text, no charts, and some of these are the times they are busy, but some are the times they are free. You have 2 minutes."" 

That was the only one I couldn't finish in time. 
:( And at the end there was a button that said ""Request Accommodation"" so I clicked it and it just said ""Ok, sent that request to the employer, it's up to them to respond or care."" like.... NOOOOOO DAMN IT!! 

Also as a side note, a lot of them seemed to be questions aimed at weeding out dyslexics like ""here's a random table of letters jumbled together, how many differences are between each column? How many columns are identical?"" This is for a retail furniture sales job! Why the hell would I need to know that!",I hate applying for jobs!

ADHD,"  So I recently left a job at Starbucks, as I found many aspects of the work to be overwhelming, such as the fast-paced environment, the need to multitask, rude customers, etc. For context, in addition to having ADHD, I also have issues with slow processing, particularly auditory processing, and have been diagnosed with ASD (although I lack many of the common symptoms).  I am also more of an introvert, which can make customer service jobs such as Starbucks even more stressful.  

So now I’m trying to find work that doesn’t require me to work fast all the time, and hopefully pays better than my previous job.  However, in many job listings, I constantly see phrases such as “candidates need to thrive in fast-paced environments”, “candidates must be able to handle high stress and meet short deadlines”, etc., and it’s honestly kind of disheartening.  Now, I understand that every job is going to have some degree of stress and I’ll likely have to work fast sometimes, but having to do it constantly is incredibly draining for me.

I do have a BA in Psychology, but for now I’m not planning to do anything in that field (i.e. counseling). So I’m wondering if anyone else on this subreddit struggles with fast-paced and high-stress jobs, and if so, have any of you managed to find jobs more suitable for you?",Slower-paced and low-stress jobs?
ADHD,"
So this is my first time back in school after a 1 year-ish hiatus. 

As someone with ADHD I have a lot of trouble with organization and whatnot but I’m working on it. My mind feels SO much more capable now but I still have tons of issues with organization and planning. 

Everything being online is kinda new to me but I thought I was fine.

The thing is, for the longest time now I’ve had massive anxiety when it comes to texts/emails/inboxes/etc. It is very easy for me to be overwhelmed or to be scared to check my inbox of texts or whatever.

On the first week of school I had a day where I had a bad GERD/IBS flare up and I was miserable the whole day and then I missed an assignment deadline (only 5% reduction which is fine). I sent my prof a dramatic email apologizing about being late and explaining myself. 

The problem is that because of that embarrassment I started being scared of checking my inbox for school.

So NOW, there’s 2 assignments that I ducking missed because I didn’t ducking check my inbox. They were already due fucking 2 days ago. Like I literally was not aware of the assignments until an hour ago. I need to complete 1 assignment to unlock and complete the other assignment. The first assignment is very small but I need to get 100% on it to unlock the following assignment. The problem is, because it’s fucking late because I’m an idiot, I can’t unlock it. So I have to email her. 

I feel like such a fucking moron. I want to scream. The thing is in my first dramatic email I already told her “sorry sorry it won’t happen again” and then “I don’t want to be a problem student” but here I fucking am 


What the hell am I supposed to tell her

“I’m sorry professor on top of the PLETHORA of other issues I have, I also have massive anxiety when it comes to fucking checking my inboxes because of past trauma involving a romantic partner and probably something else I don’t remember. Can you please unlock the assignment?” 

I would just take the L but she came across as the type of professor that wants to understand her students. 


Like on one hand, I don’t want to just make excuses. But on the other hand I want to explain myself and I’m so ducking embarrassed but I was already embarrassed about my OTHER late assignments.


Oh my god I want to scream",I feel so fucking embarrassed about the problems I have and I don’t know what to tell my professor (or if I should just not say anything)
ADHD,"Hi all,

About 12 months ago I resigned from employment and this anniversary has led to me doing some introspection.  I’ve come to realise that I’ve quit every full-time permanent position I’ve held on something of a whim.  In actual fact, with both of my two most recent resignations I went to work that morning not knowing I would quit my job later that day.  This means that across the six roles I’ve held in my life, the longest period of continuous employment has been 16/17 months and the average length has been roughly 10-12 months. 

There’s a pattern of behaviour here in so far as I become very frustrated/resentful with the structures/constraints that formal employment places on me as an individual.  This steadily builds up over time as the novelty of the new role and the new people starts to dwindle.  I also become frustrated/resentful with a lack of promotion and pay increase which (rightly or wrongly) I feel increasingly entitled to.

I’ve been lucky as on the two most recent occasions I’ve failed upwards so I have no serious regrets as such but I’m also aware my behaviour has meant I’ve taken on significant financial, professional and emotional/social risks without any prior consideration.

I’m looking to see if this is consistent with other people’s experience of the condition as well as to understand if there are any coping techniques to try and control such behaviours in the future.

Thanks in advance!",Exiting employment abruptly

So I've been actively searching out a diagnosis of ADD/ADHD since I was 17. Flash forward 7 years, 5 doctors, 9 moves, 3 states, 6 jobs (one actually being let go from bc of my inability to pay attention), and 2 schools and I finally slowed down long enough to find someone who would pay even the slightest amount of attention to the things I was saying. After years of job switching and bouncing around and just raw instability, things were starting to look good. I have a fiance, a job that can tolerate my neurodivergencies, and I finally managed to get myself back in school. My 1st quarter is winding down and things have taken. A turn for the worse. I'm in the middle of the intake process for actually getting diagnosed and I've been talking to my advisor but I have been fucking incapable of focusing for even long enough to do one assignment.

ADHD,"Alright you little bastards put down your gamestations and your tiktoks and listen up.   
If youre like me and have a 9-5 it can be really fkn hard to get moving in the morning, so here's a top tip.

TL;DR: Knock over a few little jobs first thing.  It will make life easier i swear.

I used to work in general engineering. Every day there was a handful of jobs on our plate and we'd chip away at it, staying more or less on top of it. Days would consist of phonecalls, clerical and shop work. I did my best to keep my one week/2 pages diary open on my desk all the time. Any little job, or change, or phonecall went in it. I did my very best to keep it stuck to my desk and updated with a few notes a day. I know many people here have trouble with diaries, and i used to just lose them or give up on them. The reason i think this worked for me was i made a rule that it never left my desk. 

So I would come in in the morning and have a look at the BIG JOB and want nothing to do with it. Instead of freezing up and wasting time, i'd try to have a look at all the little 5 minute jobs I was going to get around to. Call the guy, drop off the thing, etc.

I've found that if you have a crack at a couple of little jobs in the morning, you start to get your ball rolling. Finish off a couple of easy things and your brain gets a lil bump of dopamine. You can tick something off in that diary. Now you have a little momentum and all of a sudden that BIG JOB doesnt look quite as big.

An even if you achieved nothing for the rest of the day, you still did one thing, so the day wasn't completely wasted.","Win the morning, Win the day. Hot tip from an elder millennial."

Neither do those ""sleepy"" podcasts on spotify, I find them too boring and not long enough. I typically fall asleep to higher energy videos. Its usually ones I've seen before, and where the viewer isn't being directly addressed, like I'm listening to a conversation rather than being talked to if that makes sense (typically my go-to is Red Letter Media's ""best of the worst"" series)

The thing is, I know it's bad for me and I don't want to do it anymore. It's not an efficient way to fall asleep (I usually end up in a weird half-asleep, half-awake state for part of the night), and when I share a bed with my partner I need to wear headphones to sleep, which is very uncomfortable, plus the light from my phone bothers them.

ADHD,"Context: I was diagnosed with ADHD 7 months ago and I felt so relieved. I got good grades in high school, but always knew that I had trouble with concentrating and actually understanding/retaining information. I suffered a lot in university, but I’m in my last year and trying to study for the MCAT so that I can pursue my dreams of becoming a doctor. 

I have tried out medications since being diagnosed, here are my experiences: 

Vyvanse: 30 mg -&gt; 60 mg (3 months)
My concentration was slightly better but I was not any better at retrieving information. I felt like I had constant brain fog and found myself to be forgetting things (more often than not on it). I felt like a zombie and no emotions. 

Strattera: 40 mg -&gt; 60 mg -&gt; 80 mg (3 months) 
I hated it so much. I couldn’t sleep at all, I averaged maybe 7 hours a week, had constant migraines and headaches (I’ve never EVER had them before in my life) to the point where I would cry from the pain and I felt so depressed and anxious on it. Didn’t help my concentration at all.

Wellbutrin XL: 150 mg (1 month) 
Definitely improved my mood! I’m motivated to do my routine in the morning, I’m less irritated and I can calm myself down when I get upset. But it’s not helping my concentration at all. 

My doctor recently prescribed Ritalin IR 10mg twice daily, but I’ve had no effects from it. My doctor refuses to increase the dosage or prescribe me Adderall until my psychiatrist responds, which is understandable since it’s highly addictive, but I can’t help being upset. I’m so frustrated of switching medications and getting my hopes up thinking that I’ll finally be able to do the things I want to do. I look at this group for support and although I’m happy, I can’t help but feel jealous of others who have found the right medications for them. I want to be able to experience a clear head, being able to do what I love and actually sticking with it, and being able to retain information. I feel like I am SO close to being able to do it, like I have the potential to do amazing but I just can’t focus or bring out the information when I need it. My doctor doesn’t seem to understand this. He keeps telling me that I should try mindfulness even though I have in the past.

ADHD,"Hello! I just got diagnosed with ADHD in January, started on 18 mg of concerta originally, it was helping my anxiety and my mood issues, as well as my hyperactivity but it wasnt helping me focus so we decided to up me to 27 mg. The 27 was a bad move as it caused a really bad pounding heart feeling, make me so hyperware and just extremely uncomfortable for the first bit. I was more awake through out the day, and eventually I kind of settled into it after like 2 weeks, but I was still having off days where it hit me particularly hard. It almost made me worried that I was getting a high off it. It was again helping hyperactivity, mood,  and anxiety but I dont think focus. We decided to switch me to focalin xr and my psychiatrist converted the 27 of concerta over to 15 mg of focalin, and she was kind of worried that i would get the same like wide awake heart pounding and shes said from the beginning that maybe I just cant handle stimulants. The focalin didnt give me any side effects, no pounding heart no hyper awareness, nothing. I was extremely surprised but for the first hour or so after it kicked in I was sitting on my phone and I realized like I wasnt hearing anything around me. My house is extremely noisy and I wasnt picking up on any of it unless I took the second to think about it. I had gotten 3 hours of sleep the night before so im kind of chalking it up to lack of sleep or maybe a placebo effect, but I dont even know how to explain it, I had this feeling of I was so zoned in on my phone but at the same time my brain was working so slow that I wasnt like whole heartedly processing what I was doing on my phone. When I got up and walked around I felt like I was just so much slower. My brain almost felt empty for once, but at the same time I kind of felt claustrophobic because everything was so slowed down. It was like everything had been stripped away. I dont know if it was a good or bad feeling, if it means it was working or not? Im not someone that actively gets frustrated because they realize they cant pay attention, without meds my brain just kind of constantly wanders and I dont even realize im getting distracted because its so normal to me. Im thinking maybe the lack of sleep couldve been causing it, so I guess I will just have to see tomorrow, but genuinely, how do I tell if its working?

ADHD,"I was diagnosed with ADHD in third grade. I tired several medical options. Concerta worked best for me, no crying for no reason and stuff.

I can't really remember my first experiences with medication. But my parents told me that in 3rd grade I spent about 3 hours doing my homework. Much more has not got stuck.

I now take Concerta every day. 4 or 5 years ago the pressure was less and at the weekend I either forgot to take it and at some point consciously skipped it. Food tastes soo much better without it!!!

I love food :D

My experience with Concerta has changed me a lot personally. I don't know if others can confirm this, but the difference between with and without medication is very big.

I would describe myself as socially competent, friendly, extrovert and very interested in other people. I like interacting with other people and like myself. But without medication, I find it difficult to concentrate and adhere to the limits of others (family). I forget a lot and tend to be messy. 

With medication (especially at school), I tend to be quiet and reserved and I am less enthusiastic about the interests of others. I am more of an observer and passive participant in the conversation. But I can concentrate much better and I'm about to graduate from high school (Abitur). I am familiar with Anxiety attacks which are mainly reinforced by the medication. I've learned to deal with something like that and meanwhile I have no more problems with something like that.

Sorry this is kinda unstructured 

If you have any question about my experience, feel free to ask :D but i am not a doctor and do not want do give advice about medication like this.

ADHD,"So, like a lot of people, I'd like to get diagnosed/treated for adhd. Only issue? I'm scared of the cost.

So, I was wondering how you all maybe cut costs in order to get diagnosed and treated. For background, I live in the US (New England). I have okay insurance through my job.

I was wondering if I got my doctor to write me a referral, is it common to have the consultation covered? I don't think itd take much to get the diagnosis. I have the symptoms and I can easily describe them. My biggest red flags have always been my issues with sleep (for example, I have a fear of snakes. If I think of a snake while trying to sleep, my mind will fixate on it and it will keep me up for, no joke, hours. In a dark room. Just awake. Conversely, if I'm thinking about a topic I'm interested in, I will also spend hours just in my head without realizing it before I fall asleep) and my issues with time management - as in I just don't always realize time is passing? Like I randomly get so lost in my many thoughts that I disassociate from reality until I am late to everything.

I started realizing something was wrong when I asked this guy ""what are you thinking about?"" And he said ""nothing"". And I pressed on like ""you have to be thinking about something"" and he insisted that he really wasn't actively thinking about anything. I was baffled. I had always thought having constant engaging thoughts all the time about anything at all was normal!

I kinda realized it was adhd when I did a sleep study at my university and they said I had high brain activity. Searched it up and every internet link was about adhd. 

Even now, I'm supposed to be sleeping but I absolutely had to write up this post which I'm putting way too much information in I think but what the hell.

Anyways, id love to hear about the diagnosis process and costs. And if anyone's figured out a way to cut some costs, I'd love to hear it!",Best way to go about getting diagnosed?

ADHD,"TL;DR I think my psych views me as """"med seeking"""" and I feel like I have to walk on eggshells to get my needs met, especially after a recent miscommunication. I am not at an effective dose and I'm afraid to ask for a higher one.

From the beginning, I felt very scrutinized and judged by this doc. I have been diagnosed before, but by a provider in another state. Despite this, she insisted I get diagnosed within the practice and sent me off to someone I had never met who berated me for two hours about my childhood and trauma and made me fill out 3 different print outs of the tests you'd find online when you search ""ADHD diagnosis quiz."" He came back and said ""your scores are pretty high"" with a lot of suspicion and, ""well you are bipolar and people with bipolar generally have worse focus than people without"" (as if they're not extremely comorbid), but did inevitably diagnose me.

We have been ""titrating"" my dose for months and I'm only on 15 mg Adderall XR. My last psych stabalized my meds at 18.8 mg Adzendys (equivalent to 30 mg Adderall XR). During our last appointment, I thought she suggested at that time I take the last of my 10 mg with my 25 mg until I was due for a refill and she could change my script; this was also written on the after appointment summary I received. My last psych would go up in 10 mg doses like this and combine meds until my insurance would cover a refill, so none of this registered as out of the ordinary, and I was relieved I felt like I was taken seriously. After a week, I messaged saying that this was more helpful, but I'm still not quite able to perform the bare minimum at work or keep up with basic chores. She messaged back that I should not have been taking 25mg, and need to go back to 15 mg. I told her multiple times before, over message and during our last appointment, that 15 mg has barely any effect, good or bad. It's been 5 days since that message where I have been on this dose and after taking a dose that was a little more effective, I am incredbly aware of how difficult everything is.

I feel very insecure continually begging to up my dose, but this is having major effects on my life and like I have ADHD so I'm really impatient even beyond that. My numbers at work since I started working from home (so moving from a place with more accountability and social structure and an all around less distracting environment to one with no accountability where I literally have to do all my work on the same smart phone I scroll witter with) are abysmal and I have received multiple warnings and am afraid of losing my job. I am becoming a little depressed being unable to take on personal projects or follow through on plans with friends out of sheer lack of focus and distractibility. My partner has been busy lately and the house is in chaos because I am unable to keep up with the chores. I literally procrastinate and forget about doing basic tasks such as drinking water to the point that I've been having awful and painful flair ups bc I've got a chronic illness that requires I actually do just the bare minimum to stay healthy. My doctor does not seem to hear me when I express this and I'm all around am very disheartened. 

I am really scared to reach out for fear of even further judgement that may like I don't know get me put on some list or something, but I cannot keep living basically undiagnosed, it's miserable.

It just feels as though the more desperate I am, the less seriously my needs are taken, and the more I'm seen as untrustworthy and generally unworthy of meds.",I feel as though my psychiatrist does not respect me or my ADHD

ADHD,"I've recently started taking Ritalin again after not doing so for 3 years (the reasoning for quiting is incoming). I wanted to ease myself into a typical dosage for someone of my size, so I started with 10mg, then 20mg, and finally 30mg. I don't feel anything when I take the 10 and 20mg doses. But when I take that 30mg dose I am a powerhouse of efficiency. But during the 5-6 hours of pure concentration I feel like a soulless automaton (my reasoning for quiting 3 years ago). Just a blank slate working robot. It sucks. Without my meds I'm a B/C student, but with them (only the 30mg dosage) I am a straight 100 student. What do I do?!

ADHD,"I have an ADHD diagnosis - I'm a female who was diagnosed as a teen. I didn't have major behavior issues and I made good grades, but I was the stereotypical space cadet who would forget which locker belonged to me, or lock myself out of my car multiple times in a week, or show up in the wrong class. I have a child who has obviously been differently wired in some respect since he was born, basically. He was diagnosed as autistic at two, before his team said jk, he's just super adhd. 

What I sometimes struggle with, though, is that both of us (my son in particular) doesn't quite fit my idea of what ADHD ""should"" look like. Neither of us are hyperactive but both can be a little impulsive, especially blurting out/talking out of turn. We both make weird little noises all the time without realizing it and drive everyone around us nuts. Neither of us struggled with grades and both seem able to learn just fine in a regular classroom. We are both oblivious, but my kid definitely takes the cake on this one. He might have started back at in person school this week, and he might have pulled his pants down in class yesterday before reaching the restroom because he ""forgot where he was."" My attention is easily directed (sometimes too easily), but my son seems like he has major struggles with shifting focus/like he often doesn't process what's said unless someone gets his attention visually first. I also feel we both have some struggles with social cues, or are at least a little slow to pick up on them. We are also both really hard on ourselves/perfectionistic in our own ways, despite the appearance of being disorganized.

At my last job the exact same thing happened. In one night my manager went from loving me to hating me from then on, because she decided I was a trouble maker breaking rules on purpose. No matter how much I tried to insist I was just making mistakes (repetitively), she barely believed me. I ended up quitting because I couldn’t stand how she looked down on me from then on. 

My first shift at my new job I got told off and threatened with a fine. When I explained that I was new and hadn’t been told the rule they said they didn’t care. I went and cried in the bathroom, calmed myself down, went to the staff room and broke down in tears again lol. 

I’ve gotten in trouble more times now and every single time it gives me this sick, horrible feeling when I’m told off. I feel so simultaneously guilty, scared and angry, both at them for overreacting to my mistake and at myself for making such stupid, careless and meaningless mistakes too. 

I forget paperwork every single week too, which I don’t get in trouble for but I personally need for taxes, so I’m just losing money every week and yet I STILL DONT REMEMBER. 

I’m hating the feeling so much I’m looking at changing workplaces AGAIN. It would be my 9th workplace in two years. But that also makes me feel guilty; can’t I just stay in one job for more than a few months? Why can’t I just stick to it?? 

My absolute fear of getting in trouble may just be a way for me that RSD manifests, but the frustrating thing is that it isn’t helping me get out of trouble because the reason it keeps happening is because of my inattentive adhd that causes me to make careless mistakes.

ADHD,"Last month, I went to the dentist because I saw a small dot on one of my teeth that I thought could be a cavity on the left side of my mouth.

But when I went for the checkup, my shitty memory and nonexistent spatial reasoning skills had me say that the spot was on the RIGHT side of my mouth. So that's where they looked.

They also did a full exam and told me I had no cavities, and that I had a small spot where I had an old filling and that might be what I was seeing. (I was so happy because that never happens to me!)

The other day (about a month later), I was brushing my teeth and saw... a spot. But because of this incredibly bad memory, I could not remember if this was a new spot or the same spot. I also couldn't remember if the dentist had addressed it or looked at it. 

That's where my anxiety kicked in. I could NOT remember what went down, but my anxiety was telling me that this was a brand new cavity and I HAD to get it looked at immediately or it was going to develop into a root canal. I just can't relax thinking I'm going to have a medical issue if I don't do something.

... So I went back to the dentist about a month later. They looked at the spot and said the exact same thing: it's just a spot from an old filling. 

This shit is really, really humiliating. I feel like I'm this special brand of stupid because my memory fails and then my anxiety gaslights the shit out of me.

ADHD,"So I just had my psychiatry intake appointment (in NY, not sure if it matters, on medicaid / healthfirst), and was prescribed Wellbutrin

My biggest symptoms of ADHD are lots of decision paralysis, difficulty motivating myself to start tasks because of a feeling of overwhelmedness, my environments ending up overly cluttered / disorganized, constantly running late to things, etc. – along with some of the ""upsides,"" like the ability to hyperfocus on a thing once I get the inertia going to do so

My doctor told me that they generally do not prescribe stimulants out-of-the-gate, starting with non-stimulants instead.  ""If we find these aren't working well for you, and we want to seriously consider the stimulants, then we have to do a little bit more work – have some testing done""

I've absolutely heard of wellbutrin being prescribed for ADHD; an ex-partner of mine was prescribed it, and did amazingly with it

I'm concerned, however, because a lot of the posts I read here – as well as information elsewhere on the internet – seems to suggest that non-stimulants (esp. off-label wellbutrin) are considered a second-line treatment, if stimulants have issues.... which seem to the be the opposite of what my doctor is going with

I'm not sure of the logic here.  My guess is it's one of the following:

* Is it that stimulants are more of a controlled substance, so it's an easier thing to go with something like wellbutrin first?
* Is it because stimulants can have negative physical effects, such as cardiovascular health issues, so it's better to start with a non-stimulant from this school of thought?
* Is it because my main symptoms that I struggle with have a lot of overlap with depressive and anxiety disorders, and therefore wellbutrin would do better in addressing that intersection than a stimulant - as a drug that works for both depression &amp; ADHD?

I'm a little confused.  I definitely trust the reputability of this psychiatrist; she comes highly recommended by my therapist and my primary care doctor

Today I had a really big cry because it all hit me how I feel a layer of permanent dissociation from the world due to how out of hand my inattentiveness and internal monologue has gotten to, and I said to myself “okay enough is enough, starting today I’m going to meditate everyday, as often as I can to make myself feel more grounded and centred and actually present in reality” so I did that, with a bit of struggle, I managed to feel the most mentally grounded that I have for years and years now and I gotta tell you, it was the best I have felt mentally for years and years. 

The layer of dissociation caused by my severe inattentiveness and maladaptive daydreaming caused me to not be able to enjoy movies like I used to, caused me to not react appropriately in social situations, caused a lot of emotional dysregulation, and many other things on top of that, it was actually severely crippling to my mental health.

ADHD,"Story/Rant time! 

I recently purchased a Garmin VenuSq (smart watch) to help keep track of my activity and general health. Now, something I had been hoping to get along with the watch was a smart water bottle (keeps track of water intake &amp; will send reminders if you’re not drinking enough) which seems like an amazing tool for someone who routinely forgets to drink water because of ADHD! 

I went online and to my dismay, any smart water bottles I could find were only compatible with Fitbit or Apple watches so I turned to the Garmin reddit community in hopes that they might be able to direct me to one that I might have missed in my searches.

Boy was I wrong

Here are some of the replies I got to my post... (0 likes on post)

&gt; Wtf is a smart water bottle, is humanity insane? (13 likes)
&gt;&gt; I agree. Smart water bottles is where I draw the line. If you can’t keep track of how much water you drank, or you can’t tell you are thirsty, there is a problem (5 likes)

&gt; Garmin has a hydration widget! It means manual input but it’s fairly easy to use and can save you a ton of money because instead of a smart bottle you can buy a YETI bottle and you are set! (only decent reply, 0 likes)
&gt;&gt; (me) I have ADHD so manual input can be difficult for me to remember. I was hoping for something that could be a reminder for me to drink as well as keep track of my intake (0 likes)
&gt;&gt;&gt; I would say take a water bottle, put some tape on it and put lines on and set goals with how much you should drink before or at that time. Then keep the water bottle in view. Simple, and takes all of $1 for tape and a permanent marker (3 likes)

“If you can’t keep track of how much water you drank or can’t tell you are thirsty, there is a problem” THANK YOU KAREN! I’M AWARE THERE’S A PROBLEM AND IT’S CALLED ADHD AND IT’S SOMETHING I’VE STRUGGLED WITH ALL MY LIFE!! But THANK YOU for making me feel like an IDIOT for wanting to invest in something that is going to help me be a healthier human being! THANK YOU for reminding me of the struggles I have DAILY that regular people don’t struggle with at all! THANK YOU for making me feel like my my disability is something to be mocked!

And then there’s mr. smart guy telling me to use tape and a sharpie. If I can’t remember to tap my watch a few times and input my water intake, HOW IN THE HELL am i gonna remember to put tape on a water bottle, bring that water bottle with me and put it in plain sight, actually drink and refill said water bottle, and do it ALL AGAIN the next day?!?! And that’s not even touching on the fact that all of it takes motivation and personal accountability that I DON’T HAVE!!! 

Is it absolutely ridiculous that I need a watch &amp; water bottle to remind me to drink? Yes, it sure as hell is and I would VERY MUCH like it if I could remember to drink and keep track of my intake by myself. But the simple truth is that I CAN’T! I want to so bad! And I hate that nobody gets it and all they see is some stupid person who needs a water bottle to tell them when to drink....

This will be my first ADHD medication. What's it actually like? Of course, I trust my doctor in his choices, but at the same time, I want to be informed on what is and isn't normal, in addition to just having some preparation for what it will be like.  Truthfully, all the stories I've heard of amazing mornings but awful nights scare me.

ADHD,"This is long, but I am struggling with possibly being misdiagnosed so I would really value some input.

I've been struggling with focus, procrastination, paying attention, meeting deadlines, etc. for years now. I'm 28 years old and in my PhD program. I first really noticed that it was affecting my abilities when I was 18. But my parents note hyperactivity, procrastination and some academic struggles in my childhood. I've always just coped with it. Since starting my PhD program 2.5 years ago, I haven't been able to handle it well at all. I've been thinking about getting evaluated since my first semester. In this last year, my progress has completely halted. It's gotten so bad that I have developed depression symptoms, and I might quit.

I finally got evaluated. It was determined I don't qualify for an ADHD diagnosis because they couldn't determine a high enough number of symptoms in my childhood. Also, my grades in college were average for the most part. For each of my symptoms, they isolated each one and explained it with an alternative cause. I was diagnosed with Adjustment Disorder, with the triggers being a relationship breakup 1.5 years ago, the pandemic and the rigor of a PhD. I really disagree with their assessment.

Firstly, the triggers don't make sense because I've been struggling with these issues for years, and I told them that. Secondly, they acknowledged that I am, in fact, exhibiting enough clinically significant ADHD symptoms currently to be diagnosed with ADHD if they only looked at the current time. And yet, their suggestion was just to get talk therapy. I feel this entirely misses the point. Thirdly, they looked at each issue individually and gave it an alternative explanation, instead of taking it all together as a whole. For instance, for the grades and subjects I did struggle with, I probably just have a learning disorder. For my inability to make solid interpersonal friendships, I have anxiety. For my inability to get work done and focus, it's mild depression. And, they asked me for more time to finish my evaluation because they needed more supervision and time as they were unsure about my diagnosis. If I'm on the line enough that they were unsure, I feel that diagnosing me with something that absolutely does not make sense and just disregarding the whole picture was irresponsible.

This process took me 2.5 months and about $200. I do not think I was adequately evaluated, but I'm just not sure, with how arduous the process is, if it is worth trying to get a second opinion. I am currently getting therapy to address my lack of productivity, but it is not working. I have also been on SSRIs for 3 months with no real apparent change. I feel like I've used up my options, and I don't know what to do.

TLDR: despite my struggles and having ""clinically significant ADHD"" symptoms currently, I did not meet enough criteria for a diagnosis and was given Adjustment Disorder. Their reasoning was wrong IMO, but I don't know if it is worth trying to get re-evaluated.",Is it Worth Trying to Get a Second Opinion?

ADHD,"Wanted to share my experience with Foquest as medication for ADHD. It's a newer and possibly Canadian drug without a lot of reviews so this is just to add to that. I've been on it for almost a year now. I'm a woman in my mid-20s. 

I have gone from 25 to 35 to 45. Not much of a difference between the three- it just gets increasingly more powerful. I would say the **45 causes a bit of dizziness, though.** 

I remember being worried about feeling like a zombie or over-hyped, but **mood-wise I just felt completely normal.** The only difference was that I've always been the kind of person to fall asleep as soon as my head hits the pillow, and I would have to actually ""decide"" to go to bed. 

The first week I was doing things like vacuuming my room for the first time (ever). 

I found it much **easier to keep track of time-** I wasn't getting caught up in things and overestimating how much time I had. 

I wasn't scolded at work for dancing or speaking inappropriately- it was like **I was able to ""read the room"" all of a sudden. My voice isn't as loud and I don't sound as anxious.** More conscious with my words. 

School-wise, I have a 30-minute maximum attention span. I remember one day I realized that I had just spent **6 hours (straight) working on an assignment.** That has never happened before. In those 6 hours, I was **able to go to the washroom or get more coffee and still be able to return directly to my work.** 

If I went a day or two without taking them, I didn't feel any different. Just more tired and falling asleep earlier, and less motivated, but **there's no ""withdrawal**"" if you want to take a day or weekend off (at least for me, but I'm not a doctor so this is not advice). 

All in all, Foquest feels like a very safe choice- it's nothing drastic and if you aren't monitoring your symptoms you might hardly even notice. For me, it was an aha moment after a week realizing I had been actually following my schedule and getting things done.

ADHD,"Hey Reddit

I'm an actor. I've loved every messy and difficult part of pursuing acting for the last 3 years – but something happened to me last fall that had a more profound effect on me than I initially thought. This is a really difficult thing for me to talk about, but I've been suffering in silence for months because I didn't feel like anyone in my life would understand. 

I signed to a small agency in haste last spring after being dropped unexpectedly by my previous agent the previous fall (2019)  In hindsight, I should have taken more time to vet this person but I was just so excited at the prospect of being represented again that I rushed into things.

There were warning signs that this person was very manipulative, but again I ignored them and pushed them off

""That's just how the industry works""

Everything came to a head when I sent in a self-tape that was apparently all wrong (By industry standards it was perfectly fine). We spoke on the phone and she began to insult me by questioning my intentions of being an actor.

*""Why did you want to become an actor? Tell me honestly why this is what you want to do.""*

*""Do you think you're even ready for this profession?""*

*""I never have to tell my other clients these things""*

*""Have you even done a self-tape before? What's going to happen when I send you into an audition room?""*

These we're obviously incredibly insulting questions. I was signed to a top-tier talent agency for two years. I've auditioned for leads in Netflix shows, I've almosted booked small roles next to huge names in the industry. I get seen by casting directors on a regular basis who are notorious for being difficult to audition for. I am unflinching polite, professional, and kind. I love what I do and I've worked incredibly hard to establish myself as reliable and fun to work with.

But I'm also a people pleaser and a pushover sometimes, especially when someone is upset with me. I get scared...

In a panic, I blurted out **""I have ADHD.""** 

I was about to explain to her that sometimes my ADHD causes me to make small mistakes and miss details in breakdowns, and that I was sorry and I would make sure to double-check everything before I sent my next tape... but before I could even finish she started grilling me.

*""Oh, I see... Well, I knew something was up with you. You clearly have some anxiety.""*

*""Are you medicated?""*

*""Is this a new problem or an old problem?""*

*""Of course these things always come out later... so explain to me how you manage that.""*

*""How am I supposed to trust that you'll be able to do your job if you book a role? Film sets are stressful, how are you going to manage that?""* 

*""I have so many actors not working right not because of 'mental health'.""*

I just didn't even know what to say. I've never had someone so blatantly tell me that they thought I was incapable of doing my job because of my disability. The arts industry is generally a more safe space for disabled folks, at least in my experience. 

Long story short, I told this agent to kick rocks. She was batshit. My mentor said something that really stuck with me ""Would you let a friend speak to you this way? This is a bad relationship, and we don't stay in bad relationships."" 

Though I was lucky that my friends and family supported me through this ordeal, I'm still traumatized. It really opened my eyes to ableism in the film/ arts industry. My confidence is still so shaken. Every time I try to do something related to acting I almost have a panic attack. Her words just ring in my head over and over again. Things are going back to normal soon and I want to be able to jump back into it, but I don't know how to get rid of this fear. 

I want to be proud of my disability. I want to show other aspiring actors with developmental disabilities that they have a place in this industry. 

Hopefully this post is formatted okay, I know it's long but I tried to split it up so it would be easier to read.

So we’ll have to move from the house I’ve called home for nearly four years, a house I love, a house that my great grandfather built 90 years ago.

My wife and I have just had a row about the fact that I’ve been clinging on to the extremely small hope that we’ll be able to buy, and that I need to accept that we can’t. She’s right, and I do.

I’m exhausted just writing it all down, so my instinct is to just ignore it all, beg my wife for a few more days to come to terms with it.

I have wrote about the training package I am currently on in the past but am nearing my end date. This is more or less a rant/ questionnaire for all the good people on this subreddit.

&amp;#x200B;

So in the navy for my trade we have training packages, and one consists of presenting technical systems. I have worked it out that I can get two down before my upcoming sail and generally am fine with that. I am currently on 20mg vyvanse that has been a utter life saver.

So far I am just trying to pump away on these systems before my due date puts me in heavy water with the COVID shit having really fucked training up. My CoC is aware and is working with me but for anyone who has sailed before or has had to do similar things I have to ask; what did yall use to learn systems efficiently? I am planning on using the dopamine method via sugary drinks and coffee as a reward system and working from home isn't the best for studying these things.

ADHD,"Hi, I’m a recently diagnosed 29F with combined type. I wanted to know if anyone else has this issue, one of my main symptoms is zoning out when something is mundane, and I can literally feel my eyes unfocus and I go into autopilot. I recently started on Focalin XR and while it does help with quieting my brain, I’m still zoning out throughout the day. 

One of the more common times is when I’m driving, which is why I usually have my husband drive when we go somewhere together and it helps that I work from home. But does anyone else zone out when they drive? I have to really fight to make myself focus on driving, and have had near collisions in the past due to it, I always assumed everyone kind of drove on autopilot (like oh I’m home how did that happen?) and only after was diagnosed know that it’s not that common haha. 

Did other meds help you? I’m considering switching to Adderall as I’m getting some jaw clenching with Focalin but the zoning out is still my main problem even tho it’s definitely helped with other areas. Any other tips on staying focused while driving??

ADHD,"Hi all! New to this sub, diagnosed ADD (non hyperactivity) in 1993.

Just curious if any of you have something specific you do to get motivated when a task needs to be done that you REALLY do not want to do. 

For instance I'm having issues with my car, I'm an above average mechanic and incredibly inclined, but the last thing I want to do after work is pop my hood and start voluntary work. The thing is, once I get into it, time blurs until it's done. My wife calls it autopilot, my mother, who was head of CHADD for NJ (my hero), calls it hyperfocusing. It's that first step that I have issues with, it's so easy for me to convince myself another time is a better time. Love to hear your thoughts.

But the thing is I haven’t been feeling much. If I take them at 9 by 12 I feel exhausted .

ADHD,"First post here, and first Reddit post! This is a bit of a rant as well, but there are some questions I have that I hope I can get answers to. To start, I am not yet diagnosed however I have recently learned that my Mother, Brother, and Uncle had been diagnosed with ADHD. I have taken every online self-test, lurked here for the past couple of months, and I relate to a huge majority of the experiences I read about here.

I first suspected I had ADHD around six months ago (I think?) I had heard about some of the symptoms from who knows where and went on to read more about it and take some online tests. From there I was half in denial, and half thinking, ""How much more obvious could it have been, looking back?"" I remember checking most except for maybe two boxes on these questions and thinking, ""Doesn't everyone do that?"" No bud, as it turns out, most people don't lack the motivation to brush their teeth or to learn to drive, don't have crushing impulsivity, or cannot process emotions.

It became obvious that the constant struggle in school and on to college was not due to sheer laziness or lack of intelligence. Failing classes, forgetting to do work, failing to turn in completed work, the massive unorganized zipper binder, useless after school tutoring, multiple detentions, getting kicked out of kindergarten, the utter bombing of my college classes (two semesters in a row), scoring academic probation for poor performance, a late arrival to everything, not absorbing any information, and chilling in the library instead of going to calculus class altogether (but still attending the exam for some reason??)

I've discovered that other people don't typically have a radio in their head with the same playlist and with no control over it (It was playing the Day-O Banana Boat song today btw). And let me tell you, I wish I had a better singing voice because you better believe me when I tell you that my family doesn't appreciate the entertainment of me yelling ""DAAAAY-O DAaaaAAy-O"" from my bedroom. My dogs must think I'm insane when I bark at them (is this Tourette's syndrome or hyperactivity?) I'll also start unwanted games of tag with family, and I'll pace around the house with no goal in mind (I'm in my early 20's).

To get back on topic... so I expected I had ADHD (not knowing my family history at this time) about 6 months ago IIRC. Two months from there (4 mo. ago) I wrestled all week with my insurance's garbage website to change my doctor (I hadn't seen my old pediatrician for two years previously... gotta love procrastination.) After getting my new card in the mail... I did nothing for two months after that (did I think the appointment would make itself, hello?) Two months later (2 mo. ago) I battled myself for a week to make a phone call to make my first appointment (I'll do it tomorrow for sure... Oh would you look at that, it's the weekend now, guess I have to wait some more!) So it's finally time for my first appointment with my new PCP at the end of February.

At my first appointment, we restart medication for an unrelated health issue (Asthma, a lung condition), and I mention my concern that I have ADHD. My doctor doesn't diagnose so she sends a referral for Neuropsychology. They set up an appointment for a month later to adjust my lung medication if needed. They also tell me to call them if the referral doesn't call me to make an appointment for my ADHD diagnosis. Unrelated, but a week later I get my COVID vaccine (be safe people!) That next week I send a message through Mychart letting the office know I haven't got a call.

They then respond explaining that they don't accept my insurance and it must have been why I didn't get a call from them (""Why did you refer me there, then?"" I want to say. They ask me to find someone who accepts my insurance they can fax my referral to. Cue the garbage insurance website cycle again and after hours of searching for a provider, I give them the number of a provider. The time for my follow-up appointment rolls around a month after the first. We adjust my lung medication, and they say that the referral had been approved. My PCP says to call them again if the psych doesn't call me. Weeks pass, and I find that **THE PROVIDER LISTED ON MY INSURANCE WEBSITE DOESN'T PRACTICE ANYMORE?**

Repeat some back and forth until my next appointment and turns out my second personal recommendation falls through as well, turns out that the office had several negative reviews. That, and they didn't respond to my voicemail or calls after I missed a call from them. So here we are, three strikes down. I send over another office, making sure to confirm they do still exist before I go through this headache again. Everything seems in order.

So after the referral posts as ""Approved"" in Mychart, I fight myself for a week to make a call to make an appointment, but the weekend rolls over and today is the Tuesday I called (Anxiety?) So at like 2:00 PM, I gather enough motivation to call the office and even compose out possible paths the conversation can go on a notepad (Why? I don't know.) The receptionist tells me they aren't accepting new patients... *sigh* **BUT** they do give me two local places they have been referring people to. I'm glad I researched because it turns out one of them claims they provide ""spiritual treatment."" I go with the other option and miraculously they have an opening as soon as **tomorrow**. The receptionist said that is ""Unheard of"" and that the waitlist is up to the end of April. You better believe I took that opening.

But... they did warn me that they do not prescribe stimulant medications to unemployed people. I am currently unemployed by choice because of a fear of COVID in our United States, where wearing a mask seems to be optional in a redder state (remember my lung disorder?) I did complete my second vaccine, but I still fear for my family, as they are not yet vaccinated, and are vulnerable. Anyways my question is, are non-stimulant medications worse than stimulant medications? What should I expect from my appointment tomorrow?

ADHD,"\*thinks about posting for advice\*

\*wonders if I'm even in the right place\*

\*thinks I should probably search to make sure this hasn't already been covered in another post\*

\*gives up, thinks about not posting\*

(yeah, I'm definitely in the right place)

(TL;DR at the bottom)

So here's the thing. I had a gnarly panic attack last week (9/10) that necessitated a trip to the ER. Those details are not necessary (of course I was ignored/treated like garbage), but I'm trying to figure out the big picture and I'm just not sure how I can go on. I need to know if there are others out there with this same combination of stuff and what you're doing to manage it, because I feel like I've been through every possible option and nothing is working.

(I am seeing a therapist and several providers who are all very nice and supportive and I am not looking to just try something without running it by all of them. I just need some outside validation/support/ideas from others in the same situation.)

I have a lot of ADHD and anxiety.

I also have a lot of depression and fatigue. I have sleep apnea, which I've had my entire life, or at least since I was a teen. It went undiagnosed for a long time because doctors assume that BMI is the only indicator, and I'm a fairly skinny dude. Anyway. Sleep apnea and depression not only share symptoms, but they exacerbate each other: depression makes me want to sleep constantly, and sleep apnea ensures that my sleep is not restful. The apnea is successfully being treated via CPAP, which I love and have no problems with, but it doesn't stop me from feeling fatigued all the damn time.

(I also have some trauma, PTSD, gender + body dysmorphia...I think that's about it)

\*tangent check\* - okay, not too bad so far

Here's what my life looks like: I'm tired all the time, from the time I wake up until the time I go to bed. I am also frantic all the time about not being able to do all the stuff I need to do.

This is, obviously, a problem.

I found out a couple of years ago that \[substance that I am not allowed to mention here\] cures my anxiety completely. Yay! Except it comes with its own lovely set of side effects (memory loss, couch lock, increased fatigue), and it left me without the ability to do creative work. I'm a creative person—I love writing music, taking photos, making films—and while \[substance\] is lovely for inspiration, I found that all I was doing was \*thinking\* about this stuff all day and not \*doing\* any of it.

If I took an adderall or ritalin, I could get stuff done for about 4 hours. But most of the time, I didn't feel like taking it. I'd light up instead and just keep on doing nothing.

So I decided to quit about a month ago. Yay! I also started exercising, eating better, and generally trying to get out of the rut I've been in. That actually has been going pretty well.

Along those lines, when I saw my sleep doc a couple weeks back, I asked if I could switch to Concerta, in the hopes that extended release would keep me going for longer, and I could get into a rhythm of just taking it every morning. She was on board with that and we agreed to start on the lowest possible dose.

I took exactly one Concerta and then had a panic attack. That really set me back. I'm scared to take meds now, and that is a very bad thing (that I am actively working through with my providers). I'm not sure whether the Concerta directly caused the panic attack, but the two are close enough together that my body doesn't want anything to do with pills right now.

So what I'm feeling is I have to go back to \[substance\] because that's the only way I have ever figured out to successfully manage my anxiety. And just live with the fact that I won't be able to do the creative work I want to do. (I'm sorry if this isn't permitted. I'm not trying to talk about substance abuse here, just the choice of how to manage my particular combination of symptoms and to get some advice from others.)

Is anyone else dealing with this combination of things? How are you managing?

\*double-checks rules to make sure everything is cool\*

\*slight panic about where to put the TL;DR\*

TL;DR LOTS of ADHD/anxiety but also depression/fatigue. Anything I take to manage my ADHD/fatigue increases my anxiety, and anything I take to manage my anxiety increases my depression/fatigue. Also, a certain substance cures my anxiety, but leaves me creatively unfulfilled. But when I stopped, I started having panic attacks.

I feel like every time I talk to someone (with ADHD, or any other mental issue) and they start new meds, it seems like they know exactly how the med is effecting them and whether it’s positive or negative, and I genuinely never feel like that.

My partner and I are both DX and medicated, and while we both also love to cook, love to try new things and we do order out about 1x/week, after a year in pandemic lockdown we had run into our wits end when it came to figuring out what to cook and what groceries to buy for it while staying in our budget.  A few weeks ago I had a complete meltdown over it and refused to make any further decisions over food. It was bad. I ate little more than cereal and rage for several days.

After I calmed down and thought rationally about the situation, I decided to throw some money at the problem, and I looked into recipe planning services before settling on one. It does have an annual cost after the free 10 day trial, which is not a trivial amount of money to spend up front. We had briefly considered a meal delivery kit service, but ultimately decided that it wasn't best for us and our needs.  

Friends, we are only on our second week but this has already been a game changer for us. I wanted to share my experience for anyone else out there who is struggling to figure out how to feed themselves without going crazy, broke, or bored to death.

# What has a meal planning service done for us ADHDers, exactly?

1. It plans as many meals for us as we want it to during a 1 week period, so **no more having to think about how many meals we can get out of what we are buying for the week.** We were both really bad at that and usually ran out of any meaningful amount of food by Friday.
2. It will incorporate ingredients that we already have in our pantry, so **we don't have to figure out what TF to do with the rest of that bag of &lt;*****insert random ingredient here*****&gt;**.
3. It will re-use some of the same ingredients for several meals, so **we get the benefit of economies of scale and it saves us money in the long run.** For example, the first week we tried it, carrots were used in 2 or 3 different recipes and in very different ways so we didn't get sick of it.
4. It's adding waaaaaaay more variety to our diets because **we don't have to think up new and creative things to make.** Hello novelty, goodbye food boredom! Makes our particular brand of ADHD brains happy!
5. **It has put a ton more fruit and veg into our diets** because I told it that we both have some weight goals to hit.  We're both also emotional stress eaters who love our carbs. Not that carbs are evil or bad, but it did mean that we focused more on buying and making those than on produce, which has not helped our health.
6. On the above point, because almost everything we buy now has a specific purpose, **the fruit and veg aren't going bad because we couldn't be arsed to figure out how to use them**.
7. It connects to freaking Instacart and Amazon Fresh and tells it exactly what quantity of each ingredient to get, so **we don't have to spend the time to search for everything on our list one by one and also figure out how much of each thing to buy.**

# What doesn't this meal planning service do for us?

1. It doesn't send you any of the ingredients.  You still have to procure the goods.
2. It doesn't make you want to wash the dishes any more than you did before.  Sorry, mate.
3. It doesn't give you energy if you're feeling too tired to cook, although not having to make any decisions about what to make and how to make it has greatly reduced the mental load.
4. It doesn't plan more than a week at a time, so you can't just do your entire month at once and be done with it. Which is fine for us because it affords us the right level of flexibility for our needs.

&amp;#x200B;

# Bottom Line: This is Why a Meal Planning Service is ADHD Friendly

1. **It cuts waaaaay down on the mental load** of making decisions about what to cook, what to buy how much of each ingredient to get, how to use what you already have, etc.  That amount of decision making can be so overwhelming.
2. **It has given us so much more variety**, and our ADHD brains love the novelty!  Like I said, we both like to cook and try new things, but coming up with what to try, finding a decent recipe, and figuring out how to make it work without buying a bunch of ingredients you'll never use again is hard AF.
3. **It's balanced out our diet more**, which helps out with the ever-present guilt of not eating ""healthy enough"". Okay, some of that might also be our own personal food issues from childhood, but gravitating towards feel-good comfort food and away from fresh produce is not uncommon in our community.",How a Meal Planning Service Can Be ADHD Friendly
ADHD,"One year ago I was in my final year of undergrad for a design program. I was busy working part time at my college pub as a FOH team lead and trying my best to finish my thesis and graduate from my program. I started college back in 2013 and after a one year art program and about 2 years off from school, I was not about to fail and be forced to come back for another year. I was ready to begin my life as an adult….  
 

Fast forward to a year and while I did manage to graduate (THANK WHATEVER GOD THERE IS!) I I feel like I am much worse off than when I was almost failing classes in school… I am currently:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Unemployed
2. Ghosting a potential freelance client
3. Putting off my volunteer design work
4. Relying on my dad and the government for money so that I can feed myself and pay my rent
5. Absolutely miserable and completely bored with life. 

I know that my circumstances are not that different from others right now, and I am not special in anyway, but fuck this sucks!  
 

I haven’t improved anything about myself in one whole year. I am still a fucking mess, and I feel like even though I went to school I still have no skills that will make me stand out in any way to employers. I also just don’t even know if this is the industry (UX/UI Design) I want to be in.  
 

I seem to have this crippling like anxiety over doing anything that could potential help me. All I want to do is eat good food, and watch Superstore with my boyfriend on the couch all day long, but I also want to be successful and happy and have some kind of purpose in life. 

Anyways I don’t really know where I am going with this, I think younger me would be so disappointed and embarrassed with how I turned out. She wanted to make something of herself and prove to everyone that she was amazing and her life was interesting, but the older I get the more I realize that is just not the case. I am so average and so boring and kinda pathetic to be honest lol. I can totally understand why I don’t have very many friends, and I feel sorry for my parents for having such a loser of a daughter.   
 

ANYWAYS, I think I’m having all these feelings because I very recently started taking medication (18mg of Concerta) and I just kinda thought It was help solve my problems. I thought they were working and helping the first week of being on them, but now I am not so sure. I also find myself questioning my diagnosis A LOT. Some days I think “of course I have ADHD its so obvious!” And other days I think “Maybe you are just a lazy piece of shit with no potential”.  
 

For whoever managed to get through all of that, you are ✨a rockstar✨ Thanks for taking time out of your day to read through my brain dump. 💖

ADHD,"So this is going to be a long one. Disclaimer: I'm not saying people with ADHD/ADD are dramatic, I'm calling myself such a way because I'm unsure on it so get ready for a whole rant.

DOUBLE DISCLAIMER: Please do not diagnose me! I'm not asking for anyone to be a doctor, just need some advice with a side of ranting :')

So as a kid, I didn't think I had much problem with concentration when it came to classes, most likely because they didn't bore me and I actually enjoyed them for the ones I hated, my attention was zero. Obviously, I'm not saying that concentration is the biggest symptom, it's just the branch of multiple. Anyways, I look back at myself and noticed I was a stranger kid, still am I'd say, and I would also add that I had a very unusual amount of energy in my body and I would be hyperactive even when I'm on the verge of fainting in exhaustion because I HAVE to move. Also fidgeting, I need those to calm down and stimulate. Other than that there's the more serious symptoms which I've seen people with ADHD have which I relate to so much.

At the same time though, I'm scared to just go to a doctor and say, ""hey, I feel like I have ADHD can I get a diagnosis?"" Because I don't know how that would work. I would really like to though because ever since online schooling, I've been getting 100x worse and I feel like punching a wall in anger, frustration and sadness because I hate this sm. I can't do anything but I do something but it's nothing at the same time you know? (Hopefully that makes sense)

I'm just rambling at this point but what I've been wanting to say is, how does one get a diagnosis? Is there some kind of procedure? Do I have to go to a psychiatrist?

ADHD,"For those of you who use this app, I’m not sure if I did this correctly. Normally for my adderall, I never have an issue getting a new script sent in every month since I could just text my friend who worked for my doctor on my fill days. 

My friend moved jobs recently, so I tried to request the refill on the Walgreens app this time. My doctor does the 3-month thing, so technically even if it says “no refills available,” shouldn’t I have a refill left if it was sent two months ago? I know controlled substances are handled differently, but the option to refill was there so I clicked it. Do they still have to confirm with my MD? I’m just nervous now because it says delayed (tomorrow is 30 days), but my doctor is out tomorrow so I’m not sure what I’ll do if she’s not there to give them the go ahead to fill it...

ADHD,"I’m a 23 year old female and I was diagnosed with adhd 2 years ago. I didn’t medicate for it because I was still learning how adhd effected me specifically and developing methods to combat it. These methods are much less effective when doing full time university online so I decided to ask my doctor about medications and she prescribed me vyvanse. 

I’m around 1.5 weeks in and finding it’s working and I’m focused, but also feel really really restless. I wouldn’t describe it exactly as anxiety, but I constantly feel like I’m ABOUT to get a big adrenaline rush or something and nothing satisfies that energy really. 

I’ve read mixed things about what symptoms fade and the adjustment process. I was hoping to hear some first hand thoughts from anyone using this prescription.

ADHD,"I’m looking for some advice as my head is about to explode. I’ve (27F) been in a relationship with an amazing guy (28M) for 5.5 years and he has untreated ADHD. I’ve educated myself for years trying to understand it and how to handle his outbursts and downright awful actions, I even bought him a book which he refused to read. Fast forward to now, we’ve broken up more times than I can count based on his actions which push me away. He has screamed at me, broken my things, threatened me, blocked me, given me the silent treatment for over a week, told me to pack my bags more times than I can count and then I realise there’s no helping him so I agree and leave. Usually within 2-4 weeks, he comes crawling back begging me to get back with him, promising he will research his ADHD and speak to someone and put some steps in place so I can help manage it too. Stupidly, because I love him, I forgive him and believed him. He’s nice as pie for a month or so and then the issues start again. He promises me he’ll talk to someone or at least research into it and he doesn’t which causes me to feel resentful towards him.

 To give you some context of my current situation, he bought himself an investment property 18 months ago for himself without telling me. He moved into it and I moved in with him part time until we saved for our own place. He kicked me out over 3 times and threatened me to pack my bags over 10 times. He then took a low paying job (part-time) and a high cost car therefore he couldn’t afford the mortgage although he told me he could, struggled with the financials and lied about it until eventually he kicked me out for good in November and moved back to his mums as he couldn’t afford to live there. After I forgave him (again), he promised me we would then get a place together as soon as someone rents his apartment. Someone is renting his apartment and I have completed all of the relevant steps in order to get us our first home (which is long overdue after 5 years) and I’ve done all of it by myself whilst he sits back making excuses. He then decides 3 months after looking for a property to dictate the budget (I had no say) and decrease it by £20k so he can have no less than £18k in his bank account after we agreed a fairly low budget to begin with. Every week for the last 3 months, he’s brought up new issues whether it’s relating to money or towards me and tries to make me feel like I’m doing something wrong when in my eyes, I’m just trying to find us a house together. 

I’ve been feeling pretty low during this last lockdown and I confided in him as he should WANT to support me but he threw it in my face and told me how much he hasn’t enjoyed my company recently and he’s not committed to a house due to my unhappiness. The next week, he completely changes and says how much he loves spending time with me and is even discussing our children’s names in the future?

The guy is all over the place with his emotions and I get the backlash. This last year, he’s had 3 jobs, 3 cars, 3 phones, argues with all of his coworkers, argues constantly with me and makes out he’s innocent in every scenario. He knows he has ADHD but he refuses to accept it. This last week, he’s blocked me, ended the relationship, told me he doesn’t love me and I’ve ruined his life all because I was frustrated that he broke his promises to research into his adhd, help me with the house search and not to give me the silent treatment.

The resentment I feel is crazy, I don’t believe anything he says anymore as he’s lied that many times about researching into his adhd so he can understand himself more and end this vicious cycle we are in. He thinks I’m the problem, he thinks I have a temper but the only time I’ll react is when he dictates and lies to me and he will sit there and point the finger to my responses to his actions and end the relationship.

ADHD,"For those who don't know this yet, I apologize for the rabbit hole y'all are about to join me on.

For context, I've got some personal reasons why I need to know  ASAP  whether this should affect the birth control I currently use, but I think this could also be a bigger discussion about knowledge gaps in medicine, and why your primary/family doctor should know more about ADHD and how it relates to other Healthcare decisions.

Somehow in all the ADHD research I've been reading and articles about ADHD and women, I just learned today: ADHD symptoms and fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone may be connected. As in, higher levels of estrogen trigger a release of dopamine, and so when estrogen drops in the cycle, ADHD symptoms get worse. The hormone progesterone is suspected of also making ADHD symptoms worse, though I'm still trying to understand the mechanism, because the birth control i use is the synthetic version, progestin.

Studies are really limited, but I've been on the progestin releasing Nexplanon for over 2 years and am just about to get it out because I've been getting my period twice a month suddenly. Although it didn't last as long as it should, I liked it a lot more than the pill and other birth control options aren't good for my anxiety or require too much maintenance/routine/working memory. 

I've been a lot happier in the last few months, which coincides with more positive life events and support I've been getting from friends and family, but also coincides with the changes in my period. I don't think it's possible to tease out the variables, but now I'm worried that getting the nexplanon re-inserted (an out of pocket expense of $350 in BC, Canada) will cause me to spiral back into the depression I'm just coming out of. 

I take the maximum amount of adderall every day, and it would be interesting to know if a different birth control would mean that it would work better for me- but unless the changes are significant, I would rather try to stay on the same birth control and use other habit/exercise/dietary methods in addition addition medication and therapy to manage my ADHD. In the back of my mind, I wonder if women taking stimulants also have nexplanon implants expire sooner, if anyone else with Nexplanon could answer whether they had a similar experience?

Since I'm about to book my nexplanon replacement procedure, I'll be asking my doctor about this for sure. 

What do you all think? Have your doctors ever asked you about how your ADHD symptoms are impacted by the birth control you're on or your regular hormonal cycle? Studies also discuss the role that menopause &amp; pregnancy affect ADHD symptoms from the perspective of estrogen-dopamine interactions.

""*[Hormones and Medications](https://ercare24.com/adhd-and-pms/#:~:text=While%20the%20synthetic%20progestins%20in,negative%20effect%20on%20ADHD%20symptoms.)
Part of how most ADHD medications work, and amphetamines, in particular, is through increasing dopamine levels or through making the brain process the neurotransmitter more slowly. It makes sense then that estrogen and progesterone would affect how the brain processes medications. For instance, taking estrogen generally makes ADHD medications more effective, and taking progesterone makes them less effective. While the synthetic progestins in birth control pills are not progesterone, there is some evidence that they can cause side effects similar to ADHD. Although research has not yet been done, it seems reasonable to conclude that birth control pills might also have a negative effect on ADHD symptoms""

TL;DR: on a personal level, I'm starting to think about how birth control may impact my ADHD for the first time, and want to know if Nexplanon is impacting the effectiveness of adderall, and whether I can offset any negative  affects through other means.

I can usually take breaks during weekends and time off, however, with covid, I have had to take it nearly every day with no long breaks. As a result, I really think my tolerance has gone up quite a bit as my medicine is less effective and wearing off quicker. On the occasional days that I am able to skip, I feel incredibly fatigued and sleep the day away. Not to mention, working at home has not been the best for my adhd, so the ineffectiveness of my meds is really hurting me.

Throughout my life sespecially when i was younger i was super hyper and all the steriotypical symptoms of ADHD all my friends always told me that i had it and even some teachers told me i had it in jr high but i didnt want to belive them because of the narrow minded opinions of what my father said about it when i was younger and the social stigma of medications. 
I have been on adderall for the last 6 months... only 5 mg caps. It seems to help and i feel better when i take it i get alot more accoplished and overall feel better.
My issue lately is i feel guilt because im mostly just lazy and unproductive and un able to get basic easy shit done like chores and stuff that should just be easy like they are when i take my medication... i havent felt hyper so much latelyit comes in waves ... or used to i only get like one hyper day a month layely.  
Like i said before latey i just feel super lazy and unmotivated even though i eat heathy get excersise, have a decent sleep schedule and dont drink much alcohol mambe one or two after work here and there and maybe some on a friday night. I dont feel as ""spry and energetic as when i was younger i get that im an old man now kinda and that might be normal but seems like vasic stuff is such a ordeal so i just play videogames or watch iv feeling like shit about not being able to get anything done cuz any time i try i just cant focus or im onto the next thing before im even done the first thing. When i wasnt taking meds even talking to people i found myself just losing my train of though bcause in my head id get so far forward in my sentence that my id forget wat was actually coming out of my mouth... sounds so dumb i know but it was super frustrating!Taking my meds helps but i think i need to up my dose or sonething cuz its not as effective as it used to be. I just cant help but feel bad about it because of the stigma i was taught growing up. 
I guess im just writing this to vent or ... i dont even really know why... i guess to see if any of this is valid.

ADHD,"Here's my life story about food lol, TLDR at the end.

I am recently (officially) diagnosed with ADHD and starting on a generic form of adderall. I managed to obtain an engineering degree and get my current work from home office job all while off medication and, while it was a nightmare logistically speaking, I was at least eating food more or less regularly. With the exception of caffeine fueled hyperfocused binge work all nighters lol. 

I have always been sensitive to heavy/high carb foods making me sleepy, but now that I am on medication, its way worse. In the past, if I was busy at work and didn't have time to take lunch I would throw on a pot of water and make rice or pasta and top it with sauce or butter, and whatever leftover protein I had in the fridge (if there was any). It's low effort, fast, and filling. On occasion these dishes would make me a little tired, but some green tea or a lot of water would do the trick and I would be good to go. Now, even a rice bowl or a dish with a little pasta will nearly knock me out (if I can manage to eat it). No amount of coffee, tea, soda, water, or jumping jacks will help. Usually it's so bad I can hardly focus on the computer screens in front of me with broad daylight coming in from the patio door next to me.

On top of all of that, I work at a medium-large bookkeeping and accounting firm doing all the back end admin. We recently got rid of the other admin worker too. You can imagine that any year we are busy right now since taxes are due soon. But with Covid issues, this year is insanely busy, worse than we have ever seen. I am working 55+ hours a week and hardly have time to cook/prep/make lunch and snacks. And all of my previous eat snacks/lunches are now out of the question with my medication. At this point, I've stopped eating. Today, I've been in the office 6 hours already and haven't eaten a bite because I just don't have time to go make food, and my lunch delivery is completely wrong and disgusting.

ADHD,"Inspired by an earlier post on using music to keep track of time in the shower I figured I'd share something that works for me. 

After hearing about the pomadoro method,  I bought a cheap mechanical kitchen egg timer that can go up to 60 minutes and it's a real game changer.
I don't actually follow the full pomadoro method as it's a bit too ridged for my brain. 

I just set it just as I start a task - to what time I think the task should take: e.g. 15 minutes for a shower,  10 minutes to clear my inbox,  60 minutes to clean up a corner of the kitchen. 
For things that definitely should have a deadline it helps keep me boxed in and for things like cleaning where I might actually reach ""stretch goals"" (like cleaning two corners of the kitchen) it helps me get started and set a minimum goal that I can tap out at if I'm still struggling at the end. 

It's great because:
- It provides an audible cue to stay on task as you can literally hear the seconds ticking by. 
- It's easy to check how much time has passed at a glance.
- It never runs out of charge or loses my settings due to software updates or glitches. 

An added bonus over using my phone as a timer, it doesn't have reddit or social media notifications built in and so it never pulls me off task to fun distractions.",Time handling tip!

I specifically need help for things like writing and reading. When I’m doing those, I can’t really listen to music or have TV on because I’ll focus on the words of the background instead of what I’m working on, but I need background noise or else I can’t think.

For painting or other art I like things that have words that I can just listen to in the background.

In late 2019 my situation became unbearable as I was failing school, had no job, and to top it off I was struggling with severe nerve pain in my arm from a botched blood draw.

I ended up going to a psychiatrist and he prescribed me lexapro 10 mg/day which I took for a month. I ended up getting sexual side effects and fatigue, and my doctor thought I should try trintellix instead. Once I started that the sexual side effects dissipated fairly quickly but I was left with the fatigue which for me was honestly much worse. I started on 10 mg/day and over a period of 6 weeks increased my dose to 20 mg/day because I thought a higher dose would be more beneficial.

I have taken 20 mg/day for more than a year now and it has done absolute wonders for my depression, and my OCD, BDD and anxiety symptoms have decreased too although not as much and I still struggle with that. However, the trintellix has made me very tired and lethargic, and I lack motivation to do things as well as before.

As I said earlier I also strongly suspect I have ADD/ADHD. It’s been something that has plagued my entire life since the age of 5-6, but I still haven’t received a proper diagnosis even though doctors have indicated that they believe I have it too. I’m currently in the process of getting it diagnosed but where I live in Sweden, it will take at least a year before I get my diagnosis. Going private, I would get it much faster, but I can’t afford that atm.

I discussed all these issues with my psychiatrist today and she seemed to indicate that I perhaps could add Wellbutrin to help with the tiredness, lack of concentration and motivation? She can’t prescribe “proper” ADD/ADHD medications like concerta, ritalin or elvanse before I get a proper diagnosis, and so this was the option given to me.

Has anyone combined Trintellix with Wellbutrin? Why are you on this combination of meds? What dosages are you on? Have they worked well for you? Any tips are appreciated!

Thanks for reading!",Trintellix and Wellbutrin?

ADHD,"Hi, I was looking into getting a diagnosis/evaluation, but due to COVID, most of the places I called are doing online scheduling, so I wanted to know how the process would look like if everything were to be online? I kind of made a list of my symptoms and such throughout my life, and recently as well— would this be appropriate to show my evaluator or just let the conversation flow?

In addition, I saw a lot of online forums that said there’s a possibility of your evaluator interviewing someone from your family about your behaviors. My family are immigrants so they don’t understand mental health the same way we do, and I know they might down play any questions during interviews. They say I don’t need a diagnoses, but I am going to go through with it anyways— I have the money and my parents basically let me control my insurance so they don’t mind.",How was your experience getting diagnosed with ADHD during COVID?
ADHD,"Hello everyone, I was diagnosed with ADHD today and was prescribed 18mg of concerta to begin tomorrow. I am really nervous in terms of how I'll react, I understand everyone's body reacts differently to medication. Im also worried about the idea of taking medication everyday for the rest of my life, has anyone been on ADHD medication before and slowly leaned off of it and felt okay?

I just started concerta on Friday 18mg. Since then I’ve felt slightly more productive but I’m not sure if it’s just placebo or not. 
I am going up to 36mg on Friday cause I don’t feel much and wondering did anyone notice a difference in this switch?

ADHD,"This is my first time ever posting, and I've cross-posted as it involves abuse, narcissistic parents, mental health and mental age. I've been a lurker for awhile and have found so many stories of people who have similar experiences and its encouraged me to share my own story now. trying to keep it as brief as possible, I was born in the mid80s, was a 90s kid, a teenager in the early 2000s. My entire life back to my earliest memories was filled with abuse and out of control rage. there's maybe 1 or 2 good memories sprinkled in my whole childhood/youth, and they dont involve my family. My dad was my main abuser. My mom stood by and did nothing and has gaslit me my entire life that none of it happened. Starting from my earliest memories I remember him hitting my mom across the face, chasing me through the house everyday hitting me...dinnertimes from my childhood have scarred me, i was expected to sit ""properly"": both feet planted flat on the ground, i always want to sit cross legged or sitting on one foot or one leg bent up and the other one bent underneath me, and no elbows on the table, had to ""hold my knife and fork properly"", i would get in trouble even for how i placed my knife and fork down on the plate, there's apparently a right way to set down your cutlery on the plate and apparently this was an extremely important thing i needed to learn in life (sarcasm). My dad wouldn't just snap at me for this, i had to sit beside him i wasnt allowed to sit away from him, he would kick me under the table, pinch my arm or elbow me if i did anything ""wrong"" at the dinner table. So i have this huge negative memory surrounding eating, contributing to my 22 years of eating disorder. so now as an adult I make it a point that eating time is a time to feel the most comfortable, relaxed, i make it an enjoyable almost spiritual experience now. I sit how i want, however my body feels comfortable, i dont give a shit about elbows or any dumb shit. when i have meals now i treasure the time and make it a nice happy positive experience. This is one of the ""minor"" abuses from my dad but had a huge negative impact on me. The majority of the abuse was him chasing me thru the house hitting me as I'm trying to run away from him. My mom witnessed almost all of the abuse. she would stand there in the doorway yelling ""john stop!"" but not actually doing anything or trying to stop him, she also never came to me after to see if i was ok or comfort me, no. All through my childhood i was blamed as being the most horrible child and i was deserving of the ""discipline"" as they called it. They told me straight up that its not abuse if it's with an open hand. Gotta love being a 90s kid. I feel like if I had been born in the next generation and had access to a smart phone i would have had the evidence to help myself get out of that situation, not to mention as time has progressed and sociey is realizing that hitting kids is wrong and its not discipline its abuse. I could've had voice and video recordings and hard proof , since no one believed i was being abused. i think he was very strategic in how hard he hit me so as not to leave bruises, but he left red marks all the time and bruises at some times, and always on areas of my body that could be covered by clothes. My dad is a rageaholic. not just him hitting me it was him raging as he's chasing me and hitting me. Tearing off my bedroom door for all of ages 13-14, ripping off all the pictures on my wall some of it my own artwork, he did this all the time and one night i snapped and went into a psychosis (13 at the time), my dad was in one of his rage moments destroying my bedroom so i got a big butcher knife and started walking up the stairs to my room...in that moment i wanted to go up and slit my wrists in front of him but i wasn't sure if i could stop myself there. Mom's screaming the whole time. He came down the stairs and grabbed the knife from me, cutting up his whole hand in the process (karma), we all go to the hospital and i vaguely remeber this cause it was so traumatic, but i spoke with a psychologist/psychiatrist at the hospital but i have zero recollection of that conversation, i remember sitting in the room and talking to someone but not what was said. but it resulted in us all being sent home, no counseling no child services got involved. Then at 15 one night i have to go meet him at his office &amp; i thought my sister was there too, i get there and its only him. he proceeds to grab me, throw me in to the elevator, hitting and pushing me around and yelling at me in the elevator ride threating to kill me, we get to his office and he's trying to rip my bag away from me (crossbody bag), he then starts choking me lifting my entire body up off the ground and holding me up by my neck against the wall. when we got back home i immediately said to my mom that he just choked me and i described in detail and she straught up called me a liar and i made it all up and how horrible i am to be making these horrible accusations against my father. oh and he was also covertly sexually abusing me too but i didn't even realize that it ""counted"" until i spoke with a therapist in my 20s, and she confirmed yes i was sexually abused as well by my dad. its so sickening i couldn't even think the thought even now just saying it is a first. But apparently all of the memories of my entire childhood are false, according to my mom. How can this be false when I remember these things all throughout my childhood? how is every single memory i have false? how is it false when i have been diagnosed depression since 16 which is now major depressive disorder, major anxiety and panic disorder, self harm and past suicide attempts, PTSD, night terrors and sleep paralysis, constant dissociating, waking flashbacks and flashbacks all day until i can finally achieve sleep, which i can only achieve with smoking green so now i have to rely on that to get me through the turmoil i feel inside. I believe im also undiagnosed ADHD and Asperger's or on the autism spectrum anyway, and so my parents abused and neglected a disabled kid. It was already so bad but finding these things out about myself being adhd and autistic made it feel even worse like, i was so mistreated and abused, i should have had help and supports for my conditions and their abuse made it 1000 times worse. Im 34 now and feel mentally like i never grew past a teenager age, thats how i feel inside. I have my own 14 year old daughter and i feel like we are on the same level in fact she is alot more mature and aware of the world and life than i was at that age, but that's a whole other post.
I just recently, stupidly, reconnnected with my mom, it was a huge huge huge mistake. she retriggered so much and i ended up self harming for the first time in almost 4 years, the worst I've ever cut myself i needed 13 stitches and glue and tape. in our brief re-encounter, I expressed how i feel I'm undiagnosed adhd and autism and she agreed (shockingly), and we discussed how much wasnt known back then especially for girls, i was being very diplomatic and not blaming her even though it is her fault that she didn't take me to a doctor or psychologist, but i was never allowed to go to counseling because (unspoken but i know this is why) my dad wouldn't allow anyone to expose him. As an adult going to counseling and one counselor having a background in social work, ive been told by multiple people in these positions that i would have been taken from the home and put into fostercare. but my mom still believes i wasn't abused. Theres a whole bunch of factors at play as well, like religion, conservatie bigoted politics... trying not to write an entire novel. on top of all that i have 2 older sisters (im the youngest) who never protected me and were both brainwashed by my dad growing up that i was a bad kid who deserved it, so they bullied on me too and made my life hell. so i have no sisters and no family. I spend my whole life feeling like im worth nothing because of how my suppoaed ""family"" has always treated me like im trash they cant get rid of. I think there's a special place in hell for mothers who choose not to protect their children and destroy their child's mental health.",Undiagnosed ADHD and trauma stunted my emotional development.
ADHD,"I'll start this off by saying I have ADHD, been diagnosed since Grade 2 back in '00/'01. I am now 27. The beginning of this isn't particularly ADHD related, but it becomes relevant halfway down as it's treatment may be what leads to my death. It's long, but I appreciate anyone's assistance. I added a TL;DR paragraph to sum up the story for you, and 

**-Marfanoid habitus-**

I recently found out that I am technically considered a [Marfanoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marfanoid). I fit every description, but have not been diagnosed with any of the disorders that cause it. My arm span to body height ratio is 1.09. (Arm Span: 6'4"", Height: 5'10"") My teeth are fucked and overcrowded, my fingers AND TOES are abnormally long (fingers not so much, only noticeable compared to other family members fat short fingers, but toes are pretty apparent compared to everyone).  All of these are some of the apparent physical signs of [Marfan Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marfan_syndrome).  Other than ""Sometimes it do be like that,"" this is probably the best and most realistic cause, all other disorders are pretty severe and would have been picked up in my youth. The only thing is, Marfan Syndrome requires a mix of medical tests to obtain a diagnosis: DNA gene mutation presence, and/or echocardiograms, and/or Skeletal Xrays, and/or other random flexibility tests to diagnose. The process is underway to get these tests, but these will take time.

It also means that if I have Marfan Syndrome, I more than likely have a fucked up valve in my heart, and possibly a widened Aorta (among other muscular, skeletal, and musculoskeletal problems that may arise with this connective tissue affecting genetic disorder). This only serves to worsen with age, and can lead to possible fatal complications such as heart failure and aortic aneurysm.

That being said, I am the first in my entire family to have this disorder (unless my mom cheated and my real bio dad has it) which means this was a 1 in 20,000 chance of happening according to current research/studies (Affects 1 in 5,000 people, 3/4 of them have a parent that also had it.) It really does not matter HOW I got it, what matters the most to me is that these studies also show that a parent with Marfan Syndrome has a 50% chance to pass it to their offspring. So because I have it, my daughters chances of having it are 1 in 2. She has my abnormally long toes. (You know abnormally long toes when you see them. Multiple toes are longer than or equal in length to the big toe.)

**-ADHD-**

All this information, couple with my long-term and continued stimulant use for my ADHD diagnosis I received in Grade 2, I do not expect to live long with the heart I was born with. One day I may just not wake up, or collapse dead on the floor due to a burst aortic aneurysm. This is ok with me. I have grown fine with the idea of dying, and have always been open minded about it. Other people are not as cool with me dying, as I am with me dying. What worries me the most now is leaving my young daughter behind and her going her entire life without being understood like me. 

I know my ex, I know her family, I know my parents. They all knew relatively early on in their corresponding relationships with me that I had ADHD. None of them did any research on it to this day and are still shocked every time they see me do things, or more specifically NOT doing things that I should be doing. Most of these occurrences can be adequately explained by an area of Executive Functioning being affected. 

I went my whole life believing I was a screw up for struggling to keep up with my peers, only for me to realize in adulthood they were trying to teach a fish to climb a mountain. I had the classic constant feeling of being a failure, pretty characteristic of the undiagnosed ADHD experience, while also being on a stimulant that I, as a child, thought was essentially a vitamin. Every time I'd act up, I'd hear ""did you take your pill?"" from any one of my direct family members, sister included (two years younger than me, literally did not know any better, feels bad about it today). Developed 0 coping mechanisms for ADHD, only an unhealthy reliance on my pills and parents. I had no idea what stimulants did or that they each have side affects because my parents refused to believe I was different throughout my entire childhood and into my teens. To them, the more quiet I was the better.

**-Inheritence-**

I don't think any of them seriously consider that there is a 40-50% chance that my daughter has ADHD simply because I have it. Let alone all the environmental factors in her upbringing, and known family history of psychiatric illness in my ex's family (Schizophrenia (her dad's side only), drug abuse and ADHD-like symptoms across the board for all half-relatives of ex), as well as my family history (Bipolar (me, cousin), ADHD (cousin)). They also have no clue that ADHD symptoms generally appear different in females from the stereotypical ""hyper-boy"" disorder that the mainstream media portrays, and most ADHD females go undiagnosed because of this, only seeking help once they find out that information is false.

They adamantly deny, shut down and belittle my opinion when I tell them she experiences clear signs of ADHD in all group lessons she is in. Skating, swimming, gymnastics, etc. She walks (or swims) away from her group mid-lesson, and does her own thing. Not paying attention to the actual lesson, and eventually ""failing"" and having to retake the course (Except gymnastics, those are age based levels, not at all skill based unless you're going competitive). 

They pass it off as ""Oh she's just like every other kid."" which is clearly untrue since she's the only one breaking away from the group, and other kids are passing the course. The worst I've heard is ""Oh she's just like you."" to which I replied ""No shit, that's the problem. I have ADHD."" If the lesson is 1 on 1, she has no issue and excels because she's not as afraid to ask questions, and she's under constant supervision and being held accountable by that.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR** 

I'm in a catch 22. I may have been born with Marfan Syndrome, which can easily have been passed to my child, and affects the heart/aorta structure. I also definitely was born with or developed ADHD early in my youth due to a mix of genetics and environmental factors. The main and most effective treatment for ADHD is typically stimulants. Stimulants are shown to cause heart damage over time. I have been taking stimulants or another since Grade 2 (20 years on stimulants total, 10 of them I was taking Adderall XR 30mg). In order for me to function at socially tolerable level, I require a stimulant. Non-stimulant treatment has shown to be not effective for me. I also don't want to die of heart failure and would like to see my daughter live to adulthood at least.

Facts are the only thing keeping me functioning in society, may be the thing that kills me at a young age, and I may have inadvertently doomed my daughter to repeat it based on my shitty genetics.

I know this isn't particularly ADHD related and may be best suited for another forum, but I always found the ADHD community to be much more open minded, with the most range in helpful advice. Most others just turn into a toxic echo chamber.

ADHD,"I have a new doctor and am feeling conflicted. Looking for advice / insight.

Brief background:  I am 26. Growing up, my parents suspected I had ADHD (I definitely had anxiety too but it manifested in small infrequent ways and didn’t get much worse until I got older.) As with many women, I was so “accomplished” academically and with extracurriculars that I went undiagnosed until I was 19, a year after I barely graduated high school.

My psychiatrist prescribed me strattera and a low dose of adderall (the adderall came after I had an allergic reaction to a different stimulant.) I finally had some self control in terms of my hyperactivity, I stopped shouting out as much in school and my confidence improved greatly because I was doing well in college. 

I stopped taking adderall my senior year... because I became really depressed for a number of reasons and just didn’t feel like taking my meds or doing work. Or anything really. My doctor actually called my parents because she was concerned that I hadn’t come to get my monthly prescriptions for the  rest of my school years. 


Anyway, I moved across the country this past year and have a meeting psychiatrist. I really like him and he doesn’t take insurance, but I am paying out of pocket because it’s worth it to invest in myself and have a great doctor.

He saw that I was allergic to the first stimulant medication I was prescribed and asked about my allergic reaction (which was actually kinda gnarly lol I got excused from one of my first exams for it to take later!)  and then asked me about the strattera. 

He asked if it helped. I said “I think so.” He asked if my grades went up. I replied that they did. But I didn’t mention that I had also been prescribed adderall as a supplement to my strattera. Honestly, I would not have made it through college without the combo of those two meds. But I felt guilty for that / would have felt guilty for telling him that, despite the fact that I was prescribed these meds because I needed them, so I didn’t tell him.

I’m not really sure what to do now...my anxiety has gotten pretty bad with the state of the world (pandemic) and being stuck in the house, so he is treating that first which is definitely my priority as well. But with my new job, I feel as though I may need to fess up and be open minded to the possibility of trying a stimulant medication again. I feel stupid for it and .... yeah idk. I kind of feel this way about my antidepressants even. I just wish I could do things the way I do them with my meds, without my meds.

From the outside the meds don’t seem to help with his work, his mood, or any obvious elements of his adhd. However, I have no idea what it is like to actually have adhd and therefore cannot understand his point of view. I have tried asking but he only said it helps him with his card games and got upset when I looked at him expectantly for more (I wasn’t trying to upset him I just have a really expressive face that gives away every thought). Knowing he can focus on his cards is obviously amazing and I feel so selfish admitting it, but I am struggling with the fact that 5/7 days a week we aren’t able to be close or happy with each other. This is especially hard during the pandemic as we are around each other a lot. I was wondering if anyone who has had a positive experience with medication could try explaining why it was so positive? I was also wondering if I could improve the way I act on the days that he is on his meds? He says he doesn’t mind me being around him, but he cringes, pulls away, leaves the room constantly and looks exasperated whenever I talk - if it would help him to be left alone I would rather give him the space he needs, but I also feel weird ignoring what he says to my face as he has always been honest.

ADHD,"(CW: brief mention of being sick—mostly for the emetophobic)

I have this issue of what I call the “breakfast cycle of doom” in which I wake up, take my meds (including Vyvance 30mg), and stare longingly at the kitchen until I have to leave for the day. I know that I’m hungry and that if I don’t eat, I’ll be miserable until lunch (if I even eat that); but everything in the morning sounds absolutely disgusting to me and I can’t fathom eating any of what I have in the house. The mere thought of eggs, toast, cereal, and various pastries make me sick, quite honestly. So I usually end up going through my day hungry and pissy about it until I wake up the next morning to repeat the process.

Why am I like this lol",Inside my ADHD mind
ADHD,"I'm relatively new to ADHD diagnosis and meds. Started with methylphenidate IR and didn't really like it, as the ratio of jittery side effects to focus benefits was too high. Tried adderall IR next, and it has been a much better fit. For whatever reason I don't feel as jittery and anxious as with the methylphenidate. 

I assumed that I would want to progress to the XR version once I settled on the right med, since I need coverage for my entire workdays. But I have started taking 4 divided doses of IR every couple hours, vs the two dose schedule recommended, and it has been working really well. I don't have the ups and downs during the day, it's more of a long peak before I drop off in the late afternoon as the workday is ending. 

So I had a thought that being on IR actually gives me the flexibility to have all day coverage, but also to start later or end earlier if I want to. Some days, especially weekends, I like to take a little break. But sometimes I just want to have a normal morning and then maybe be functional for home duties and obligations for the second half of the day. Or vice versa: get shit done in the morning and then be able to take a nap in the afternoon. I am definitely not one of those people that can nap on adderall. But If I only had XR in the late day scenario, I might be screwed because I definitely have trouble sleeping if I take IR after about 3pm. So if I took XR at 12pm I can imagine I would have trouble sleeping that night.

I don't really have a problem taking divided doses 4x a day to get more of the XR type coverage, but I do wonder if I'm missing something and that the XR might feel better or do better for me in some way. Anybody else have experience with this?","Adderall IR vs XR, need all day coverage most of the time, but want some flexibility"

I love her wholly, but this person doesn’t feel like the person I got into a relationship with. I want to work on how I can be better prepared to help her in this situation, and if it’d be fair to tell her how her not taking her medication makes me feel (I know she doesn’t mind taking it, so I don’t know why she doesn’t sometimes). I just worry because the person she becomes when she skips a day makes me feel insecure and th relationship becomes emotionally volatile, but I’m committed to making it work.","My girlfriend (18F) doesn’t take her ADHD medication, and it’s hard for me (19M) to feel the same around her"

I'm 19 years old, diagnosed last year and couldn't get meds because stimulant meds aren't allowed in my country, I moved to France and had to go through the whole process of diagnosis again, and I finally I got my meds last week, I felt a big difference, especially when playing football, and when studying, like when I study I can sit throught and study, my friends noticed the difference too. But throughout the week I started to think maybe the meds aren't working and this is just a placebo effect, but today, after getting home and after the effect of meds wore off, I tried studying for the first time off meds, and te difference was clear, I was jumping from tab to tab, moving the mouse around, not able to listen through without getting distracted, got up a few times, and felt bored.

ADHD,"Hello ADHD Redditors!

I got accepted into law school (YAY!) and will be starting in fall of 2021. I am super smart and have no doubt that I am intellectually up for the challenge, BUT attention problems unfortunately make reading long dense bodies of text a struggle and a half (I'm sure y'all relate).

I thought my current undergraduate degree had a lot of reading (\~60 pages per class per week) but when reading reddit posts from people currently attending my future law school, they claim that the amount of reading can get as high as \~200 pages per class per week!

Needless to say I'm kind of freaking out. It was already very tough getting my readings completed on time with 60 pages per class but 200??? My stomach is doing somersaults just thinking about it. I know lots of people are successful at law school with ADHD so evidently, it is possible to manage. If you have any tips or suggestions for how you keep/kept on top of all your readings with ADHD, it would be greatly appreciated. (No medication suggestions please).

P.S. General tips about how to read faster/more efficiently are also welcome.

I take it almost every day, (I need it every day, I just try to make it last because I get a dose lower than I need, wares off fast, doesn't work that well) and it works well enough that I can do pretty well academically. However. Socially/mentally I'm a MESS. I haven't felt this specific type of depression type apathy before from vyvanse (and I've also had generalized anxiety/depression before). I have no idea if this is a result of doing work 24/7 and just being mentally vacant, or if the meds off and on (and adderall itself) are really messing with my brain chemistry. I feel so off it's insane, and I really don't think it's an anxiety/depression relapse because I've worked through a lot of the trauma that caused those feelings. I'm almost like agoraphobic, I'm really awkward around people to the point where I avoid everyone and every little interaction, and I feel like I'm legit in space when I have conversations, go outside, do anything. It's like I'm tripping all the time and nothing can make me feel an emotion at ALL, like anything at all, except maybe chuckle at a joke or get really sad for a short time period. I have no desire for anything at all, even my vices. It's really freaking me out, and I feel myself falling into a mental hole right now that no one is really aware of because I'm also simultaneously creating a fortified bubble around myself so that no one can ""know"".

ADHD,"I was diagnosed with ADHD just before I turned 30, I somehow squeaked through undergrad, and I'm struggling to finish grad school now, along with a certificate program. I went from Adderall, to Ritalin, and now Intuniv (guanfacine) the last few months and am struggling with side effects, and lack of motivation again. 

The Adderall and Ritalin increased my blood pressure drastically, along with other issues men face, the guanfacine is less than a week old for me, and I've noticed it makes me very tired and sleepy.

I have been struggling with executive function related tasks, and getting things done while on this new medication. I mustered up the strength to finally get my haircut yesterday after not getting a haircut for 2 months, I'm struggling to get back in my gym routine, and now I'm currently laying in bed trying to get my days work done. It hasn't happened yet, and it's already 3:46 p.m.

 Any advice or recommendations?

 I did function better on Adderall But the side effects included an increased heart rate, my resting heart rate was hovering around 129 beats per minute many days. I actually had to go to the ER back in November because of how much my blood pressure increased while battling a respiratory infection. Ritalin was no better, it was the same issues with blood pressure, but I didn't get that push to get work completed while on it. Which is why my doctor switched me to the current medication.

ADHD,"A few times I have asked for advice on things on Reddit and other forums (on throwaway accounts) and several times people have replied saying they relate and they have inattentive ADHD. I can't tell if it's happening a lot because I feel like ADHD has received a lot of attention recently and is more in the public consciousness  (e.g. on TikTok, Twitter, etc) or whether it suggests I may have inattentive ADHD.

The reason why I don't believe I have ADHD is because I don't match any of the typical symptoms/characteristics. I am good with attention to detail, well-organised, not forgetful, can concentrate for long periods of time on tedious tasks, never lose things, etc. However, I'm not sure whether I'm masking it by over-compensating.

However, based on what I have been witnessing since my own diagnosis (Oct 2019) has me pretty sure she has ADHD, which is probably contributing to the other ailments.  The tipping point for me was when I recently visited her and found jars/containers/bags containing the same random impulse purchases that are present in my own house, scattered about her dresser, bathroom, one side of the bed, window sill, etc..   When I asked her what she was buying all of this stuff for, she pulled a crumbled up post-it note out of a separate shopping bag with scribbles on it to answer my question, and knocked a few things over in the process.  And OMG, the water bottles!! The sprinkling of socks and papers all over the floor!  It looked like my bedroom that always got me in trouble when I was growing up.

ADHD,"I always get shit for my overly-messy room. 

I’ve got piles of laundry both dirty and clean, so many dishes it’s kinda obscene, and on top of it all is a fine layer of dust. I admit, it’s gross. 

But at the same time I hate when people are in there, when they mess with my stuff, or try to clean it. I have everything in its place, which I call “organized chaos”. Now, if the rest of the house was so messy I’d have a melt down, but just the one room, my personal mess space, can be as horrid as I want and it doesn’t bother me. 

I’ve always got crap for that, but what bothers me is people (mostly family) pointing out my other behaviors that contrast so much with it. They tell me it makes no sense for me to act so different in similar subjects. 

For example, I can’t get water if the trash can has been opened within the last hour. Even if I’m *really* dehydrated, unless I get one of those plastic prepackaged water bottles, I won’t touch the water descender. I have gone days with no liquid because of this. As annoying as it is, if I break this routine it bugs the crap out of me and it’s all I ever think about for at least a week. Also,
When I put on shoes I have to wash my hands right away. Another example is that If my morning doesn’t go *exactly* as planned (just the first hour after I wake up, not that long) then I can’t do work that day because I focus on that moment so hard. Other then that I get too spaced out and can’t give my all, or I’ll just flat out forget about a deadline or important project. 

It’s all just so frustrating. All these weird things are controlling how I live. I was told yesterday, “Don’t let that one thing decide your day” and while they were trying to be helpful and reassuring, it frustrated me.

I wanted to share some of the ones I use a lot and hopefully hear some new ones from other ADHD brains!!

The ones I like using are:

---

**For Brain Fog**

It's like you're driving in the slow lane and you *want* to switch lanes, but all the oncoming cars are going too fast. 

Also you're trying to drive from the passengers seat, so you don't have much control of the wheel. 

Also the car radio is playing the *same damn song on repeat* (like, its always doing that, but its even louder rn for no reason). 

---

**For Time Blindness**

Yknow how some days feel like they went by faster or slower than others, and when you wake up each morning you have no way of knowing if its gonna be a fast or slow day beforehand? 

Now imagine instead of every *day* going unpredictably faster/slower, its every *15 minutes.* 

The last 15 minutes might've been faster or slower than the previous 15 minutes. And there's no way to predict the speed of the next 15 minutes. And sometimes it's not even 15 minutes! It could be every 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 4.25 minutes, theres no telling!!

---

**For Fidgeting**

I have lightning that's trapped in my body and it just HAS to be used in some way. It can't just sit there or I will die. 

(For Avatar the Last Airbender fans, explain that its like lightning bending! But bending = fidgeting) 

---

**For Procrastination** (this one's kinda long but it helped me explain it to an ADHD skeptic professor, so I'm very proud of it!!) 

Imagine you're in a hospital waiting room and you're waiting for your name to be called. You broke your back really badly to the point where it hurts to stand, so you sit down. 

Now imagine something happens where you need to stand up and leave, like a fire or something. But it hurts *so* badly to stand up that you just can't do it. 

Some people come to scream at you for staying seated, and you try to explain your problem, but they say 'that's no excuse, there's a fire burning down the building!' 

Finally when the flames touch your hand, you get yourself to stand up and you quickly try to make up for lost time by hobbling to the exit.

(Add on: Accountability helps a lot because it's like someone handing you a crutch or offering to help you escape instead of just screaming at you to get up)

ADHD,"Its like when you are craving a specific food, but dont know what it is,and its 100 times worse. Kind of like all of my thoughts are scrambled and incomplete,im thinking too fast ,and im hyperfocusing on everything in existence and nothing. Im bored of everything and want to do everything, and i want to do nothing as well. It happens like every four months and it always takes a few minutes to a few hours to fix, and its never the same way to fix. Its like boredom so bad that its almost suffocating,its like im  understimulated and over stimulated at the sametime. But i dont wanna see a docter for this symptom becuase it cuases me to be super productive becuase i feel an intense need to be productive while its happening, but also having half an anxiety attack at the same time. The best way to describe it is like the most sane and productive form of insanity, and normally it lasts long enough to get stuff done before i find the specific thing that stops it. Normally its organizing something or building something, but its always different and specific. The easiest way to fix it was always organizing my video games and video game consoles becuase i had so many of both and i enjoyed them. It usually took about 2 hours of organizing them before it was perfect and the feeling went away. But i cant do any of the things that have fixed it in the past. I only have one console right now, no game cases to organize, no building supplies, and ive already tried all the other ways of getting ridd of it and none worked. Its a very uncomfortable feeling and its actually incredibly fun when i find the ""itch"" of what i needed to do for it to go away. Its sounds like ocd when i put it into words but its nothing like ocd, its like all my emotions and adhd symptoms are happening at once even if they conflict ending with uncomfortable  boredom.  I couldnt fully explain it, not even close,but there has to be at least one person who has experienced this and can help. I want help from someone who understands it fully and has experienced it. I sound crazy i know but it needs to be someone who can actually understand what im trying to say becuase without experiencing this it just sounds completely different from the actuall experience becuase the explanation doesnt make any sense otherwise, and actually sounds different from the actuall experience when described but thats the best way to describe it to someone whos experienced it.

I’m gonna go to my doctor soon and ask about raising my prescription to 20mg (i’m on 10 rn), but I’m worried that none of these medications will help.

ADHD,"Hi all,

I’ve spent a lifetime of work starting at 9am and never arriving at 9am. I always get there by 9.15am latest but usually it’s 9.05-9.10. I’m a social worker and don’t have appointments at this time. It’s never been an issue in other roles. I usually hyperfocus through lunch and don’t join the social work lunch (preferring to work and take a 10 min walk alone). I am always the last one in the office at the end of the day and the outcomes my clients have from my work with them are exceeding the work of most if not all of my colleagues. There’s no doubt I work my bum off once in the office, but my manager is being overzealous about this 15 min window that I really need as grace in the mornings.

ADHD,"Hello, Fellow Brains. (yes I stole that, you know from where). I'm sure many of you have similar experience with incredibly irresponsible life decisions made out of passion &amp; that panicked drive for change we can find ourselves in. Everything in my life has happened nearly out of chance, and due to years of denial of having ADHD, while financially reasonably successful (mainly due to unfettered greed), I find myself woefully uneducated and in a unique position. 

About 6 months ago, I left one of the many passing jobs that I'd stay at long enough to excel at, but learn to hate. I started my own business, taking an immense and irresponsible financial risk. For the last two months, that risk has paid dividends on the initial investment tenfold. Maybe I'm succeeding. The clients keep coming, as does the money. I just can't get myself to believe it, and I'm working 10-12 hour days, 7 days a week. I sleep well, lead a healthy lifestyle. I can't stop myself though. I feel like this endeavor is a fragile baby, and time off will result in it's horryfing death. I can tell I'm slipping a bit, and the isolation has left me lonely for the first time in a while. 

SO. What's the point of this post? To complain about my generally great life? Well, I suppose so. I'm looking for tips/advice from those of you who can relate to the fragility of new success, especially how you cope with an incredible fear of failure, and how you kept your mental health in check.

ADHD,"Hello everyone... I've posted here a few times in the past about my struggles.

Last week I had a consultation with a therapist who has ADHD herself, and helps a lot of people with ADHD... I told her about all of my struggles, about how I was growing up, in college, and now. She basically validated my suspicion that I might have ADHD. She said she obviously can't diagnose me herself, but said that when I was describing my struggles it sounded like I was describing her life. She basically said it sounds like I have ADHD without flat out telling me. I really felt heard and understood. She didn't doubt my experiences or make me feel bad.

So I have a psychiatrist appointment in a few days and it's all I can think about. I feel incapable of thinking about anything else at this point. I mean, it's hard to focus on regular days but this has just been consuming me. I want answers so badly. I'm so scared the psychiatrist won't take my seriously. I've never been to one before and I have NO idea what to expect. I've already filled out everything online, including an ADHD questionnaire.

Should I explicitly say I'm there because I think I have ADHD? My worry with this is I don't want them to think I'm there for the medication. I've always been super hesitant about medication in general, even though I know its helpful for a lot of people. I just want to understand myself you know? I've read some peoples experiences that you should just describe your experiences and symptoms instead of telling them you think you have something. What do you guys think?

ADHD,"So, I was prescribed Adderall about 2 months ago and, while it definitely is helping, I barely notice a difference now that I have been on it for awhile. Probably the most prominent effect it has had is that I no longer forget to do things like I used to. Sure, I still mess up now and again but it is no where near as bad as it used to be. I have better concentration too but only some days. Some days, I can sit down and read an entire book in one sitting while others I struggle to find the motivation to even open to the page I left off on (I particularly struggle with this in a literature class I am taking). I also still fidget quite a bit (not as much as I used to but it is still a struggle). In order to pay attention (such as in class), I have to be doing something else (such as playing a mobile game, doodling/drawing, picking at my skin, playing with my hair) in order to absorb anything. It’s really annoying because I’m constantly worried about getting in trouble for doing activities other than what I’m expected to be doing in class that allow me to focus. As I was recently diagnosed, my teachers are unaware that I struggle with ADHD and have to do stim to pay attention. 

What I am wondering is if I am struggling just because I’m having days where my symptoms are worse than others? Or do I need a higher dose? I currently take 20 mg once a day in the morning but by the time I begin my work day (around 3 pm) I can tell that it is no longer in my system. I just have no motivation or energy to do anything because my mind is constantly everywhere else. I’m thinking of asking about starting to take it twice a day. 

Does anyone who has been through this process happen have any advice?",Am I on too low of a dose?
ADHD,"I have a phenomenon that I have affectionately termed my ""ADHD ghost"". Please allow me to introduce him and tell me what tricks yours plays on you.

This is an all too common example:

I will be in the kitchen, making the same damn supper I make every night, going through the same steps. Then I will look down and something is missing. Just vanished from the spot I left it in. Like my paring knife. 

Now, I know from experience, that I must have been day dreaming while chopping and went on auto-pilot but have zero recollection or usually even knowledge of what I was day dreaming about. I am only snapped out of my (hopefully) meaningful head dialogue when my routine is interrupted because I cannot continue without the missing item. 9 times out of 10, I put it away in the knife drawer or in my sink to wash--even though I'm not yet done with it. This is where I usually find it, but occasionally I must go into what another has endearingly termed a ""deep dive"". I so related to their experience, I needed to share my own.

Now, the deep dives, they suck. I feel like you KNOW what a deep dive entails although the term may be foreign. There is probably even a sense of dread washing over you now as you read this in empathy. 

I suggest you have multiple back ups of important items for instances when time does not permit a deep dive. Deep dives have no time frame, time does not seem to exist when the ADHD ghost hides something so well you need to tear your house apart. 

The time, space continuum just folds in upon itself at the sheer horror that an intelligent, adult human being could put a paring knife in her own sock drawer... at the very back, no less. Because OBVIOUSLY, one day, my pairing knife will prove handy at the back of my sock drawer, right? FUCK NO. In no parallel universe is this EVER right or wise! Why ADHD Ghost, just WHY?! But I digress... If a deep dive must be undertaken, it could take 30 seconds or 3 years, 2 months and 6 days to find the MIA item. 

You should NEVER look in the most logical place for vanishing items if you suspect your ADHD ghost has gone rogue. You should look in weird places, like inside your pickle jar, being used as a bookmark or, even buried in your potted plant. Cuz, who knows? ADHD ghost is a trickster. When you have ADHD, you cant trust your own memory and logic after all.

Ive shared all about my little ADHD ghoul with neurotypicals, wondering if this could be a shared, normal human experience. They look at me with shock, awe and concern that I may have brain damage. Many recall putting something like milk away when they are not yet done with it. But they vaguely RECALL it. Know they did it, just not sure why, as they were deep in thought. They also put it in a reasonable place, like the fridge. Me? Space cadetting so hard, I have no awareness of even having moved from the spot. I just look down, and the ADHD ghost stole my shit. Again.

Edit: this ghost is also an expert at making me late. I am usually running right on schedule when I realize my ADHD apparition has levitated my car keys into another dimension. If it requires a deep dive to locate them? You better believe I'm just calling in sick. Preferable to explaining to my employer that my ADHD Ghost lifted my car keys and they could take eons to locate and an experienced search and rescue team of deep divers.",Please lett me introduce my ADHD ghost
ADHD,"I’m getting my PhD right now. This page has been so helpful already to know there are many people out there like me. But I’m still at such a loss about being able to function and get work done daily. 

My main questions for everyone are: 

How do people stick to a working/writing schedule every day? Especially now that many people work from home. 

Do your advisors (or boss) know you have ADHD? Will it help me if I’m transparent about my struggles? My advisors know I’ve been struggling with depression, but don’t know about my recent ADHD diagnosis. 

I’m working on my dissertation and currently on fellowship, which basically means I have no set work schedule and no where to be, ever. Especially since COVID. I was just diagnosed with ADHD less than a month ago, and now I understand more about myself. Having no schedule and no accountability structure beyond my advisors is just a recipe for unending procrastination and anxiety. I’ve tried writing groups, and it helps for about a week until I get so burnt out and sleep in a bunch, missing regular working hours. I signed up for a writing accountability online forum, and it worked for a few weeks. But when I tried the program again, it just deepened my anxiety and I avoided everything instead. Beyond trying to make accountability structures for myself stick, I’m also working hard in therapy to help with anxiety and impostor syndrome (have been for years now). I have a good psychiatrist who has thankfully spotted that I don’t just have depression and an anxiety disorder. So she has put me on antidepressants that have definitely helped because I went from not getting out of bed ever to being able to do the bare minimum most days of the week. She just had me figure out if Adderall or Ritalin is the way to go for me, so I’ve been trying to decide which works better. I think the Adderall helps more but I wonder if I need to up my prescription? Right now I’m on 20mg— is this a standard dose? 

My motivation levels vary depending on the day—some days I’m lucky I get out of bed. I try so hard to work but I feel like every time I start I get overwhelmed my the sheer amount I have to do, freak out, then calm down, then I’m exhausted and my brain is tired so I give up for the day. On a good day, I work for anywhere between one and three hours. On a bad day, I’m doing something to distract from the intense anxiety I feel about procrastinating (usually video games). This week has been particularly bad because my greatest accomplishment is that I made an actual human dinner for once. 

I feel so stuck. And I’m terrified I will never finish. I have a mandatory check in with my program and advisors— I have to show them what I’ve been working on by the end of the month. Only, I have almost nothing written to show them. I have some of the “thinking work” for part of my argument done but beyond that, no new pages to pass along. Do I be open about my ADHD with my advisors or is this something that they just don’t need to know?

Any tips or advice is so appreciated!",Academia and ADHD
ADHD,"I've always been unorganized with an awful schedule. (Of course... im on the adhd subreddit lol). But normal daily responsibilities such as getting up for work helped shape a somewhat normal day for me. During covid shutdown I don't have any reason to do anything at any given time (my work has been divided into 'shifts' and I have no set schedule)

I loved it so much at first. But I literally don't do shit all day. I cant get myself to do anything except stupid things that don't matter AT ALL. I feel like it's starting to catch up to me.

ADHD,"I was recently diagnosed with ADHD, and my doctor put me on 20mg of Vyvanse to start.

The first day was great—euphoria, as well as being able to focus on things like never before. The next few days were less amazing, as is to be expected, but while the meds were active they really helped with my productivity and focus. 

Problem is, they only seem to last for about 5 hours before I crash HARD. I’ve been getting extremely fatigued and sad, and tonight I’ve been more depressed than I’ve felt in a long time—I just spent the past hour crying my eyes out for no reason.

I take the vyvanse with food in the morning, eat three meals a day, avoid caffeine and take magnesium and b12 daily. 

I guess I’m just wondering if this is normal when starting a new medication? Will this go away/change down the line? I’m a grad student in the middle of a super busy semester, so only 5 hours of great focus really doesn’t seem worth this crash &amp; depression.

I read somewhere that ADHD meds can increase the amount of antidepressants that get into your blood ... so I’m worried that anytime I take new ADHD meds or increase my ADHD medication, I am essentially increasing the dose of my antidepressant too, which would explain the side effects.

ADHD,"I'm nervous for a lot of reasons, but here's what's happened:

I'm not diagnosed ADHD but I strongly suspect it's there. My brother and mother are diagnosed. I'm 28 and have struggled with depression and fatigue my whole life. For the past year, I've gotten the depression under control to the best degree I ever have. It's great. 

Still, I am effectively useless when I need to focus on something. The weird thing is I'm not even able to force myself to stay focused on things I *want* to do, and I keep myself busy by doing all the little side tasks and browsing the internet instead of tackling my actual important tasks. It's to a degree where I don't feel like I'm at the wheel. 

So, I had my first psych meeting yesterday. 

She asks if I've ever been treated for mental illness before and I tell her about my depression and years of therapy. 

She kind of latches on to that and says I probably have some underlying depression that needs to be managed better. In the end she prescribes Wellbutrin. 

Now, she may be right. But the thing is, I feel better now, when it comes to depression, than I have in 10+ years. I basically feel like I'm out of the woods (even though it still comes and goes and will likely be with me to some degree my whole life). It just kind of feelings like...odd timing? Here I am doing better than ever, and *now* I'm going to start a serious medication for depression that sometimes has horrific side effects? I feel like my current issue is clearly focus, not depression.

I dono. Maybe it will be great and I just need to try it. I guess I'm worried about the risk/reward of tinkering with my brain at this point. Even though I feel better than ever, I could definitely improve a lot, so maybe it's worth it.

I just wanted to say thank you to this group; I’m a 28 year old ICU doctor and never thought about the possibility of ADHD in myself before; until earlier this year I read about another female doctor in her late 20s who had been diagnosed with ADHD and it was such an emotional moment. All the problems she described could of been taken from my own life. And then I came to this subreddit and read a lot of your posts while sitting on my floor crying my eyes out. Maybe I wasn’t just useless and lazy. Maybe there were other people who had the same problems as me. Maybe there was something I could do about it!

ADHD,"I'm 32. Back in school, hopefully and finally finding something I wish I knew about 10 years ago. However, that's not the point of this post. The point is something that happened a week ago:

Like I stated, I'm back in school. Now, before I begin, I can probably state I could probably get through life without taking any medication. Would it be a challenge, sure; however, my Attention Deficit Disorder is not too server were I need medication on a daily basis but there are days it would be helpful while others I could go without.

Up until last week I haven't taken medication in about a year-and-a-half to two years. I'm consistently, inconsistent in not taking medication. Therefore, I was out and needed a refil. I work at hospital, and my hospital has a wellness.  If you don't know what a wellness center, its basis a clinic for employees, but with some restrictions, i.e. they can't prescribed Adderall.

I've used Adderall my entire diagnosis. For the last 12 years - theoretical I've had ADD my entire childhood but was never ""officially"" diagnosis, that's a different post for a different time. A different padora's box.

At this wellness center, in order for them to prescribe Adderall they need conformation from Psychiatrist once a year that they've prescribed Adderall to me. A little annoying but since I work in the health care field, I understand their reasoning. However, I've not seen my last Psychiatrist - been through 2 since I've started working at this hospital and using the wellness center in the last 5 years - since 2019.

I could go find a Primary Care Physician. I did, because that's alot easier. They can just prescribed it. However, that guy was asshole. Just did not care about me - another ran, another time. So, fuck him. He's not getting my insurance money. So, back to the wellness center.

Now - this is last Monday, the point of this post - I'm talking to the MA (Medcal Assistant) [she's basically wannabe Nurse. A step between Nurses Assistant and Nurse. Not alot places uses them] I'm telling her how I haven't taken medication in some time, being consistently, inconsistent, and basically needing it for schooling. I read one page, look at for 30 minutes and can't return for the rest of the week. I tell her I understand y'all can't prescribed Adderall at this time and I'm open to try something else until I can make an appointment - which I haven't yet - with my Psychiatrist.

After explaining this entire post to her, first thing she says: ***""So, why do you need medication?""***

After talking in circles for about 20 minutes, i was finally able to talk to the Nurse Practitioner (which is part of reasoning they can't prescribe Adderall directly) and she completely understood what was going on, understood my life and was more than willing to figure this out until I was able make an appointment with my Psychiatris.

I've been told by my psychiatrist that is it unlikely that my local NHS service will fund both medication and counselling so I have been researching private services. Really struggling to figure out what to look for in a counsellor, many say they are qualified to work with ADHD but I find it unlikely they all mean counselling directly **for** the behavioural effects of ADHD, or find dedicated services that don't charge over £100 per session, any recommendations on how to narrow my search or specific recommendations of services that operate online/via phone across the UK would be greatly appreciated.","English ADHDers, any tips or recommendations for finding CBT counsellor who offer ADHD centred counselling?"

ADHD,"I never really believed my diagnosis of ADHD-pi. I suspected it, but the more I read about what people experience, the more I question if I'm actually ADHD-pi, because I don't think my symptoms match up the same way. I should also point out I've been told I suffer from General Anxiety Disorder as well. Nonetheless, here's my experience:

I suspected I might have ADHD-pi, because I would tell my doctor I always felt like I was living in a fog. I wasn't even sure if that was the right term, but that's what I'd call it. I always feel stuck in my head, both mentally and physically. Like there's a filter between my sense and it makes me almost unable to connect with the world. I know this sounds similar to DPDR, but I don't think that's it. I told my GP I wanted to get tested for ADHD-pi, and the psychologist diagnosed me with it. Again, not sure how confident I am in the diagnosis (self thoughts: ""Did I exaggerate how bad I experience some things, was my problems doing the evaluation tasks actually because of anxiety, or was it in fact ADHD-pi, etc."").

**Symptoms I experience:**

 - One thing I always noticed was how well people could get lost in doing things. A lot of times when I'd talk to people while they were texting, they would completely drown me out to the point where I had to repeat myself multiple times before it'd register to them enough to take their focus away. I always had the exact opposite. If I was texting, I couldn't get lost enough in it to drown out other people. I'd respond immediately. Was it because I was unable to focus enough on texting, that them asking me a question could simply pull my attention to them easily? Was it my anxiety telling me that it's rude to ignore someone talking, so I should make sure to answer immediately if someone asked a question even if I'm texting, which would cause me to make sure my attention was available even while trying to text? Probably the former, but I don't know. Anyways, that's one symptom

 - When talking to important people, like coworkers (I say important because you obviously have to be careful so you don't get fire), I would constantly be stuck in my head when conversing about work related topics. If I asked a question, while they were repsonding, I would be less focused on what they were actually saying, and more worried about if I was making a face that showed I was paying attention. Did I look like I knew what he was talking about? Did I look annoyed? Bored? Oh man, I don't understand any of this. Does he think I'm dumb? God I'm so dumb, why don't I understand any of this? Next thing you know he's done talking, and not a lot registered. Now this doesn't seem to be much of an issue when I am more confident and understand the material better, but the second I realize I don't understand something, negative self talk, doubt about myself, etc kicks in pretty bad. Is this a general anxiety thing, or an ADHD thing? I don't know.

 - I physcially feel stuck in my head. Like there's literally a filter between myself and the world. Makes it near impossible to actually connect to the outside worms. It's almost as if all my sense go through a filter in my head, and stop there, as opposed to my senses extending outside my head. I basically experience life inside my head. Not ""behind"" my head I don't think, but like there's a super, super thin sheet of glass directly in front of my eyes/senses that makes connecting to actual life just out reach. Really hard to explain, but this symptom alone causes a lot of problems. 

- Even if I actively try not to make a mistake, there will more than likely still be a mistake made somewhere

 - I have a hard time staying focused for a long time at work, especially when a problem comes up. If I know what In doing, and am confident I know what I'm doing, there's less anxiety. But the interesting this is, the more confident I feel in my ability to do a project, the more I procrastinate. ""Ah, I know I could easily do this, let's go do something else for a bit and then come back and finish this up quick at the end of the day"". Only problem is nothing ever goes as fast as I think it does. Therefore I end up procrastinating and cramming at the end. I don't think I ever did this with school work, I actually preferred to get homework out the way right away so I could spend my time playing videogames or whatever, but that mindset has changed now that I work.

- I have *zero* organizational skills. Literally zero. My brain legitamately cannot compute how to organize. Even if I tried I don't think I could do it. My workstation was always a complete mess when I was in the office. Even now at my work from home office, there's shit everywhere. If put something down, my brain will not register it, and I'll lose it

 • I basically have a hard time focusing on anything. I literally cannot zone out while doing something. Zoning out while doing something, to me, sounds like having such a strong focus on something, that you can't pay attention to anything else. I have the opposite problem. I seriously cannot focus in on anything. Not really even stuff I like.

 - I have constant negative self talk. I also have zero confidence in my abilities. Maybe a general anxiety thing, maybe an ADHD-pi thing. I don't know.

 - I overthink things, a lot. At my old job I would ask questions about work that he would go, ""Man, you ask questions I don't think even think of. I've never thought that deep about it."" He never said it in a rude way, but it made me realize how much I over think things, and I think this is a symptom of trying to compensate for a lack of understanding things. I try to understand everything about a given topic, so that I can understand the overall topic it at a basic level. Which leads me to my next symptom

 - I have to ask a lot of questions in order to understand something deeply, otherwise I won't truly understand it. I school, I would ask questions non-stop (either to the teacher, or in my head if I didn't want to hold the class up) because if I didn't understanding something at a fundamental level, then I knew I just couldn't grasp the concept. An example would be I felt I couldn't truly grasp electricity (in order to be a successful electrician) unless I understand electricity down to the level of what quarks are and how they work. I would try to understand every single aspect of something's just to understand it at a level most others could. Even then I couldn't grasp it. I feel like a jack of all trades with knowledge. I understand a decent amount of everything, but not a whole lot of anything. I have basically factoids and fragments of knowledge, but it never becomes a cohesive understanding of anything in whole

 - My mind feels blank all the time. I often hear of ADHD people having too much ""background sound"" in their head, like random bits of music, daydreaming, etc. Going on, but I always felt the exact opposite problem. It's like my mind is blank. Just crickets. It makes it hard to form complete thoughts, and it's why I'm an awful teacher (also because again, I don't understand anything at a deep enough level). It's like the gears in my head turn slowly than most people. I'm not dumb by any means either, but it's hard to explain. My mind is just more blank and less busy than other ADHD people, and even normal people, it seems. Hence why it's hard for me to grape things, I assume.

This is all I can think of right now. I'll add more as I think of them

But nonetheless, is this all because of a General anxiety disorder, ADHD-pi, both? Wish I knew...","Those that suffer from ADHD-pi, is this similar to your experience?

ADHD,"Warning: long post! 

Thank you in advance for always being so supportive and helpful in this community! 

My first dose was 27 mg of Concerta and the first 2 days were overwhelming emotionally. I felt so calm, less anxious and my brain was less foggy and more quiet. I cried because I felt hope again in my life and that I could see a better future for me. After 4 weeks, my dose was increased to 37mg and there was no difference. Question here: will another increase make a difference or should 37 mg or less be enough? Was the increase to small? Or will Adderall work better? What is your experience?

Reason why I am asking is because I feel like I am only receiving 40-50% of the benefits. I still feel spaced out on my meds, but not as much as I used to. Sometimes I feel like my brain is overpowering the medication which makes me question the severity of my ADHD. I am still in the early phases, but any shared experiences can help me better understand the effects of the medication and my situation. 

Side note 1: I am not seeking that high I got the first 2 days. Not trying to go down the path of substance abuse! Just trying to find the right dose and type that will give the most benefit longterm. 

Side note 2: I am also suffering from depression which is important to factor in. I believe my depression stems from family problems and not triggered by my ADHD. This leads me to think that I can't get the max benefits from the medication. Is anyone taking ADHD meds and antidepressants simultaneously? 

Side note 3: I have my next appointment in 3 weeks so trying to journal my daily experience and moods to better understand myself and communicate an accurate experience to my psychiatrist so she can make a better judgment.",Increase dose or switch to Adderall?
ADHD,"Sorry for the lenghty rant — my head is in places and I feel the need to let it all out.

I have slowly started to accept the fact that I will just stick to a 9 to 5 job. I had big dreams of studying animation in a university and maybe working in movies or video games, whatever, I just wanted to be creative. 

I loved drawing, it’s something I did for hours and hours and then at some point it just stopped. I don’t know why but I ended up having a 5 year break so I was lacking in talent and technique. A couple of years back I tried to get back to it, worked really hard, applied for university and failed the entrance exams. I failed basically every other school’s entrance exams that I applied to. 

I got into a community college to study marketing just so I could get somewhere with my life, but I’m not happy with it. I’m upset that no matter how hard I try, I still feel like I am stupid and weird and my brain just —can’t function the way I want. I can’t focus on the things I want to do no matter how hard I try. 

Now I’m seeing people graduating and starting on their jobs while I’m just depressed of what my future will be. I’m turning 25 soon and I’m sad that I am falling behind on everything that I planned to do. I’m trying to be merciful to myself and say that I shouldn’t compare myself to everyone but I don’t know how to overcome it.

I can’t help but think that what if I got diagnosed a lot earlier in my life (I have been on hold for two years due to the lack of resources in my city and I finally got the call that I will soon have my first appointment with the whole ADHD process) and had the proper tools that I could work with, would my life be any different? Would I have been able to achieve at least something I wanted to?

ADHD,"I’ve been experimenting with Vyvanse (20-40mg) for the past 2-3 months. Besides the euphoria of the first 2 days, I can’t quite tell if it’s working sometimes. On 20mg I have the feeling like it may be not working enough.... on 40mg I feel similar but also don’t knock the possibility of actually being overstimulated. 
So I decided to try Concerta for a couple weeks to see if it would make me feel different. 

They actually prescribed me 18mg, when the equivalent of the Vyvanse dose would be around 27-36mg. So I said fuck it and took two 18mg pills this morning.. 4 hours ago to be exact..

And I don’t think it’s having any effect, I don’t know.. I was hungry when I took it.... still pretty damn hungry lol

I may try Adderall next and if that’s too weird, just stick with the Vyvanse.

ADHD,"Hi all.

Tl;dr : my GP sent me a questionnaire to assess herself if I have ADHD or not. I thought I needed to see a neurologist or psychiatrist for that evaluation. Is it okay to do this with the GP ?

---
I've just discovered this sub a week ago and reading all your posts made me decide to finally take the step towards making an appointment for an ADHD evaluation since so many of your stories resonated in a way I couldn't believe possible.

I've been thinking about this for a long time now, almost a year, from dismissing the idea to accepting the possibility. I've called to grab some information about the process in a ADHD clinic. At first the price made me think about it twice (as it was around 1500$) but I've been told it was expensive anyway so I took the time to make peace with it before calling my GP to get a prescription in order to make an appointment to the ADHD clinic.

When I was on the phone with the GP, she asked me why I wanted to get an evaluation and asked me about my symptoms. Then she told me I didn't need to go see a neurologist or a psychiatrist for the evaluation in a clinic, that she will send me a self-report questionnaire to fill in by mail to send her back so she could start the medication based on my answers.

When I asked her if it was usual, she said that, given my symptoms, I was an ""obvious"" case and that people going to see the neurologist for an evaluation was more because it was harder to diagnose them.

I am in Canada. The file she sent me is from the Canadian ADHD Ressources Alliance and have all the questions you can find on the DSM-V for the self-report ADHD evaluation.

Yet, I am confused, I was under the impression that only a psychiatrist or neurologist could assess and give an official (recognized) diagnosis after several appointments, including one with your family.

Can my GP properly assess my symptoms just over a PDF file ?
Whatever the conclusion she reaches, will it be officially recognized ?
Why would she ask to do this that way ?

Don't get me wrong, I am more than ok with it not costing me 1500$, but I want to be sure to have someone skilled enough in this area and also, I really want answers for once.",Can your General Practitioner assess your ADHD diagnosis ? I'm really confused right now.

ADHD,"Hey /r/ADHD

I got my diagnosis a few weeks back, which is awesome as it means I got access to prescription Elvanse to help me with focus. My job is pretty intense in organisation skills and time management, so meds seems like a good idea to help me with this just when I know I'm going to have a long day. The plan is to not take my meds unless I have to if possible.

I took my first Elvanse 30mg yesterday and for 3 or 4 hours I felt uber productive and like I coukd take on the world. Then all of a sudden it started to wear off, and all my symptoms started to creep back in. By 5pm I was a potato and felt the need to go to bed. By 9pm I was a mess, on the brink of vomiting, sensitive to light, throbbing headache and super crazy dizzy. One of the worst experiences I've ever had.

I got to sleep relatively easy at around midnight, but then waking up this morning I still felt incredibly dizzy and still had the throbbing headache. It's almost 3pm and I'm still feeling like this. I've eaten food and drunk a solid litre and a half of water and I'm still not getting better.

Has anybody on this subreddit ever felt this level of come down after just a single first 30mg pill? I was too scared to take my one today for fear of making it worse!

ADHD,"Long story short; The psychiatrist who diagnosed me seemed very unprofessional. She just handed me a self-evaluation sheet, and after two sessions, she concluded I had ADHD.  


Recently I started doing my methylphenidate medicine again, and I am starting to think it might not be ADHD? I get extremely energized, almost to the point where I cannot sit still. Surely methylphenidate/Ritalin should have the opposite effect if I indeed do have ADHD?  


Anybody else experience the same thing?",Adderall Effects: Maybe it's not ADHD afterall?
ADHD,"This is the first post I have ever made on reddit.  I have not been diagnosed with ADHD since my parents did not believe in psychology growing up and had a general distrust for it.  I have just begun seeing a psychologist for depression and ADHD issues that have been having a very negative effect on my life for a very long time.  For the record,  I have been having pretty severe ADHD symptoms as long as I can remember.  I have always *hated* doing homework, and when I say hated, I mean it was mentally painful.  This was not because I was not capable of doing it, but because of the extended mental effort it took to complete it.  Besides that, I simply had no interest in it.  I spent most of my childhood outside, adventuring in the woods, playing with my dog and shooting BB guns.  Onto the topic of this post, I have always had extreme difficulty in containing my impulses.  If I had the impulse to say something mean to someone because I was very angry, I did it.  I felt bad about it after, but I could not stop myself from doing it.  This alienated me from my peers and teachers because I thought they saw me as someone who was destructive, uncontrollable, unpredictable and perhaps even dangerous.  It was not that I was not kind, I was, but I was always the one who was constantly disrupting classes, breaking the rules and doing things that the teachers did not want me to be doing.  I wanted to pay attention in class, and believe me my parents tried as hard as they could to get that message through my head, but I just couldn't.  I would lose half of my assignments, half-finish the rest, and forget that papers were due constantly.  I constantly misplace everything, and constantly forget appointments to my utter dismay.  I feel shameful for missing my appointments because I really care about my teachers and I don't want them to feel that I don't care but I literally cannot remember them.  As this has gone on my whole life, and because I am only now receiving counseling support, my whole life I have had a pretty deep belief that there is simply something wrong with me.  That I am somehow morally defective because I cannot do what everybody else can seemingly so easily.  Every time I say I'm not going to do something that I know is not in my best interest, I do it anyways, because in the moment, it feels good.  It's very very very difficult to stop myself from doing things I know are harmful to me in the long run, but feel great in the short term.  This applies to everything from promiscuous sex to using drugs and vaping.  Adding to that my Christian background, and the fact that I feel I should be able to control my temptations to do risky things: use drugs, vape, have a lot of sex with different people, speed and drive dangerously.  It all around makes me feel kind of worthless that I have so little ability to control myself and my actions.  It also kind of alienates me from other people because it seems so easy for other people in comparison to myself.  I was just feeling depressed tonight and I wanted to vent here.  If anyone has similar experiences or stories I look forward to reading them.  If you have read all the way through, I thank you, you are probably one of the few, and you probably empathize a lot with my story.  Thank you.",Do you ever feel like your implulsivity/lack of ability to control risk-taking behavior makes you feel like a morally defective person?
ADHD,"Okay so, first thing's first, I feel the need to explicitly state that I'm okay. I'm not anorexic or bulemic or otherwise looking to get Really Skinny. I just wanna stabilise at a size slightly smaller than what I am.

Anyway, over lockdown I've been noticing that I'm getting bigger. Before all this I'd go on walks around town almost daily, but thanks to my asthma I'm incredibly paranoid about going out and potentially getting covid. Additionally, I have a snacking problem; since food is one of very few guaranteed ways to get dopamine I find myself just mindlessly munching on crunchy snacks on the daily, something that used to be at least somewhat balanced out by my daily walks.

Now I'm very much interested in losing some weight; not a lot, just a few inches; I got this really nice suit from a charity shop a few years ago and all I want is to be able to fit into it again because honestly I looked good in it lol, but the problem I recognise is that weight loss is very much a Long Term Goal, and we all know how adhd brains fail to deal with Long Term Goals.

So basically does anyone have any advice?",(tw body image? Kinda?) requesting weight loss advice
ADHD,"Correct me if I'm wrong (yes I see the irony, but I meant to say \*criticized\*), but I've been attributing this to poor working memory, and I don't know if it's something common.

Recently, I started a new job in food service, and during training, the person training me would correct me as I was doing things. They'd tell me what to do right, which I appreciate, but it would throw me off and make me forget what I was doing, so I'd just end up doing things worse. I don't know how to communicate how this style of criticism doesn't work for me and what to do instead.

The same thing happens if I'm driving (I'm actually a pretty stellar driver) and someone tries to tell me where to go or to watch out for an exit or try to suggest an alternative route. I end up not knowing what to focus on and just get really frazzled and end up driving worse.

I know my abilities and I know I'm a really capable person, but being corrected in the middle of an action screws up my flow, makes me worry about too many things, and my work suffers. Should I ask people to just give me feedback retroactively when possible?",I hate being corrected while I'm doing something
ADHD,"I got diagnosed at age 19, and looking back, it shocks me so much how something so debilitating went undiagnosed for so long. In addition, ADHD is technically invisible in the sense I can't see it with my naked eyes (although one can observe one's own behavior over a long period of time to notice any troubling patterns, which I did). If something as terrible and invisible as ADHD can screw me over, what else is out there??? I guess COVID-19 could work as an example, but the SARS-CoV-2 virus is much easier to observe and analyze than ADHD I presume? 

Like, it's funny, I feel like my *mere existence* is threatened all the time, much less my goals in life. Has anyone else felt this sense of paranoia if you were diagnosed at a relatively late age?","This might be unjustified, but I keep wondering what other subtle thing will screw me over in the future"
ADHD,"I'm in my mid-20s. Back in the late 2000s when I was in HS, FB has just become famous and smartphones weren't as famous (at least not in my school). 

For half of my HS years we didn't have internet at home. Even though we could easily afford it, I don't remember why. 

But what I do remember was that I could stack up my notebooks and books and hyperfocus for hours on end studying for exams. I went from one of the academically lowest in our HS batch to graduating at top 3 of our batch and was awarded best in Mathematics - Calculus and Trigonometry. 

In 2011, when social media and smartphones became more popular is when the ADHD recklessness and procrastination reared its ugly head. I was in a college dorm with no parents to police me and all the internet, booze, junk foods, and booze at my disposal.

I just couldn't sit still and study straight like I did in HS. That's when my sleep problems started too. Back in HS I would sleep at 9pm now I fall asleep at around 4am.

And also, many people (non-ADHDers) can function quite well despite all these tech.

Sometimes I start to question and doubt if I do have ADHD and it's just the social media, internet, and smartphones?

I mean, my mom and cousins seem to have it and I did show symptoms even in early childhood (impatient, impulsive, seems less mature than kids my age, overly talkative, etc.).  I've been to the best psychiatrists in my country and all unanimously agree that I have ADHD and was diagnosed at 20 yo.

I feel like the doubts I'm having about my ADHD (despite the signs) are just a subconscious way of coping, so I'd like to get your thoughts.

How do you know that you guys truly have ADHD and it's not just our modern tech?

FYI - I've been called a coffee guzzler by colleagues from different jobs/companies. Idk if that counts for something lol.",Do you feel that your ADHD got worse with the rise of smartphones and social media?
ADHD,"To the people that take medication: How frequent do you take them? And if you take then irregularly, is it because of its side effects? Just wanted to get informed if meds are a long 
term solution for someone with adhd.

Although my mother knows in what way meds could help people with adhd (standard functioning instead of kick) she says I should only take them before tests when I need to concentrate, because of its side effects.

I don't really agree, because deducing from the posts I have read, it could really help me in my day to day life, as I struggle a lot with practically every common symptom, hypersensitivity and anxiety. Given that it could help me in such an immense way, I don't think the side effects would bother me much/I'm happy to accept them. But of course I don't know how my body will react.

ADHD,"Part of having ADHD for me seems to me a massive disconnect between the things I need to do and how to do them. Trying to understand the steps I need to follow in order to get things done, and then actually \*do\* them? Feels like an impossibility. It feels like everyone around me is speaking gibberish, and I can only remember fragments of even important conversations. When I first went to get tested I was so happy to finally be figuring out what's going on, and if I got diagnosed I'd be eager to get medicated and I could finally get on track in school. I knew I would get medicated ASAP if I got a diagnosis.

But I got a diagnosis, and then I didn't. I got my diagnosis in January. I just don't know how to go about getting medicated. I know the simple answer is probably go to my PCP, I think that's what the guy who tested me said, but it's a children's doctor because I'm 22 and haven't found a new one yet (another thing I haven't gotten around to) can they even prescribe something? Who prescribes things? Is it a therapist, psychiatrist, someone else? Do I need to be assessed by another doctor, or can I just walk in with my diagnosis and ask about medication? Do I need to be screened or something, because I've heard from friends with ADHD that they have to prove that they really need it extensively in order to actually be prescribed something. Sometimes I feel like an alien walking the planet, everything feels impossible and confusing, and combined with my anxiety surrounding asking dumb questions, I just don't get things done because I'm too afraid of people seeing that I don't know what I'm doing and I need help.

That's why I'm coming here lol... those of you who are medicated, how exactly do you do it? If someone could literally write it out in the simplest steps possible, and everything that happens in the process, that'd be great.

i just realized how much adhd makes me get on my own ass its like i always procrastinate then i dont then if i feel like i do then i feel bad??

ADHD,"I am on 10mg adderall XR and 150mg Wellbutrin XL that I take daily. I don’t have any noticeable side effects (I had terrible anxiety days 4-7 or so but discovered I just wasn’t eating enough even before being medicated which I’ve fixed). Things have been great for the 3-4 weeks or so since then. I don’t put myself in danger at my labor job anymore, I don’t procrastinate my hygiene and housework anymore, I’m able to practice and enjoy my hobbies again, it’s everything I’ve ever wanted. The only problem is I seem to sleep veeeery lightly now when this was never a problem before. I have no problems falling asleep but I wake up every 3-4 hours at the slightest noise and it usually takes me 5-10 minutes to fall back asleep, and I think it has been building up and I’m starting to feel more and more tired. I don’t take the adderall on weekends but the problem persists. Has anyone else experienced this? Any advice for how to sleep deeper? Again, I have no problem falling asleep at a reasonable time. I obviously figure this has something to do with the adderall more than the Wellbutrin but the fact that it still happens Sunday night which is 64 hours after my last dose of adderall makes me wonder",Trouble STAYING asleep?

In this paperwork from when I was 8, they talk about how I fit perfectly with ADHD and how I need all these classroom accommodations, hell I still do. But yet... they never made it official. Later professionals continued to insist to my mother because I couldn’t handle stimulants I couldn’t be, which is just ridiculous. Professionals in my teens just told me they didn’t know, or slapped me with the most universal diagnosis they could- bipolar.

ADHD,"I got diagnosed with adhd last december after family members recommended that I should get checked. So I started taking concerta 72mg.

It also increases my confidence and helps me focus on myself instead of thinking about what others might think of me. 

I'm currently writing a thesis where I have to gather loads of information from around the place to put together a compelling story. I find that concerta takes away my skills to put together a fun story. 

Also when reading listening to complex things I can't really understand. Like I was listening to a financial podcast where they where having a fast conversation and I felt that I couldn't process the information.

Now that I reflect, I think that vyvanse was actually working, especially 40mg greatly helped me focus, just didn't help with the anxiety at all (so I'd be on wikipedia for 8 hours unable to do homework but, you know, that meant I was able to be on wikipedia for 8 hours, whereas normally I'd be unable to stay focused and just bookmark stuff to read """"""later"""""").

ADHD,"Okay so, I think I have ADHD (inattentive mostly) and I finally made the jump and talked to my doctor about a referral to a clinic (hurray!). I'm on a waitlist now, which is fine, I was already anticipating a long wait. For better or worse I work for myself so I at least don't have a boss breathing down my neck on bad days. But in the meantime I've been thinking about what I'm going to tell the docs at the clinic and although I have a list a mile long for my symptoms as an adult, I've got basically nothing for when I was a kid, and I know there's gonna be a lot of emphasis on that when I get an appointment.

Most of the problem is that I simply can't remember, but when I look at specifics, I don't feel like I had many of those issues, at least not until middle school. Most of the articles on ADHD in girls that I see list things like ""being chatty/interrupting people"" or ""being disorganized"". I was neither of those things, if anything I was the opposite. I was super shy and basically never talked, and when I did it was so quiet people used to call me a mouse. And until middle school-ish, I did really well in school without much effort, so there wasn't much of a need for me to compensate, or oppurtunities for me to be disorganized. Sure I daydreamed, and I definitely had times where I was like ""wait, what did the teacher just say?"" or ""I just read this whole page without actually 'reading' it"" but it wasn't really harmful because I could recover fast enough to keep up.

I don't know, I'm second guessing myself a lot right now. I'm afraid that even though I'm suffering now, they'll look at my history and say, ""well you didn't suffer enough back then, so go home"". I'm also worried because I know they'll ask to talk to someone who knew me back then, like my parents, and I don't think they'll be able to back me up. They were and still are great parents, but I didn't really let them in on stuff like that. And then I start thinking, well maybe I don't actually have ADHD, maybe I have a bunch of other stuff that LOOKS like ADHD. But I can relate to so much of the inattentive type's symptoms...bleh.

I have a feeling that medication would greatly improve my quality of life so I could stop feeling like a constant fuck up. I was telling my psych about how I didn't start talking until I was 4 and was in speech class all through elementary school and was turned away from the gifted program because I couldn't pay attention to the test long enough to even complete it. She says this points to some sort of developmental disorder either adhd or autism maybe but I need to get in with a neural psychologist to get any sort of official diagnosis.

Pretty much since my diagnosis, &amp; occasionally before, in typical immigrant fashion, my family has generally had a negative attitude toward the rise of ADHD diagnoses they've seen in the last few decades, &amp; while they don't completely disbelieve that ADD exists, they find it harder to take seriously &amp; definitely are insecure about stigmas &amp; stuff applied to it.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, while I acknowledge that this is the typical boomer mentality w.r.t. this disorder lately, I don't want to immediately dismiss it wihtout thinking / learning more about it first. Personally, I have always felt a strong sense of insecurity talking about having ADD &amp; am always super wary of using my diagosis to excuse my own potential laziness or carelessness. 

based on my knowledge currently, there is some sort of scientific backing to support actual neurological differences in ADHD patients, but accompanied with strong uncertainty. 

If anyone in this group can link me to any significant studies that may have helped them understand / literally believe its existence more, I'd appreciate it &amp; would feel a whole lot better / confident about taking steps to treat my ADD in the future.

ADHD,"Is it a common thing among gamers with ADHD to rapidly be jumping from game to game, sometimes buying them only for play less than 10 hours then want to move on to another? I was at a friends and felt kinda embarassed when he blurted out ""how the hell do you play so many games!?"" I checked out Dauntless then some Hades, then Diablo. I find it to be a hyperfixation, almost to the point where I spend a large amount of time staring at online shops and researching other games to play when I have plenty on my plate.

ADHD,"hi! Today's my second day on Concerta 18mg, and my doctor wants me to double to 36mg in a few days. Before this, I was on adderall xr 40mg for a few months, but I took it very on and off, since I could barely tell if it worked. Sometimes it did help me focus a lot better, and other times it felt kind of useless. My comedowns were also horrible, with extreme anxiety and inability to sleep when the drug started to wear off.

Obviously it's only been a couple days on concerta, but I'm not sure what to be expecting. My heart beats super fast for a while when I take it, and my hands are shaky, which influences my anxiety, making that worse as well. Today, I was also very, very sleepy but that improved a bit once I ate. (I took the pill right after a protein shake and a sandwich though so I feel like I shouldn't have gotten the side effects I did).

My ability to focus felt like it was slightly better but more spacey, and I was more distracted from anxiety and discomfort over my symptoms to really focus on anything else. Is Concerta safe like this? I'm a 22(f) 107 pound university student who is also on 30mg of lexapro.

I have taken Adderall IR in the past, unofficially, and I remember it being the one thing that gave me a feeling of my mind slowing down and clearing up, focusing, and being able to push everything away. However, I also remember pushing some of the things I'd normally blurt out in the process, so when my psychiatrist said I could pick between the Adderall IR and the Concerta, I chose the concerta since I was nervous about the IR changing my personality. Did I make a mistake? Is it too soon to decide, and should I stick to the Concerta / has Concerta worked well for any of you? How do I make the side effects better while I wait? Thank you so much!


Also, I don't know if this affects anything, but my period is supposed to come very soon and is unpredictable in general, and I've heard of this affecting adhd meds.",Concerta side effects giving me anxiety
ADHD,"Hello. I have been taking Concerta for more than a month now. For first 2 weeks I didn't have problem with sleeping. Actually 12 hrs after taking Concerta, I suddenly felt super sleepy and went to bed as if I passed out. 

However since two weeks ago, I don't feel sleepy until 3-4 am, which is 16-17 hrs after taking Concerta. Even though I fell asleep, I kept dreaming through the night. Sometimes I remember what I've dreamed about, sometimes I don't.

The weird thing is that I have been taking the same amount of Concerta (36mg) and I experienced both (passing-out and quasi-insomnia). I'm not sure if it's because of Concerta or other extra medications. The only differences are the amount of alprazolam, fluoxetine and aripiprazole.

 I'll talk to psychiatrist about this on next appointment. I hope I can solve this problem without adding sleeping pills to my enormous pile of medications.",Dreaming a lot since taking Concerta

**TL;DR: I am extremely burned out at work, having a hard time being motivated to do anything and I am stressed the hell out about it and it’s getting worse by the day. I don’t know what to do to make this situation manageable and I feel very hopeless. Any advice on how to manage the stress and get shit caught up at work without working a shit ton of overtime (which I don’t get paid for because I’m salaried) would be greatly appreciated.**

THE LONGER AND MORE DETAILED STORY:

I work at a financial start-up and have been at my job for several years. I am the only employee that has been with the company since the very beginning. In addition to working with clients, I also help answer phones, deal with all outgoing mail and a variety of other admin tasks.

So I was burned out at my job and thinking of looking for a new position even prior to COVID. Then when the pandemic hit, I fell hard from the top of the depression tree and hit every branch down. I am the caretaker for a parent with stage 4 lung cancer, didn’t want to learn a new job remotely or worse, be forced to work outside the home, so I stayed put. 

Well, the burnout got much worse. Had a productive period around summertime, got diagnosed with my ADHD in August and got treatment for the first time, hit another depression lull in October and it’s been rough ever since. Since then, it has been a battle and a half to get motivated enough to do ANYTHING and I am falling further and further behind. My boss hired help to start at the beginning of the year to assist me and she was terrible and also ended up quitting a few weeks ago and between having to train her and also correct the plethora of mistakes she made, she ended up taking up more of my time and putting me even more behind than I was to start with.

I end every single day feeling more behind than I started. Every time I try to put in significant time to getting my inbox caught up, I end up getting so many emails during the day that it negates any progress I have made. It feels every day is another iteration of “what did I do wrong/what did I miss/what did I forget”  and I never feel like I’ve accomplished anything, even when I’ve had a busy and productive day. It is  EXHAUSTING feeling like I can’t do anything right 24/7.

At this rate, the stress is really wearing on me physically. I’m perpetually fatigued, I’ve had multiple panic attacks over the last several months, I cry pretty much on a daily basis and last week, I got stress hives for the first time ever. I know the obvious answer here is to find a new job and I’m looking but having a hard time finding anything that I’m interested in, qualified for and/or that does not want to pay me an insultingly low salary (I’m willing to trade a pay cut for my mental health to some degree but I have bills to pay and a sick parent to take care of so I can’t just accept anything).

I just feel so discouraged and hopeless. I don’t know how to get my stress to a manageable level. Getting through the work week feels like it’s an insane challenge that I don’t know how to get through anymore. I used to be a total machine and now every email I get sends me into a down spiral again. How do I manage until I find something else?",I just can’t do anything and I don’t know how to make it better...
ADHD,"so, just a quick warning: i’m in my teens and i’m 99% sure i have adhd but it hasn’t been proven by any medical professionals, so i’m just trying to figure out is this thing in any way related to adhd.


despite being incredibly fast while just “peacefully” walking without a rush, i have this thing of, in some periods of time, literally, planning every step while i do that. it might be hard to explain, but i just walk in some kind of pattern, like when the road is in slabs, bricks or any other dividing thing, i have an unconscious “rule” of walking only like i’m on a checker board or skipping one slab and etc.


also i sometimes have this thing that i call “tasks”. for example: “ok, i need to walk to that street light in 5 seconds or something bad’s gonna happen this year”. i don’t have them as frequently as i did when i was a kid, but it still happens.


does it have to do anything with adhd? does anybody else have that? if it doesn’t - i’m sorry, i really am just trying to figure stuff out. also, if anybody read this till this point, i’d appreciate if you dropped a couple undescribed symptoms that you didn’t realise were adhd, or something like that. because i still don’t know are stuff that i do “normal” or not and would like some advice.",planning every step on a walk

ADHD,"I've recently found out I probably have ADHD. It answers a lot of questions I've had for a long time, and I've also realized just how much I hold back in telling people what I've screwed up or forgotten. I've started telling my parents more of just the day to day mess ups and they're a little taken aback, because they've gotten used to a different version of me.

I've been in therapy for a while because I have other issues. I developed an alcohol addiction a few years ago. I stopped drinking but my anxiety and depression remained pretty bad. I have found some tools that have helped me a lot, such as reframing and positive affirmations. I take medication. I still struggle with things I know will really help, like eating healthily, exercising regularly, and meditating regularly.

There's something I still have not figured out. I'm a grad student and I have an exam I need to study for that includes a presentation in two months. I felt like I was running out of time weeks ago. I just. can't. study. I set time in the calendar on Friday to study and in the morning was pumped to do it. But by the end of the day I knew it wasn't going to happen, because the whole day went well except for one short meeting where afterward I felt so stupid that it affected me until the middle of the next day. I set time in the calendar again for Monday and it's passed and I didn't start.

It feels like such a bad, terrible idea to start. Like I'll somehow make things worse if I start. It sounds ridiculous explaining it. But when I have managed to get myself to do it over the past few weeks, I can barely make it through one page of a textbook. Like my emotions are so high and so tied to this that I can't process more than 5 paragraphs a day.

If anyone has had experience with this, what have you done to deal with the extremely strong emotions in the moment? In the past, I drank to calm the emotions. This was a very bad idea, because I didn't focus too well when I was drinking either. I have trouble thinking over my emotions, I have trouble countering them because I still don't know exactly what it is that I'm afraid of.

And it's not like, at this moment, I'm having trouble reading. For the last hour, I've been reading about the different buildings in my new^(\*) city.

My assessment lasted an entire day (9:30-5:00) and I even had to go back for another couple of hours of testing. The psychologist wanted to do an educational assessment in order to make recommendations to the school for accommodations which is why it took so long. 

However, now I'm worried that I did too well on some of the tests and she's going to say I don't have ADHD, it's just depression or something. 

I'm not sure how an assessment is supposed to go but it seemed we focused more on academics, and listening, and remembering tasks than anything else.

ADHD,"I'm really sorry this is so long, there is a tl;dr at the end. 

Hi, so I'm 16 and in March 2020 I got my learner's permit. 

In August 2020 I got into a car accident. I was in the left turning lane on a big intersection and I was getting ready to turn left. All I remember is seeing the car turning right in front of me and my stepmother yelling stop then the airbags going off. 

All that happened was that I ran through a red light turning left and hit the car turning right in the lane across from me in the intersection. I don't purposefully run red lights, I especially don't drive recklessly as my family has gotten into many accidents before. 

It felt like my mind had gone on autopilot. I stopped thinking, I stopped registering that I was driving a car, It was like I blacked out. I saw the light turn yellow then red but I didn't register that it happened. Right before I hit the car my stepmom yelled at me to stop and I was suddenly thinking and able to register what was happening but at that point, it was too late and I couldn't avoid hitting them. Since I was turning left, I continued turning without realizing it and hit the car in the left turning lane on the road I was turning onto, if that makes sense. I completely totaled two cars and hit a third. 

I would rather not go into what I was experiencing when everything stopped because it's still really traumatizing and it still gives me really bad anxiety just thinking about it.

Thankfully, nobody got seriously hurt. The woman I hit first had a few small cuts on her arm and everyone else was okay. The cops, an ambulance, and a tow truck came and everything got sorted out. 

In October 2020, my mom took me to a psychiatrist and I got diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and ADHD, and have been on varying quantities of Adderall and Prozac since.

Now, 8 months later, I still haven't been behind the wheel of a car. Even being a passenger in cars with drivers who have had years of experience still gives me bad anxiety. My mom once ran through a yellow light in the same intersection and I had an intense panic attack; She pulled over and I sat in the back seat barely able to breathe or even think. 

The problem is, I'm getting a job soon and I have tons of extracurriculars that I need to be able to drive to and from. I want to start driving again but I'm still so afraid that I'll completely blank out while I'm driving again.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I get over it? How do I prevent blanking again like that? Has this happened to anyone else? 

tl;dr I got into a car accident a few months ago because I went on mental autopilot and accidentally ran through a red light and hit two cars. Nobody got injured but 2/3 cars got totaled.

I got prescribed anti depressants and stimulants but my mom said absolutely no to filling the prescription. As an Asian shes always had the mentality that its all in your head and that as Asians our genes are superior and that wouldn’t happen. 

I spent the next 2 years trying to find psychiatrists myself and I finally found one i think exactly a year ago today. Without telling her, I got treated got therapy, improved myself and got my grades and work ethic up.

So what happened since I told her? My parents decided to go to a Psychologist to get couples counseling. My dad realized he had adhd-i, and my mom has symptoms of hyperactivity, and anxiety. Their relationship after weeks of reflection finally got better.

Since then as a family we became more open to the topic of mental health struggles. I was finally able to open up about my mental health without them saying its just in your head. My mom finally talked about her abandonment issues and her chronic anxiety. My dad knows about his adhd but given his age and worklife he has nothing to treat really.

We’ve never had a perfect family life but we are now more open than ever. My mom always had the narrative that she wants to retire from
Her middle school teaching job(which pays her 6 figs) once I graduate. After more discussion, she moved it to “when I find a stable job.” You don’t understand the amount of pressure that relieves from me. Trust me I know i am capable of making 6 figs but I honestly can’t deal with the pressure of having such limited time, especially due to the pandemic. I still want to get my doctorate before I enter the workforce.

What is the lesson here? Well, I just wanted to point that maybe a discussion about mental health within your family doesn’t have to cause trouble. I know you would have anxiety if you did, but if you are able to approach it from a standpoint where you are able to describe your experiences, why they scientifically happen and why its not in your head, and even talk about your parents mental health, then you may reach a point where the discussion can be healthy. I’d like to note that my mom is a science teacher with a masters in special ed while my dad is also a firm believer of science. Despite that we are a very Catholic family and I think it was also helpful to use the fact that we believe we are made perfectly in the eyes of our creator despite our mental struggles.

I am very privileged to have a family that grew to finally accept my mental health struggles. I know others may not be as lucky, but my message is that it’s definitely not impossible. It’s worth a certain amount of effort. But do what you can and how they react to it is out of your control...","I hid my ADHD diagnoses from my mom for years, and one day we got into a huge argument and when it blew up I told her about my ADHD and since then she has been more understanding."
ADHD,"Dawg I had about 1300$ in expenses including rent this month. Im an Uber driver. So I found out my vivance costs 100$. Put that on the back burner.

Ive been on coffee the last week. Good lord. Got me all nervous and tweaking and shit. It doesnt even help me focus. To think that I was deprived of vivance up until 2 months ago.

ADHD,"After watching a video from How to ADHD about bullet journaling, I decided to give it a shot.  I assumed it would be like every notebook or planner I've ever owned where I assumed it'd be the change in my life that would essentially eliminate all my ADHD challenges, but then I give up on it in a couple weeks.  Surprisingly, I am still using it 2 months later.  

If I ever fill this one up and get a new one, I'll make some changes, as there are parts I rarely use.  I never use the key, and the Future Log and monthly calendar seem redundant.  But these are the things I love about it: 

* I can use it in whatever disorganized, creative, fun manner I see fit.  If I feel like drawing on one of the pages, that's exactly what I'll do.  If I feel like adding a section for Book Bingo in the middle of the notebook I can.  
* I can use it for multiple purposes. Specifically, things that I need help with.  For instance, I have a section for ""important phone calls you need to make, Movies I want to watch, Books I want to read, and most importantly, I put in my daily ""to-dos.""  The daily ""to-dos"" are messy and spaced out where I decide to put them, but they are a life saver, since I thrive on physical check lists.
* I was able to pick out a super cute one that makes me happy each time I hold it. 
* I bought adorable planner stickers at the Dollar Tree that make me feel excited every time I put one in.
* I don't have to feel guilty if I don't use it every day. 
* I can color in the journal whenever I feel like it.
* I can use cheap Dollar Tree tabs to mark the important pages I want to quickly go back to.

Overall this is a strategy that is really working for me right now. Who knows if it will work forever for me (knowing me, it won't).  And I know it won't for many other people, but I thought it might be a good alternative to the millionth planner we all know we're only going to use for the first few weeks in January.",Bullet Journaling has become my lifesaver
ADHD,"I just watched a video of a neurotypical taking a negative stance against stim meds for ADHD because of their own experience with addiction to them. One main point made during the video is that ""They're giving meth to little kids!"" which really got me thinking. We all know the way ADHD meds are treated is wack. Someone wouldn't freak out and say ""They're giving methylxanthine (caffeine stimulant class) to little kids!"" It's just a can of coke. The thing that makes a molecule a drug is its effect on humans, not something inherent about the structure of the compound itself. I think it's hard for nt ppl (and ADHD ppl through external reinforcement) to disconnect the molecule's inherent structure or name from the effects it has on (most) humans. No matter how well it's communicated that ""It doesn't get ADHD people high,"" it's still MeTh (I know that Adderall and Vyvanse aren't technically ""meth,"" but the primary difference is the absorption rate, having very similar effects on nt ppl at equivalent doses). If everybody (or the majority of people) reacted to stimulants the way that most ADHD people do, stims probably wouldn't even be regulated, or they would be regulated on the same level as ""acceptable drugs"" like alcohol and nicotine (that's a rant for another day). Imagine walking into a coffee shop and getting a Methylphenidate muffin or Amphetamine gummy bears. To (most) ADHD people, meds are no more abusable than caffeine is (which certainly isn't zero risks, but you can't deny how incredibly different they're treated). Nobody wants to feel like a robot from taking too high a dose, in the same way that nobody wants to experience caffeine jitters. I still feel some imposter-syndrome and external judgment related guilt taking my Adderall IR any more than once every other day, even though it really helps me. I really wish that I could take my meds and it not be treated any differently than my friends' morning coffee. I'm lucky enough that my parents don't think I'm an addict, but my dad still gives me shit saying ""I don't want you to become dependent. You worked fine without meds for years."" I know you aren't talking mister 6 shots of espresso a day. Who's really the dependant one here?",Meds Demonisation and Bogus Societal Logic
ADHD,"I lost my job last month. They felt I was “behind” from what they expected from me, although I excelled in the beginning. I was angry that I was never made aware of my work or issues they had with me, and I felt led on by myself- where I thought I stood. It was a surprise to me and I enjoyed my job and most of my coworkers- as much as I hate “work”. 

Since then I’ve been thinking more of my issues and I suppose it makes sense that I seem like someone who just doesn’t get it. I went to school and I have trouble accessing the knowledge I paid for. I get caught off guard by questions I should know the answer to. I hear someone talking but I’m not really there- I’m thinking of something else I need to do but I look like I’m listening- you’d never know I’m not. I constantly check in to make sure I’m making the right choice and won’t make anyone mad if I do a thing. 

Then other than work theres the emotional disregulation, hyperfixation, needing to do 100 things so I do nothing at all, my mind constantly screaming at me to move and do things but I just scroll on the web for 3 hours straight. I’ve been a echo chamber for myself being “lazy”, but I want to do so much I just find it hard to make the first step. 

My GP diagnosed me with ADHD when I was in my late teens, but everyone thought that was silly- I’m not hyper I’m depressed! I bought it and never took the medication. I wanted to not be depressed and anxious, so we dealt with that. The last few years I have changed. The depression is not depression as I remember it, and it’s hardly even there. I’ll be depressed now and again for short periods but it’s not the same. I have spent this time trying to explain how I feel to doctors, but they tell me to just take the medication- otherwise what else can they do. I’ve never felt that medication worked for me, and no matter how many times I explained it, I was just put on a different one. Now I refuse, and have been refusing. Doctors hardly take me seriously- and then I think to myself “how do I come across?”. Scatterbrained and scared, unable to explain and describe or remember... I’m a mess. I’m working against myself. 

Learning more about ADHD I’ve learned that I identify completely, and I decided that’s my goal. I explained to my new doctor and he’s making me get a work up by a professional in that area- it’s been 2 months and I haven’t heard from the referral. Since then I have lost my job. I am struggling more and more to keep up with basic chores and I really don’t know why. Sometimes I don’t even go for a shower for days because I just don’t want to- I have more enjoyable things to do. I can’t sleep because I feel like I’m missing out on time- I hardly even feel tired. When I do try to sleep my mind is RACING- either plans or scenarios. Sometimes I won’t eat when I’m hungry because I don’t wanna stand there and cook it- sometimes I won’t eat because I’m so engrossed in what I’m doing that it never crosses my mind. My good habits are continuing to be terrible because I can’t control myself around the good sugary stuff- I’m screaming in my head to make better choices and that I don’t need something as I’m eating it. 

I feel so out of control. I’m full of frustration and anger. I just want it to stop. Why can’t I just do the things? I plan so hard. I know who I am- why am I just not being that person?",Losing myself and my mind. Tired of waiting for help.
ADHD,"Im not entirely sure how to describe it, and I am honestly not sure if this is an ADHD problem or a depression problem, I have both and I find it hard to differentiate the source of the motivational struggles that can come with both but.. 

Does anyone find that they fall into these.. periods where nothing Hits Right? Like the space inbetween a new hobby or interest where you have several things you can do, several things you should do, but nothing itches that scratch?

I got back into World of Warcraft at the beginning of the new expansion. I got super duper into it, I convinced people to join again, or try it for the first time and it was super fun for a few weeks, really disruptive of my studies lmao but I enjoyed myself. And then one day my brain decided that this isnt fun anymore, this is the most boring thing ever and you're done with it.

I assume you're all familiar with this feeling, heh.

And sometimes this happens because you find something new and shiny and interesting right, jumping from hobby to hobby, I usually do that at least, but sometimes...

Man sometimes you lose interest in one thing without a new thing to focus on and it is the worst. I have so much energy I want to spend on something and I am literally surrounded by stuff I can do, my apartment is filled with stuff to play with but the moment I pick anything up I loose momentum because its Not The Right Thing apparently. 

I've reached that point of boredom where it feels like it physically hurts my brain in some weird way.

I'm not sure where I'm going with this tbh, I guess I'm just tired of this feeling and need to complain to someone who might understand what I'm rambling about... :)",The void between hyperfixations
ADHD,"So I was recently diagnosed with ADHD and my doctor prescribed me Wellbutrin to take as I wait for my second evaluation to confirm I have ADHD. (even though I have every symptom and had family to support my statements) Which is strange because she's a psychiatrist, she's able to prescribe me Adderall. She even said that my ADHD is really bad and is surprised that I went so long without help and that I'll probably have to go on a simulate. She said it's ""just to make sure I'm not faking just to get Adderall."" Wow, totally not judgmental! I don't have any history or signs that I have abused medicine. She says she does that with everyone so idk maybe she's just like that. Anyways, does anyone have experience taking Wellbutrin? Because I'm on it right now and it's horrible for me. I can't sleep, eat, or even relax. I have tremors, I feel even more restless than I did before and I feel like I'm EXTRA HYPERAWARE of every thought I have now so it makes it worse since it's not even helping me calm down or slow down my brain. I emailed my doctor about the symptoms and how it feels horrible. She just said to keep taking them until my next appointment with a different psychiatrist which is a month from now in April. Has anyone had any bad experience with Wellbutrin? I've searched everywhere but it seems like I'm the only one that's having a terrible reaction. And if you did take it how did you cope with all the side effects? How was switching from Wellbutrin to Adderall go? Sorry if this is all over the place, my thoughts are less coherent at the moment.   


TLDR- Psychiatrist says I have ADHD, said I needed Adderall. She gave me Wellbutrin instead and scheduled me for a second eval with another Psych because ""people fake ADHD to get Adderall, gotta make sure you're not one of them"".

ADHD,"Disclaimer: I am not yet diagnosed, I have my appt with a psychiatrist later this month, but after talking with my psychologist and reading widely on adhd, I will eat my hat if I don't have it. 

Three months ago my psychologist did a self reporting test with me to see if some of the struggles that I have been having may be caused by ADHD. My results were highly consistent with ADHD, and at first it was a relief to finally have a name other than lazy, scatterbrained or just not attentive. I've been waiting since then for an appt with my psychiatrist for my official diagnosis, and its been a long three months. 

I am very lucky and managed to do well in school and bumble my way through uni and jump from job to job, but always progressing my career. I'm happy with how my school and work has gone in my life and I have no regrets there. 

But when I started reading how ADHD effects relationships, it really hit me hard and I can see how I have really made it difficult for previous partners, or made impulsive decisions to leave which I later regretted. I can see that my being undiagnosed and uneducated about ADHD has let a lot of difficult behaviours go unchecked, which has ruined relationships with really incredible people that at the time I could see myself spending the rest of my life with. 

I'm reaching out to see how people with similar experiences of late diagnosis learn to forgive themselves for ruining what could have been a really good thing with another person. This diagnosis journey has been a roller-coaster and I'm really looking forward to what the future may bring, but I'm finding it hard not to blame myself for unknowingly self sabotaging.",Coming to terms with an adult diagnosis and regret about ruined relationships
ADHD,"Though I get in bed at a reasonable time I can’t seem to shake off the habit of browsing on my phone till late at night.

ADHD,"I'm always mimicking the personality's around me, ya know? Playing a character per say, and its been great in a lot of cases but lately I've realized the new friends I made before the pandemic were ""bad influence's"" but the rona separated us so that's ok I guess, but I think I need to figure something else out.

I don't know how I really feel about anything. I'm very open minded and I tend to accept opinions of all sides, except for cases where I'm super opinionated for **no reason(adhd)** and I can say that because I generally don't hold the same beliefs the next day. I can usually reason both sides in my head is what I'm trying to say.

on the other hand what I might consider the real me is something I cant be. (there might be some undiagnosed problems or could be a part of adhd or even a normal human thing *I don't know*) but I've never really felt for other people, and I think selfishly, I believe that also stems from my core nihilistic beliefs, so kind of selfish in the way of ""what's the point of living if I'm not living for myself"".

ADHD,"I was so shocked and in awe at how much my highly specific shitpost ""ADHD is..."" resonated with so *many* people. I had so many people reach out to say that they were in tears because they realised that they aren't actually alone in ways they thought no one else could ever relate to.

I'm so glad that in sharing the truth about how people with ADHD actually live day-to-day, we can set each other free of how ashamed we feel about it... how entirely personal to us those struggles feel, and our need to hide/minimise them out of embarrassment.

However, I wrote the post to be a kind of in-joke and a knowing hug rather than a diagnostic tool for those who are questioning - it really is a pinch of salt sort of post. I say this because I had a lot of comments like ""now I know I definitely have ADHD"", which was making me feel a bit unnerved? I'm not qualified to tell anyone whether those behaviours/experiences definitely arise from a developmental disorder. The post doesn't define ADHD in the literal sense, but is more of a ""hey, I experience these things, and I put it down to my own ADHD"". It even spirals into the absurd, which I felt was a way of showing how I can barely define where my ADHD ""ends"" and I ""begin"", and how my ADHD symptom-spotting can become a hyper focus for me.

But if the post resonated with you, and gave you clarity on your behaviours and how you experience yourself, then that's valid in its own right - and if you want to see a psych to get a personalised assessment, absolutely by all means you should definitely do that! But please keep in mind that my post had no basis within science or psychology, and was devised from my personal experience rather than the DSM-V criteria. I really have no idea how much of what I said was about being ADHD or just being... a person?

With that being said, whoever resonated with my post - I understand how hard it is to manage living a life like this, whether it's because of ADHD, or depression, or whatever the hell it is for each of us... it's awful, and we're not alone &lt;3","My ""ADHD is..."" post"

**Chrome extensions:**

* Weava Highlighter - lets you highlight pretty much anything and it stays if you exit the page and go back on it. I find this really useful when I know my attention isn't the best, having important info highlighted in my online learning resources or in journals can help me keep track of where I am.


* TLDR - This doesn't work for all journals but it can be good if you're sitting staring at a wall of text to give you a bit of background before tackling reading it all. 


* Divider tabs - If you're anything like me when writing an essay you have about 100 tabs open all at once which can get pretty overwhelming. I use this to separate the articles I still have to read and the ones I'm going to use. 


* Sprint reader - I've only used this one occasionally but it can be good to keep your attention on reading as your brain doesn't get the chance to think about anything else as it's so focused on trying to read what's going on. 


**Other bits**


A few other things I use:


* Google home - I use this to set routines and tell me when to start work, when to take breaks, and when to get back to work, This is particularly helpful when I loose track of time on my breaks


* Tablet for notetaking - I know this isn't feeable for everyone but this year I bought a tablet and pen and have been using this to keep all my notes on. Notebooks were really overwhelming for me and stressed me out so it's been a lifesaver.


* Timelapse - I am really bad at picking up my phone and going on social media or checking messages when I'm supposed to be doing my work. I've found that making a timelapse on my phone of me doing my work helps keep me off it. I tell myself ""a 30 second timelapse is my goal"" which equates to about 30 mins work on my phone (might be different for other phones) and I don't want to spoil it so I don't touch my phone while its on. 


* To-Do list - More times than not, my brain gets something random in my head that I ""need to do right this minute"", to try and combat this I have a to-do list on my desk that I write these thoughts down on. That way I can try and tell my brain that I don't need to do it right this instant and save it for later.

ADHD,"So about 3 years ago I (28M) was fired from the job I had. Again. I've essentially been fired at every job I've ever had for being too lazy; and the one job I had the longest I got into multiple disciplinary actions for not being focused enough. I am late to work every single day. I normally just blamed it on myself for being undisciplined which just made me feel worse. I had been on Wellbutrin in college but was off and I was explaining all off my stuff and he just focused on my sever depression. Now the Wellbutrin has been an absolute life saver, I am essentially non-functioning without it.

Things that sounds like ADHD that have a very negative impact on my life/are really impulsive:

\-I've been fired or in serious trouble in every single job I have had

\-I psychically cannot use my credit card cause the second I carry I balance I can't stop impulse purchasing and ended up racking up 10k in debt (and I worked in finance I should know better but as soon as the balance got too big to pay off in full my brain was like ""fuck it what's the difference"")

\-Have made legitimate plans to drastically change my life cause I was bored and have made fully fleshed out plans to move to Amsterdam, then changed that Montreal, then changed that to New York. This was just in the span of just 6 months

\-I often forget to eat because I am hyper focused on random things. Often times on weekends when I have no schedule my first meal of the day will be between 6-8pm simply because I was so wrapped up in things.

\-I change my life long goals about once a month.

\-My mind is never quiet and I am always talking and finishing other people's sentences.

\-I hyper-focus a lot. Which is great when it's on homework. Not so great when you hyperfocus for an entire week dedicated to learning everything about how plants grow and soil erosion at the detriment of your day job.

\-Quit my job on impulse to get a graduate certificate in programming; which I also signed up for on impulse.

\-The fact I'm creating this list despite having something due at midnight that I haven't started.

But then I started looking up stories of other people with ADHD and apparently it is not uncommon for doctors to poo-poo the ADHD idea and people needing to get second or third opinions to get the right diagnosis. Apparently this can be common for women. I am just wondering if if anything I described reminds them of themselves before seeking treatment? If so how did it turn out? How did you stand firm when you were certain but you had a doctor say no cause they likely don't want to give out a controlled substance",I'm fairly certain I have ADHD but my doctor says he believe it's only depression; should I seek a second opinion
ADHD,"I’m an employed adult currently working to be referred for adhd. I’ve suffered anxiety and depression in the past and when I previously tried to express concern to my GP about ADHD they basically said ‘you’ve got a job so we can’t do much via referral’. Another issue I have is that issues like not being able to face work, procrastinating and generally being overwhelmed just gets wrote off as depression. 

And over thinking is just anxiety. I tried every anti depressant they normally use and they fucked me up bad, it took a year to feel right after one of them. 

I’m being assessed this month over the phone but I don’t even know what to say. I just feel like I’m losing myself, what I am now isn’t me and I hate it, I’m sick of feeling like my life is just a series of cycles.

ADHD,"For example, I watch a lot of videos on informative topics, such as different cultures, sciences, and because I am interested in stories, literature and film. The people I watch seem very sophisticated and intelligent (or at least their scripts sounds that way), so I was hoping that by watching them, I would pick up on their word choices, their sentence structure, and the facts they are stating. Yet, I still struggle forming sentences or writing things because I cannot translate my thoughts into words and because I can never seem to find the right words to really explain what I am thinking.         

Its a weird dissonance where I despite me seemingly learning a lot of things, I feel like I'm unable to actually put that into practice. I can watch an interesting video, but I can't explain it to another person in a way that makes sense. I can listen to people using good vocabulary, but when I try to apply it IRL, I forget what word I am trying to say. Its really weird and annoying, and I'm not sure if is because of ADHD or what.","I take in A LOT of information, whether it be from the internet, Youtube, from my classes, or from friends.

ADHD,"So I've always had problems with school because of my ADHD, but I was always able to manage. But when I started high school this year It got 10x worse. For some background this year I had a very stressful move to a new city away from all my friends I've moved over 10 times, but this one was the worst involving several contingency offers, frantic preparations and period of limbo where weren't sure if the offer was going to fall through I started school a week late In my new city and had a lot of problems catching up because of this I thought that this was the reason I was having so much trouble but It's been several months now and I don't think that that's the reason anymore. My increase in symptoms was actually the reason I sought a diagnosis And I've been on medication for a month or two My question is. Is this normal? should I be worried? I'm sort of new to this and not completely sure

edit: I realize my post might have been confusing It's been a while now since I've moved and I have settled in now but My symptoms haven't gotten any better so I think that moving might not have been the reason I was wondering If it was normal for symptoms to suddenly get worse like this",My ADHD got way worse?
ADHD,"I am a 22 year old living with my mom (starting college in a few months after a major surgery I'm supposed to have) and I have pretty severe ADHD. She recently got surgery a week ago. (Gastric bypass, she had the R and Y about 5 years ago but weight loss slowed down for her so she wanted this one to lose more.) I have a really hard time remembering as well as initiating tasks, and although I do have good days of high functioning, today was not a good day for me and I forgot to do several things. My mom almost had a mental breakdown and was on the verge of tears because there was a few dishes in the sink and a couple blankets on the laundry room floor that I had forgotten to put in the washing machine. (To give some context, I was emotionally abused/manipulated by my bio father and stepmother as a kid and more than 90% of the time when someone starts to get angry or frustrated I become very anxious and panicky.) So I got up and put the clothes in the washer and did the dishes I was supposed to do. After I was done I went into my room to calm down, and relax while she worked on her computer. I love my mom, but she hates any sort of mess and having ADHD, we clash sometimes and I can't help but feel like my worth to her is dependant on how well I can function the way she wants me to any given day. I understand that it is frustrating, and its unrealistic to expect her not to be, but about 3 hours ago she leaves the house again, on the verge of tears and says she's going out. Obviously I am concerned because she just had surgery a week ago, but before I could say something she leaves the house. She was out for an hour and a half before I finally messaged her and asked her what was wrong, to which she replies:

 ""I  think I'm pretty tolerant most of the time but I am also human and have my bad days and right now I am trying to recover from having my guts re arranged and need more help. I am exhausted to just shower. I am not expecting you to run on your own initiative. I know that's unrealistic but if you can take something out of a cupboard, you can put it back. If I have reminded you that the laundry that you put in needs to be changed, once twice and again, I think at some point you should just do that. I know you did eventually but I think it sucks that I have to.keep asking under the circumstances. I think.it sucks even more that you stomp.off into your room all day and make me feel like shit forneeding help but I guess I just have to deal with  that on my own because its the way it is. But please don't expect me to not be upset about it. That's really unfair.""

Am I unfair to be upset that she doesn't understand that this isn't something I can control? Or a bit irritated that she assumed I was angry instead of just communicating with me? Anything out of my sight is completely out of mind, and when I am hyperfocused on something I get sucked into it like a vortex. I am so tired of myself, and the way my brain works. I have tried meds and they make me feel so horrible, I feel dull and like I'm walking through quicksand the whole day until I finally reach 5pm-6pm and crash really hard. Other than forgetting the laundry and dishes, I have been as attentive as I can, and as quickly to clean as I can. My ADHD doesn't turn off because she had surgery, and I wish I could word that in a way that doesn't sound shitty.",Need some advice.

Off the top of my head I can't name them but they're some sort of stimulant the kind of drug people think you're a junkie for getting.

Anyways this is way easier than I thought it would be, are my stimulants making working out easier than it should be or did I just not lose the fitness I thought I would?

ADHD,"I am a mid 40's professional, I have spent my entire life struggling.

This year thanks to Covid I have spent a lot of time self-reflecting, I started and finished an immersion course for digital marketing. 

Part of that was spending a lot of time on social media. And a major portion of it was speaking with my peers, many of whom it turns out to have ADHD, after just a couple of days, I had some peers asking me if I had been diagnosed. 

Well, I never thought to, ADHD is not something a 40 something-year-old man has I told myself. 

So I set up an appointment with my therapist, he and I spent a couple of hours going over questions, my childhood, taking tests, etc. 

At the end he excused himself for a moment, he said after scoring the first test, out of a maximum of 100, I scored 81. He said the threshold for being considered ADHD was 46...  
And this was just the first test, he is emailing me tonight the results of the other tests as they take longer to grade and explore but having just been my therapist for a couple of years he has no doubt that ADHD is a very obvious diagnosis.

So now what?

I mean yeah it explains a lot about my life, my relationships, my childhood, my job-hopping, my imposter syndrome, the fact that I literally have done jack shit all day despite having willed myself to put socks on at least 2 dozen times (still no socks on). The best part was having an appointment for ADHD testing at noon via Zoom and not getting up out of bed until 11:54. 

So what the hell do I do now? I am grateful I have a name for this, and maybe some better insight, but how do I fix it, how to make myself a better father and spouse and actually work hard and get shit done?

ADHD,"Hi All!
I have some pretty bad ADHD. I've been on Vyvanse for 4 years and I just switched to Adderal XR 30mg, and honestly it's not what I was hoping for. I've been really tired on it. It works for about 2 hours then nothing. 

ANYWAY. 
I have some serious trouble with executive function. I'm 25 and it's somewhat embarrassing to say the least. I keep trying to organize myself and when ever I get myself organized I forget where everything is, which then turns into me destroying the space I'm in to find what I'm looking for. ( and also getting distracted by the things in the midst of trying to find it)
BUT. I remember where everything is when everything is a mess. Like I can remember where my chaotic brain put stuff when I'm disorganized. It's so hard to explain. 
Anyway if anyone can offer some tips on how they stopped living like they are on a TLC episode of hoarders that would be awesome. 

I literally can keep my spaces organized for a few days then it turns into a shit storm. Everything piles up and then I go on a chaotic cleaning spree once a month then just to ""promise myself "" I won't let it get that bad again.

ADHD,"I (F 17) have ADD. I was diagnosed when I was younger, like in 3rd grade but my mother always shut down the idea of putting me on any type of meds. She says the school tried to push her into it, and that she wasn't budging.  I always thought that this was the right choice, and that she was just being a  good mom because not being on any type of meds would help me figure things out on my  own, and she thought thought the worst about medication as my brother ended up being an addict for other reasons. Now that I think about it I never even tried it out. I think maybe things could have been different, and that I want to try them now. I'm super open to the idea, after hearing stories about how ""I tried Adderall and it changed everything"". I've always had trouble keeping up in school, conversation and basic time management, just barley scraping by but when the lockdown hit things got worse. I tried to propose the idea to my mom when things were at its lowest, and she didn't respond too kindly. She insinuated I wanted an easy way out, and said that ""You don't need medication, you need discipline"". I think if she just let up to the idea a little, I wouldn't be thinking about self-medicating in the future as I don't think she's going to change her mind anytime soon. When I so much as mention any medication that could help she gets snappy and immediately says ""You're not going on any medication"". I don't know what to do about at this point. I should mention, she gave me some Profiderall thinking it could do some good for me, so I know she's listening, but I  have to take *much* more than what's recommended on the bottle to feel any sort of small changes, and even then I barely feel any sort of focus improvement. Just more energy to make it through the day.

ADHD,"What's your relationship with games? Do you like them?

Here are the issues I run into when gaming, specifically video gaming:

1. Feeling like I'm not actually doing anything/wanting to get up and do something
2. Remembering all the rules and controls
3. Playing the game often enough that it's not a hurdle to jump back in
4. Forgetting quests/not understanding the storyline
5. Feeling overwhelmed by the amount of side quests
6. People gatekeeping gaming and making me feel like I need to play 4 hours a day or not at all. If I can only play for an hour at a time then obviously I'm just doing it to appear attractive
7. Overwhelming amount of stuff to learn about items and skills
8. Giving up at an obstacle I don't really feel like dealing with at that moment and never coming back to the game because I know the first thing I'll be doing won't be fun
9. Navigating huge menus

**TLDR: How do you get into the habit of working out, or sitting down to do some studying? How do you ""control"" your focus/willpower?** (Rewards isn't an option for me, because I don't really 'need' to study for 30 min to eat a gummy bear or work out to watch a movie, I can do both right now. In fact, I can eat the whole bag and watch movies all day.)

\- Story segment, skip if you'd like :)

I was diagnosed at 11, but only just recently rediscovered that I actually had the diagnosis. 22 now. I started medication last month. 30mg Concerta, plan on upping the dosage on next clinic visit.

I don't have many of the symptoms that others have, from what I gathered on this sub.

My memory is fairly good, unless I get distracted at the exact moment I try to make a mental note of whatever I want to remember.

My time perception isn't perfect, but it hasn't been a problem for me at work or during my personal time.

I'm fairly well off in the intelligence department, so I get a good understanding of new concepts and can come up with ideas/solutions before my neurotypical peers do. This has been very beneficial to me at work or during school when I didn't read up before class! I don't have the focus and willpower to sit down and study, however. I admire people like my girlfriend who can sit down and study for hours until she understands something. She is slower, but still makes a lot more progress than me, and that is what counts!

I remember being able to hyperfocus around the time I was diagnosed but haven't really been able to do it since.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here are the parts that I do find difficult: ""Getting my shit together"" and actually doing that one thing that I want to do.**

1)  I just moved to Japan a few months ago to be with my girlfriend. Therefore, I would like to learn her language. I have a solid language course/guide/whatever layed out with chapters etc. All very structured and 'easy' to go at.

I cannot for the life of me sit down and begin studying.

I have already studied a bit, and know some basic grammar and vocabulary. It is a lovely language and it appeals to me! I would love to learn more! I am quite motivated to become an adept/comfortable user of it. That motivation is just not enough for me to even sit down and read the title of a chapter.

2)  Working out / exercising. I have read that regular exercise is healthy for the mind, which really motivates me to do it. I'd also like to improve the look and feel of my body. 'Look' as in not seeing a skinny fat slob every time I look into a mirror. 'Feel' as in stronger back and legs, posture, more energy, etc.

I have come to the conclusion that the more important the completion/development of something is for me, the more difficult it is to do said task. It would be easy, albeit uninteresting, for me to look up Spanish lessons right now, but impossible to look up Japanese lessons.

&amp;#x200B;

**If anyone has good tips or advice on how I can go about improving this, I'd be very grateful!**

&amp;#x200B;

**In return, here is some advice from a lifestyle change that I found helpful:**

I rediscovered my diagnosis because I went to a psychologist on the suspicion that I was depressed. Her main focus area was depression and ADHD. She told me that depression symptoms were very common in ADHD patients who were under a lot of stress.

To solve that, I found that minimalism might be useful to me. I observed that all my stress was centered around information acquisition, objects, hobbies, and the social aspects they are connected to. I then read a book by Fumio Sasaki that really helped give a concrete and practical introduction to minimalism.

I have found that there are many different kinds of minimalism, many of them focus on money, consumerism, politics, rules etc. I'm not about that. I just looked around and asked myself if whatever object was something that I actually needed.

My current lifestyle is quite similar to what it was before I started to minimize parts of my life. I enjoy doing the same things, eat the same things, etc., but I am no longer stressed. ""Enjoy"" being the keyword in the previous sentence. I no longer have 'hobbies' that only give me a feeling of defeat because I always screwed up and gave up on projects, or bitterly continue because I had spent a lot of money or because I had to prove to other people etc. etc. I no longer have to spend hours cleaning and organizing or tormenting myself about the fact that I need to clean and organize or finish projects etc.

I can no longer forget anything when I leave the house. In fact, I don't even check if I have everything anymore, because everything is already in the pockets of my jacket and my bag. Jacket and bag. One of each. (Seasonal jacket change ofc).

All my 6 pairs of socks, 6 pairs of underwear, 5 t-shirts, and 3 sweaters are all sand color (Thanks army boot camp), so I never really spend any mental energy on clothing. I also store everything but socks and underwear on hangers, that way I don't have to fold anything other than underwear and socks, which is a lot easier. Throw in the wash, hang to dry, move to closet.

I simply removed everything that stressed me out instead of trying to 'cope' or 'manage'.

In the book, he calls the human brain ""50.000-year-old hardware"", and writes that a person today receives more information in one day than a person did in a year before the industrial revolution. I like keeping that in mind, as it has reduced my social media/news usage ""to stay up to date"" and my need for always seeking out new shit ""that would totally improve whatever if I can just whatever"".

Just don't turn ""decluttering"", ""minimizing"", ""frugality"", etc. into an addicting sport as some people do.

I'm a lot more relaxed now. It took about one month to go from depression with monthly anxiety/paranoia breakdowns to just feeling really relaxed and enjoying every day as it comes. I'd recommend it. YMMV though.

Brain fog also appears to be a common symptom among Long COVID patients, albeit even more severe and potentially more long-lasting.

I have to resist singing Simple Plan's ""Welcome to My Life"" every time someone complains to me about it (or to people who haven't been as sympathetic in the past to my ADHD, asking if they've just tried harder).  

As we all know, it really sucks when your brain doesn't work the way you want it to, and I hope people's issues clear up after this is all over.  I just hope that people's experiences with executive functioning problems will give them more empathy for those of us who have that as a permanent feature of their brain.",Pandemic Brain Fog = Normal ADHD Brain

**Until we can get the rest of society on the same page of understanding, we are going to be the bad guys.** We are the opposite of what everyone believes makes a good and successful person.

**We are very likely to end up in jail**. Undiagnosed people with ADHD often seek the outlet and stimulation they need to function and society isn't quite built for that.

Kind of funny but even our medication is villainized. 

Other disorders get more understanding and attention due to sympathy. You feel sad for depressed people, you agonize for Alzheimer's, you get scared for Schizophrenia.

ADHD,"I’ve always had symptoms of adhd growing up I’m now 22 but I also had other health problems so it was always kinda overshadowed but by the time I reached high school teachers, family and friends all started noticing symptoms. My school counsellor talked all the time about getting me tested but long story short my school sucked and never actually helped. I had a couple great teachers who helped me but were restricted in what they could do bc budget cuts and I still had ongoing other health problems and my dad got sick and died and a ton of other stuff was going on in my personal life so it kinda just got shoved to the back. 
I started to have hallucinations and some other issues this last year and a counsellor I was seeing for grief suspected something like schizoaffective disorder I went into the wait list and eventually saw a psychiatrist who wasn’t very helpful this was February last year she gave me quetiapine and basically disappeared i spoke to her twice and then she moved and said “I think you should still be seen so when you speak to someone next it won’t be me” she gave me no idea of when it would be or who or anything. She also didn’t diagnose me or anything and she only spoke to me on the phone for 15 minutes a couple times and then left. I tried bringing up the possibility of adhd to her but she was more focused on the hallucinations. 
I think the hallucinations have improved a lot and I’m doing pretty good in that aspect and I’m now wanting to do online university and I’m desperate to get my life back now. 
My question is my symptoms have been bothering me more and more the longer it goes without being addressed so what should I do now? I was going to wait to see if another psychiatrist is going to bother phoning me at some point to talk or make an appointment but now I don’t know if I should? I have a couple family members who are psychologists and they’re urging me to complain and try to get it addressed but I hate making a fuss, I live in the uk and the wait lists for the nhs were huge before covid and are now even longer I’m kind of scared to end up back on a long wait list I can’t really afford to go private and I don’t even know if private would be the route I should take? I was considering seeing my GP and asking what I should do but I don’t wanna bother anyone during the pandemic. I know it’s stupid but I hate wasting other people’s time.
Sorry for this long post I’m not sure if this is even the place to post I’ve just seen some super helpful people on here before and I’m just hoping for some kind of advice. Thank you so much",Looking for help with diagnosis

ADHD,"
Over the summer I was taking adderall, not sleeping enoguh, and not eating enough at all. I was in a dark place because I had to stay with abusive parents. 

I didn’t get any ideas from my brain but I got really it o researching my parents mental illness and worrying about if I had it. I stumbled upon weird sites that convinced me I was an empath but now I don’t agree with that stuff. I think my left ear started ringing and I looked up the spiritual meaning and that’s how I got into this stuff but I kept digging and genuinely believed I was an “earth angel”.  I was completely convinced that these two guys who I had previously dated in the past were also earth angels bc they both gave me the same strange smile when I was talking to them. So I was convinced that they knew things about me that I didn’t know and that they were waiting for me to find out I was an earth angel. I than thought it was my job to show other people they are earth angels and believed everyone was one just waiting to be discovered and realize what they are. I obsessively researched this for hours. 

The next morning I woke up kinda doubting it and than I joked about it to my friend and realized I was stupid and that it’s not true.

I do experience times where my ear kinda rings and I feel kinda zoned out which maybe could be slight slight disassociating 

The only thing is my BMI went down to 16 Bc I was completely depressed and just realized how abusive my parents were and how they were trying to ruin and control my life. I would get so sos o so so sickly hungry and than go to get food but I’d basically threw a fit while I was getting food bc I felt awful and starved. My parents rlly don’t buy enoguh food but I only had a fit abt it bc I was in awful condition. I was on the floor crying and historic and slammed a mug into the floor. I wasn’t completely out of control and I know that I knew the mug wouldn’t hurt anyone or myself but it was an impulsive  thing. I haven’t lost control ever other than that",Adhd meds caused mania
ADHD,"All I purchased was what I had on my list and I didn't forget anything. Little things like this just keep blowing my mind. I feel like I am becoming this version of myself I've been striving to be. 

Weird how something as simple as a successful grocery trip is making me emotional and strengthening this optimism I'm feeling about myself, my life, and my growing ability to function properly. 


I didn't make a duplicate purchase either. It's been a running joke with my husband and my mom when she lived with us. I forget my list (if I even remembered to make one in the first place) &amp; can't remember what I need and completely blank on what's in the fridge &amp; pantry at home. So I get what I think we may need. This resulted in having 4 tubs of sour cream in the fridge for about 2 months. The item I would forget we had and see at the store and think we needed would always change to. Over the course of 2-3 months, I might end up with 6 bottle of syrup or 5 jars if mayo or, at one point, *seven* spice jars of bay leaf.

My husband found it funny in a cute way. He definitely did give me actual shit about it, but I always still felt kinda dumb and too incompetent to go grocery shopping. 

So, I am also pleased to report, I didn't end up with several duplicates of the same item!

This is just 2 weeks in and the changes are making me feel so much better about myself. I feel like I have fallen unbelievably short of the mother/wife/woman I have always wanted to be, have always tried to be. But I realized I have been hitting that standard since I've been medicated.

ADHD,"Trying to improve my (35m) life in any way, meaningful or otherwise, just feels like I'm punishment myself or stealing from myself right now. I know that if I worked out, I would feel physically better, have more energy, and more happy chemicals. Hell, once I get into it, I even enjoy working out. But every time I try to get ready, it just feels like I'm taking away time from the things that I want to do now. You know, pressing matters that demand attention, like playing video games and getting scroll locked. It's not just working out. It's pretty much anything that takes effort or time. Need to get that weird scratch on the eye checked out, but man, I'd rather just go home and chill after work, especially because I have the place to myself Monday evenings. Spend an hour cooking so I don't have to think about or prepare lunch all week, sounds great, but not as good as trying to get a new high score on that level.

It just sucks. I'm medicated, and I know it's helping, a lot. I'm doing more for myself than I have been in a long time. But it feels like I am able to point myself at a task and finish it, relentless as a bulldog, but the second I punch out, any of the drive and motivation just seems to either evaporate, or it gets distilled into a self loathing, self hate fueled cleaning massacre that normally just means hauling the mess from one room to another. I hate that I can summon up almost (what feels to me like) God tier levels of focus and determination, just so long as I am not going to benefit from the work being done, but as soon as I try to work on myself, everything just feels like I'm stealing from myself and punishing myself.

When she came for me in the waiting room she started talking and asking questions but I wasn’t even paying attention at that point. I just felt the awkwardness and I said yeah, regardless of what she asked. When I stepped into her office I just exploded into words and jumped all over the place. I sort of explained that my meds were wearing off and that I wasn’t always like this so I apologised like 10 times. In the end I got my point across and she was super nice but WOW I hate myself.

ADHD,"tl;dr I am finally able to focus (thanks to meds), but still have no energy or motivation to do any of my tasks. I’m so exhausted and overwhelmed I wish the time would stop and I could just rest, without any stress or guilt. Any advice or any words at all? Thank you!

Hi, I’m a 17 year old International Baccalaureate student and i’ve been diagnosed with ADHD at the beginning of this year. I’ve started taking Medikinet and it’s been helping a lot, yet still.... i’m so damn tired all the time. I’ve been able to focus much better, but I’m too exhausted to actually do anything productive and put my new ability to focus to use. The program at school I’m taking is overwhelming, there are so many assignments, so many responsibilities and I can’t find the energy to get up and do something about it. And that makes me extremely stressed and my thoughts start racing and ruminating. I’m bullet journaling and I write down all my responsibilities and even when I see all of them and know I must do them, I’m just unable to. I’ve tried to talk with some people, but they don’t have ADHD and even though they say they understand, I never feel like they really do understand what I’m going through. They say that I should just sleep more and tbh if I could I’d sleep for a whole week and probably still would be tired. I get from 3 to 10 hours of sleep (it depends on the day), and there’s no difference in my energy levels after 3 and 10 hours of rest. So has anyone been in a similar situation and managed to do anything about it? How do you get the energy and motivation to do stuff when you finally are able to focus? How do you deal with the crippling feeling of being extremely overwhelmed?

ADHD,"Sorry if this is more suited for /r/rant, but I am the oldest brother in my family and my youngest bro has ADHD. My wife and I live with my mom and 2 younger brothers. The youngest was diagnosed with ADHD in 2019 or so, and my wife and I moved in to help my mom, who is a single mother, take care of my two younger brothers. 

The problem is that she refuses to accept any help when it comes to my brother who is suffering from ADHD. She refuses medication, which is her decision and I respect it. But she doesn't do anything else to help my brother. Doesn;t consider therapy. My brother's school gave the option, recently, for kids to go back to in-person schooling. My mom questionably says, ""It's not healthy for kid's to constantly go from Zoom schooling then back to in-person schooling"". So my brother isn't going back to school, even though my wife and I have spent a whole year supervising him at home so *we know that Zoom schooling is not the best option for him.* But my mom, and i'm going to get starkly political so be prepared, but my mom leans to the right. She's influecned by our uncle who is strictly christian conservative i.e. believes the world was created in 7 days, public schooling is brainwashing our kids to become liberal, vaccines are bad, etc. My mom doesn;t even take COVID seriously so it's not like she's holding my brother back form school due to trepidation of the virus.  

**She never thought school was bad for me and my other brother, but she thinks it's bad for our youngest brother who has ADHD.** 

Like, my wife and I can't constantly supervise my youngest brother. When he was going to school, he still struggled. however, Zoom schooling has brought his academics down even lower. He's a 5th grader at a 1st grade level. Maybe even lower. It stresses me tf out knowing that he's not getting the support he needs because my mom is stuck somewhere else. It's almost as if she's given up on my brother. She says things like, ""if he fails the 5th grade, then HE FAILS THE 5TH GRADE"" or ""If he ends up in a mental asylum, then he ends up there!"" or ""I don't think he's going to college at all"". It's like.... **don't give up on him so quickly.** He's not an idiot, he just has trouble focusing. IT'S OUR RESPONSIBLITY TO GIVE HIM THE SUPPORT HE NEEDS, whether that's medication or therapy or simply sending him back to school. 

My mom has been a single mother for a long time. She's gone through the wringer. She's gone through so much shit and I love her for being so strong. But we need more right now. All my brother cares about is his dumb YouTube videos (I fucking hate FV family or whatever the fuck it's called) and video games. No sense of urgency or responsiblity. I **hate** getting frusttrated, yelling at him, pounding the table. I wanna see him succeed. I wanna se him be able to understand how money works. I wanna see him understand how to act. Because if not, he's gonna get shit on in the real world. 

My mom constantly makes me feel bad for trying to discipline him i.e. do chores and shit. But I'm just trying to teach him responsiblity and shit. 

I'm drunk, and there's more to what I've posted. I just can't reliably get it all out. I'm just so sad, frustrated, stressed, and depressed thikning about my brother and how it feels like my mom has sorta given up on him. She doesn't put him in the best position to succeed, and when I try to do it, she chastises me and makes me feel like im some dictator or something. I just wanna see my brother succeed. I don't want to see him struggle with kindergaden math. 

Not only that, but the quarantine and pandemic makes me and my wife feel even more lonely about our situation. I don't think my mom has told many poeple in our famly about my brother's ADHD, and I think that hurts us. There are solutions, but my mom thinks continuing the same ""Oh, you didn't turn in your homework this month? NO GAMES AND TV FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR...."" then a week later, he's still playing games and watching YouTube. 

Of course, I can talk to my mom, but the task is daunting. Daunting because no mom likes to be told they're doing things wrong, especially from their own child. 

Again, just a rant. I fucking hate getting frustrated at my brother when doing homework. I hate yelling at him, I hate pounding the table out of frustration, I hate seeing him struggle with simple math, I hate seeing him cry over school. WE NEED PROFESSIONAL HELP AND MY MOM ISN'T GETTING IT. 

I love ya'll. I love that there's a community like this. It makes me feel less alone. I am just at my wit's end. I don't know how to approach this. Like, I've meticulously practiced what I would say to my mom. I;ve made sure not to offend her. I've made sure to watch my words. But the actual act of telling her fills me with anxiety, and then depression. It's debilitating. It feels like my mom has given up on my youngest brother.

ADHD,"I’m medicated and been diagnosed for the last 16 years since late teens. 

I started a job 6 months ago where they told me all training provided but threw me in the deep end with more work than what is possible in the hours I have, and provided a 3 day handover but it only covered basics and not any of the extra things I’m asked. 

Only the owner of the small business usually knows specific answers to questions about equipment issues (my job is managing scientific instrument returns from hire) and some things will maybe be another person in the office. 

Anyway my manager took my aside to ‘see how I was going’ and I replied honestly that I was stressed about the increasing workload and the expectations to do things I wasn’t trained for (regulatory and licensing stuff).

However I don’t know how I feel about this conversation as she proceeded to tell me that she could see I was stressed and that I’m too loud in the open plan office (sighing or responding verbally to a bad email ‘nooo, you’re kidding!’ Echoes through the office from the back wall where I’m in a corner. She said others see me like this and they stress out. 
Also she said to phrase my questions to the boss (only person who can help most of the time) in a way that have solutions already so the boss isn’t troubled, and also try and ask the other woman more often. So far this is okay I guess it’s constructive criticism.

But:  the part making me feel awful is that she then said
“And the boss has taken the last few days off for stress leave, mainly due to service department”.
Which I take as them blaming me for someone else’s stress. 
I suggested I change hours from 3 short days to 2 long ones (I feel I’ll be more productive) which was shot down.
Then she said “so if you need anything...”
I was like, yeah I’m stressed...
Then nothing much just a chat about what’s due this week.

I left feeling completely awful like she didn’t offer solutions to reduce workload just basically told me to stop asking questions / stop being stressed and that I caused my boss’s stress leave.

My psychiatrist has said last week when I saw him that I should quit that the environment isn’t right.

ADHD,"My wonderful best friend has ADHD and is trying to mange cooking and housework. She needs lists/trackers for external accountability, and the reward boost. But also gets bored or rebellious (her words not mine) of her lists. So she rotates frequently between downloadable task PDF's but they have a lot that she doesn't care about or stress her out in other ways. I'm trying to help come up with a ADHD friendly system to keep track of daily, weekly and monthly chores.

My idea was to have a jar with tasks for each of those categories so she pulls one out and can have the boost of seeing it in a ""completed"" jar. Also she doesn't know what she is going to be doing so it keeps things changing frequently. I'm wondering if the big monthly ones should have a playlist link on it and a reward jar that she can pick a fun thing from after it's done. Also she will probably swap out ones she really doesn't want to do that day so hopefully by the end of a month we will know which are the hardest most dreaded tasks for her and figure out if me or her SO can help pitch in with those in some way.

ADHD,"Hey everyone, I'm a 21F currently in my junior year of college. My academic journey has been rough, horrible grades in school and got diagnosed with ADHD in 5th grade. Instead of getting me help, my immigrant parents pulled me out of school and home schooled me with no knowledge of what an ADHD kid needs. Basically lost 3 years of school until I begged them to send me back and they finally agreed, except for some reason they faked home school records and got me placed in honors level courses? I ended up failing my classes, moved down levels, and barely graduated.

I have my associates degree in computer science (always had the passion for it, but didn't think I was smart enough) and am now at a 4 year college, things are much better.

ADHD,"I have noticed that I constantly think about the present. The past and future doesn't matter. Only the present. I think anyone with ADHD can relate... 

Let's change that! 

Do you have a list of endless stuff to do? Great! Let's create some buckets for it.

Ask yourself: do you need to complete this task today? Right NOW? Do you really need to organize your sock drawer now? Really? Or is your anxiety high due to the tasks you are avoiding and you are suppressing those feelings by doing other things instead? 

Once you have prioritized your tasks, put the top 3-5 tasks on your DAILY list and leave the other ones behind. Ignore them. Don't even look at them. Put them on a separate list and keep them away from your mind.

Tackle the daily list first. End of the day, reassess your daily list- what did you complete? Everything? Half of it? Or only a few things? Was it due to lack of time or lack of motivation? Either way... award yourself for making progress! If you didn't complete everything, that's OKAY! Be proud of what you've accomplished and move the other items to the next day if needed. 

Once you have completed everything on your top 3-5 task list, then you can visit your master list and pick your new top daily task lists to complete. 

Tomorrow will always be there! Do your best! If you are having a bad day, take a break and do something else if you can! Don't be hard on yourself! Minimize the clutter in your head by writing everything down, prioritize your list of things you want to do, and begin working on that list one day at the time. Let's be real, that list grows every day too! However, using our time as we desire is important for our mental health and planning ahead of time can help minimize our anxiety. 

Hope this helps someone! It sure helped me. I am not consistent but it's a good foundation to create good habits by minimizing the clutter in our heads and not just in our homes!",Stop beating yourself up. There is always tomorrow.

They go onto the next and I'm like ""crap, I already forgot the first instruction"" and then they keep going on and on, but I am freaking out because they keep listing things and even if I miraculously start to remember the later steps, it wouldn't matter since I can't even remember the beginning steps. 

I hate it. It reminds me of when I try to remember numbers or certain things and I have to constantly repeat it to myself because if I get distracted it will go away and if I don't repeat it, I will definitely forget.

ADHD,"The hyperactivity is always worst when I have to sit down and do schoolwork. I am going to fail this midterm because I couldn't sit still and focus for long enough to do half the homework and I can not sit still and stare at a computer to write the exam. I need to run. I am 19. Most people's hyperactivity seems to have lessened by this age, or at least they have learned to deal with it, but mine is just as bad as when I was a kid, and now it is less socially acceptable to be moving around constantly. Wiggling in class does not work, I just want to walk like 3 miles! I cant focus on anything while sitting still, the urge to move is so strong. I have extra time for this midterm, and I still do not know if I will be able to do it. And then I have to write an essay that I was supposed to start last week but could not because I had the brain fog. I just want, no, not want, NEED, to be moving constantly, but I have to sit still for like 80 percent of the day.

ADHD,"My ADHD diagnosis is a relatively new thing for me, and I'm still figuring out what works. One of the funniest things I've noticed so far is that I have a pretty distinct 2-3 hour window in my day when the Vyvanse really has me in a good, productive mood -- but I'm rarely doing any of the stuff that's most pressing. 

For me, I find myself writing job applications like a motherfucker. Obviously this isn't a bad thing, and to an extent I'm glad I do it because it's something I find very tedious, boring, and even discouraging when I'm not on the meds; but as full-time student who's also balancing a volunteer role, needless to say I have a lot of other things that should take priority.

ADHD,"So basically my neuropsychologist assessment showed a lot of overlap to ADHD symptoms. The doctor said he doesn’t want to take that diagnosis off the table, but first wants to address my “honestly quite severe anxiety disorder”. 

He said we need to approach my meds way differently to focus on my anxiety and less on my depression. I’m on the max dose of Wellbutrin XL, 30mg of Buspiron, and 200mg of Zoloft. So idk what’s next yet, more on Thursday. 

I’m just hoping whatever medication changes are made that I can manage them alright. I’m tired of adjusting. But if this is what will help then 🤷🏻‍♀️

Also, my home actually gets a bit cleaner! To use it, just open a PDF in Edge (literally the only thing I use it for) and near the top there is a button that says ""Read Aloud"". You can even choose different voices and different languages!

ADHD,"TLDR: At 35 y.o., my first visit to a psychiatrist was filled with him talking a lot about himself, interrupting me, and being a terrible listener. I left without a diagnosis and was prescribed Adderall. Not sure what to do with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 35 year old male who scheduled my first ever psychiatrist visit after months of researching ADHD and wondering if I have it.

To start, I was asked to fill out an Adult ADHD Assessment, which is the first Google Image result when searching 'adult adhd test.' Below are a couple of highlights from our session.

He began by asking about my background and history, which seemed normal enough, but then he began interrupting me at various points when I didn't give an answer that he found sufficient. For example, he asked me questions about my business sales, but because I didn't give him a one sentence answer, he said that I was refusing to answer the question. Then he went on a monologue about the things he did when opening his own practice (I didn't know I was attending a business seminar). He made sure to highlight how much better he was at running a business, even though I hadn't really told him that much about mine. I had to interrupt him at one point and ask, ""what's the point?"" Otherwise, he would've kept going.

I have always struggled with my weight, but have it under control these days with a good plan in place. I've had success losing and keeping weight off in the past, but gained it back when I got busy with my business. He suggested bariatric surgery at one point, and I said that wasn't an option. He brought it up again multiple times throughout our session, even though I was direct in saying 'no.' It was bizarre.

At one point he told me ""if you don't have ADHD, then you have something weird."" I couldn't believe how unprofessional that was. It felt like I knew more about ADHD than he did. 

At the end, he prescribed me Adderall and went on a rant about the similarities and differences between Adderall and meth. I zoned out here because I was tired of listening to him. 

Has anyone else experienced something similar? Should I get a second opinion? I have a hard time trusting this guy. Should I be concerned about starting Adderall if I don't really need it?","Condescending Psychiatrist: ""if you don't have ADHD, then you have something weird"""

I called a specialty clinic at a hospital here in Boston and the intake guy was hell bent on diverting me, then when I finally won the argument that I was eligible to be seen there my appointment isn't until literally next year.

ADHD,"Ive been on vyvanse for over a year at 40mg. Its been fine, I get normal side effects (irritability, trouble sleeping) but nothing terrible. This last month I picked up my meds and since the first day of taking them I felt super weird. I was sure to drink lots of water and eat food but I still felt dizzy, nauseous and my brain felt like scrambled eggs. 
    After a few days of going through that I stopped taking them everyday and would only take it if I had a test or lots of hw. Last week I took them everyday because of midterms but on the friday of that week it went horribly wrong. I have never felt so bad,hella dizzy, vision would go black whenever I stood up, couldnt walk very far without falling to the ground, and I threw up for hours and couldn’t get myself off the bathroom floor. This started right after it got into my system (1-2hrs after taking). I also lost feeling in my feet and my hands and feet were purple. I took my temp because I was freaked out with how cold I was and my temp was 96 deg. I thought it was just a fluke but yesterday I took another pill and it wasnt nearly as horrible but still dizzy, very nauseous, black vision when standing up and brain feeling very confused. Today I took one of my leftover vyvanses from last month (same mg) and I feel normal??

ADHD,"Anyone else prescribed medication for their ADHD to take daily (I'm taking Vyvanse), but often experience withdrawal in between prescriptions? 

My pharmacy will not fill my prescription until 30 days after my previous one was filled, so essentially I get my refill when I run out of pills. If the pharmacy is out of stock on my medication, or the doctor forgot to call it in this month, I'll end up having to go between a few days and a few weeks without my medication. And because I take it daily for a month, this ends up giving me withdrawals during that period. Then when I start taking it again, my body spends an equal amount of time ""adjusting"" to it.

This cycle sucks and I don't know how I can avoid these withdrawal periods. I could stockpile pills for events like this, but technically that would be breaking my controlled substance contract. What can I do?",Withdrawal between prescriptions
ADHD,"I know people swear by accountability to help them follow through on tasks and goals but it gives me the opposite effect. I feel like if there is an outside expectation to do something, the more prevalent that expectation is, the less likely I’ll do it. It comes with a feeling of not wanting to have my freedom infringed upon. This is why I decided that I need to go into business for myself. I am also not good at taking advice even if it came from the most successful person. If they don’t understand adhd then their advice means almost nothing to me. I don’t know if I’m being close minded that way. I don’t want to fix this trait of mine I’m actually trying to find the positive in this. I don’t completely write off people, I will accept help if I believe I really need it. But most of the time I don’t want the help because it’s not actually helpful to me.

ADHD,"I'm a 21 year old female, just diagnosed with ADHD a week ago (though I'd be suspecting it for a long while), I started on Vyvanse the same day as my diagnosis and my doctor (she's awesome) is really confident that its the right diagnosis and that 40mg will likely be a good dose for me. She started me on 20mg this week, then 30mg next week, then up to 40mg and then we have a follow up.

The first day of 20mg I felt like I was wearing glasses for the first time, it was amazing. I still feel like that, clear, focused, but I've noticed that it seems to wear off around 1pm (I'm taking it at about 8am) and for me this has meant feeling dizzy and headachy and yeah. I basically get amazing work done in the mornings and in the afternoon I can't even read a paragraph without getting a headache and I just cant focus on the words enough to absorb them? if that makes sense? its really uncomfortable and I can't get work done. I need to get work done because I'm a 4th year undergrad and about to graduate and keep my grades up for grad school.

I know that its probably that the dose is just too low, I tend to metabolize drugs like anesthetics really quickly, or so my dentist has told me lol - apparently its a redhead thing? (I don't buy it but whatever)

Anyway, I want to stay on the Vyvanse because it helps me A LOT and before I was on it I was really struggling. I guess I'm just wondering: Will this crash go away as I'm getting used to the stimulant? will it go away will a heavier dose? if it doesn't go away, does anyone have any tips for managing the crash?

I'm obviously really new to this whole community so if there is anything that you would tell your 'just diagnosed' self if you could, I'd love to hear it! I really appreciate any advice!

- I can’t understand what I’m feeling a lot of the time and repress all anger and frustration and turn it onto myself; there is a massive lag between upsetting and traumatic events and my emotional response, sometimes weeks, sometimes even years
- In a romantic relationship, I actually just felt myself go insane- I alternated between obsession and repulsion. I repeatedly broke up with my ex only to beg for him back days later. I lied and I cheated and yet whenever things ended, I was convinced that I wanted to marry him. 
- when he ended it with me, I lost all control over myself, said and did very manipulative things, and couldn’t function properly for months 
- I am always hyper fixated on one person, from whom I derive all my validation and sense of self
- I’ve only contemplated suicide once, and I have never physically self harmed, which seems inconsistent with BPD.

ADHD,"So the storyline started cool, like she has adhd and takes medication for it and thats kind of that. But then it develops into an addiction plot and she gets sent to rehab.... The way she’s supposedly abusing the meds is the way I imagine you would pop opioids and sedatives. She’s fishing out the bottle at random stressful times or when she feels a craving and it’s more and more frequent. And the behaviour she is displaying because of the Adderall is how I’d expect someone who ISNT medicated to act. And then she goes to rehab and blah blah and comes back to her job and does great and makes good decisions and is focused. Without medication and the pain in her leg from an accident is what is keeping her focused apparently... so she behaves un medicated on medication and medicated and like she’s coping (and a little aggitated, but honestly my medication gives me a bit of a short fuse sometimes so she still seems medicated to me.).

I've been diagnosed with anxiety before and have had terrible luck with antidepressants. Sure I feel calm but I'd be zombie tired all the time. They also started to cause ed and low libido which for a 27 year old male is quite embarrassing. I always misunderstood adhd and when I finally started looking into it I truly believe the anxiety I feel is a side effect of adhd.

ADHD," I've been plagued with suicidal ideation for many months now, a constant annoying thought that resides in my head. Quarantine hasn't made it any better. A few weeks ago, after crying for about 3 hours, I decided to make a noose out of my charging cable. Why? I don't know, I wasn't going to kill myself, maybe I just wanted to feel it on my neck. 

That's not the point here, though. After I tied the noose, I was quite impressed with my skills. It was a damn good knot. So for about 2 hours after that I just researched various knots and perfected them.

Hey guys,
I just got prescribed adderall after being two years on Ritalin and Concerta.
I am in engineering school and am going to keep taking these stimulants on days that I study in (I have two-three days a week that I promised myself not to take anything).

ADHD,"I'm looking for a book about ADHD, with 2 main concerns: 

1. Addressing the evidence related to AHDH

2. Being relatively up to date (3-5 years old?)

I've searched a bit for books around ADHD, including this sub, but most are for a general audience that barely know what ADHD is. I'm looking for something more textbook-like that actually discusses research.

Thanks!",Science-based books about ADHD?
ADHD,"To give a little background - I always had felt that something is wrong with my brain but I accepted the fact ""this is the way I am.""

Meantime I have developed ""systems"" that made me productive and being able to function. I am working in the digital marketing field - so the work is mainly mental. I have become really good at my profession - mainly thanks to coffee. But while being stimulated I knew that my brain is working at 3% and my potential is so much bigger but I had turned down many opportunities.

After years of drinking 4-5 cups of coffee I have developed problems with anxiety and not being able to concentrate while on caffeine (8 months ago)  - I had to quit it. In this time I really pushed myself to do the work but every day was harder and harder.

My ability to work had gone down to the point I had to go to the doctor since I didn't know why I can't focus anymore. I also took time off work.

I have been diagnosed with ""mental burnout"" due to my constant pushing in the last 8 months. While the doctor diagnosed me with ADHD (initiative) and told me to go to the psychiatrist.

I have started with Strattera 4 days ago while being diagnosed with ADHD at 29 years old. While I know that Strattera takes some time to work - but it's kind of weird.  I feel very low -  I am unable to speak, think, focus while on the Strattera. Like in ""zombie"" mode 24/7.

Yesterday I was like ""f\*\*\* it"" - and drank some coffee. Immediately I have become ""woken up"" to the point where I could do some focused work for one hour.

At the moment I am drinking my 3rd coffee today and I have no problem writing this post. Every time that coffee wears down - I enter ""zombie"" mode again and leaves me that jittery feeling.

It looks like my brain needs to be stimulated. While the original plan from my psychiatrist was - we will try Strattera and then Wellbutrin since with Ritalin there is a possibility for addiction.

Also, in her words - Ritalin is prescribed only for ""hardcore"" ADHD examples. Currently, in my country - the only available medications for ADHD are Ritalin or Strattera. Nothing else.

I feel like my brain needs something to be stimulated with. Is this normal? In 4 days I have a checkup call with my psychiatrist.

Could be beneficial for me to try Ritalin since all my life the coffee was the only thing that helped me?

I really don't want to create a ""self diagnose"" but from knowing my body and how I function - I really don't want to be put on antidepressants like Wellbutrin.

I feel really down currently - since I absolutely love to work, but in this condition being unable to perform any mental task I will have to change my career if I don't find something that will help me.",Started with Strattera - but only caffeine helps me (BIG TIME)
ADHD,Does going from 2 mg to 4 mg make much of a difference? Does the fatigue go away? Is weight gain guaranteed? I am on Wellbutrin XL and 2 mg of Intuniv. I can’t take stimulants so I’m rather limited in my medication choices. I’m concerned about the side effects of weight gain and fatigue so I’m reluctant to take more but if it makes that much of a difference then the risk is worth it. I sleep 12 hours a day already from my other medications and have constant fatigue and I’m finally losing the weight I gained from mood stabilizers so these side effects are very undesirable. But if I could actually study without making an Olympian effort it would be worth it.,Does Intuniv work that well?

I’m depressed and hate my job. I started waking up at 6 am naturally on the weekends and sleeping late and not get enough sleep just to maximize the time away from work, I’m not doing so well fellas.

Not sure how to overcome this and I'm too paralyzed by anxiety to truly enjoy my time away from work 

Feel like I'm becoming an NPC 

Is this all there is to life. Now I know why my teen angst was so bad when it was... I was dreading all of this and I had a right to.

Sometimes I cry and want to be a teenager again. it feels like for my entire life everyone has been in a hurry to grow up and at every stage, every milestone of life, I just long for the past and wish we could just slow the fuck down for one second. When all my peers have engaged and taken on the challenge of growing older I feel like I have always been one step behind. Is this an ADHD thing? Really, it worsens my feelings of alienation. I vividly remember getting bullied for being 12 and still acting like it, it felt like my peers were interested in dating and social politics and I was still acting like a pure child, just prioritizing fun and being authentic and still doing ""immature"" things. 

Maybe not enough of my friends are going through 20s angst like I am. I've started going through it when I turned 22 and it hasn't stopped since -- I mean, I feel like I haven't been able to catch a breath and enjoy life without losing my mind and anxiety on overdrive, like I'm running out of time to form my identity, to find my career, etc. 

How can someone as immature and childish as me and whimsical gain satisfaction from growing up and doing grown-up things? btw I'm 23 and turning 24 this year and I've felt like garbage just thinking about it. My anxiety is so bad, I can't even go a day without thinking how I'm one day closer to aging and dreading the depression from that. It's like each birthday gets worse and worse.

ADHD,"So...

I picked up circuitry and arduino stuff as a hobby my senior year of highschool, so I went to UTD for Electrical Engineering. 

Little did I know I would absolutely DREAD the core classes I had to take, and ended up getting a D in US history, a C+ in Calc III, an F in some stupid intro to college course that made us do STUPID little projects and a C in chemistry.

HOWEVER I got an A in Computer Science and an A+ and a 100 on my final for Intro to electrical engineering, classes I actually liked.

That was first semester. Second semester I ended up falling in a depression pit and stopped going to classes, it was too much, I hated it.

So I dropped out of college. My brother graduated from college and decides to move to New Mexico and invited me to move in with him. I say sure why not it would be nice to get away and see my cousins who live in ABQ.

That plan goes terribly, I could either never find a job there (because I didn’t try hard enough) or I didn’t hold a job for very long because I couldn’t wake up on time. I was never able to pay a single month of rent out of the 6 months I was there and my mom had to help pay for it, I felt like a spoiled piece of shit.

I move back to where I live and I decide that I want to go to school for music composition, I’m actually a pretty good musician if I don’t say so myself, I knew that if I could put in the work that I could actually make it as a music producer or recording engineer or even a jazz pianist.

But I couldn’t put in the work, as much as I said to myself that music is my passion, deep down I knew that I wasn’t as obsessed as other successful music producers, I wasn’t the same level of obsessed in music as I was to rocket league in which I have 2,000 hours logged. With rocket league i was OBSESSED with getting better, now I am top 1% of players in that game. If only I had the motivation to be top 1% of musicians haha. I just think music is really cool but I’m not obsessed. I ended up dropping out of music school, but I still learned a lot from it. I went to music school for a year and dropped out right when Covid started.

For the first 5 months of Covid I just hermited hardcore at my parents place. My parents have been suggesting I get a job but Im like “ehhhhhhhhhhhhh yea I’ll try”, but I just procrastinate and end up not getting a job. Pretty sure this is depression, I can’t find an inch of motivation to find a simple job.

I turned 21 in July and start going to clubs and end up catching Covid, I quarantined in my room and somehow didn’t give it to my parents. I actually made a lot of connections through clubbing, I found out about underground warehouse raves and got paid DJ gigs occasionally from networking. I knew DJing wasn’t enough though, and I wasn’t grinding music producing everyday.

My friend on discord one day decides that he’s going to drop out of college and become a self taught web developer. I was like “oh that’s cool my moms a web developer so I actually know the basics”. He shows me his website and the design is absolute garbage lol, it looks like a 2005 website. I show him how to make it look more modern and show him ways to organize his code. He says “bro we should learn this together”. I think yea this could actually give me direction. I make a basic website for myself, but then I’m like “hmm now what, I guess I’ll play some rocket league or something”

My dad notices that I was interested in web development and said that I could do devmountain.com a web dev course that’s 9am to 5pm for 13 weeks.

I’m like holy shit this is it

This is what I’ve been needing

Something that can give me DEFINITIVE STEPS on what I need to learn to become a web developer

No bullshit core classes, just straight coding, something I actually LIKE.

I can’t stop thinking about what life what be like earning 70k a year and being able to afford things and not feel like a bum.

This course is giving me hope that I’ve never felt before

I told my mom to wake me up at 8am every weekday and shove an adderall down my throat to make me wake up (this works).

I start April and I am hoping that I have what it takes to do this course, and I feel like the pressure that my parents are paying $7700 for this course will motivate me for sure, I also told ALL of my friends that I’m going to complete this course and that I will be making big money soon.

ADHD,"I've been diagnosed for about two years now, and since then have tried at least a dozen different medication varieties, but so far none have had any real significant affect on me as far as I can tell.

As of now, I've gone back to 40mg of instant-release Adderall, and every so often I'll notice it a little but not very often. Meanwhile though my sister and mother who both have extremely similar issues that I do (I'd bet the farm they both have undiagnosed ADHD as well) have tried doses as low as 5mg and had exceptional results. 
I'm happy for them, of course! It's just baffling to me because I've been putting in the work for 2+ years to try and nail down what I'm doing wrong, and this just further confuses me. We have similar genetics, identical lifestyles and eating habits, but somehow I get less benefits from 8x the doses they need.

Have any of you had problems similarly to this before? I'd just really like to know what else I could try looking into.

If it matters: I've tried plenty of behavioral adjustments and organization systems, I go to therapy regularly both individual and ADHD-specific groups, and exercise and sleep decently. I have anxiety issues and depression, but I deal with those with my therapist. I take my vitamins, eat my veggies, and get good amounts of sunlight too.
As far as medications go I've tried: Stratterra, Adderall IR and XR, Ritalin, Concerta, Bupropion, Focalin, Gabapentin, Lexapro, Vyvanse, Abilify, Wellbutrin and many more at many doses. Some had *maybe* a subtle effect but never anything substantial or consistent. (I didn't even notice side effects for any of them either, so couldn't even really tell if they were working at all, haha).

(If it matters I have GERD as well for many years, which I've only recently begun treating. if that could be a factor in medication effectiveness, I thought I'd mention.)

TL/DR: I've tried a whole drug store's worth of medications which I'm not even sure did a thing to me, while relatives who are similar to me in almost every way are having great results from the very same stuff I've tried.

ADHD,"I have been diagnosed with ADHD+Autism (and some other stuff, woot!) since I was a young kid, but have never been properly medicated. I tried Concerta when I was young but couldn't remember it, leading to issues later in my adult life.

I have basically been on a WHOLE bunch of antidepressants from my GP, and have never had an adult psychiatrist. Once I hit 18 I was basically lost to the system. 

Cue this year: 

After a bunch of trauma, trying to get psych help, and continually being basically denied, I finally got a psychiatrist, he didn't ask many questions, I never got enough time to describe all my symptoms and history so he tried to put me on prozac to no avail, so I asked about ADHD and he ended up giving me Concerta (for the second time in my life). I took it for a few days but felt like I was dying with heart palpitations and panic attacks, I felt horrible and stopped taking them, calling him as soon as I could. 

Due to all sorts of traumatic events, I moved house twice while with this doctor and the next time I called, he basically wrote a list of recommended meds to give to my GP and then dropped me due to location (due to covid, I had never met him in person, only spoke over the phone, so this was confusing) 

Now I'm on Vyvanse for the first time with possible euphoria and very mildly elevated BP and HR headaches every evening and no psychiatrist. Due to past crappy meds really messing with my brain, I have been worried and panicking every morning when I'm not on the meds, but this seems to go away when I take them (which worsens my fears for euphoria, or even mania?!)

Does anyone else have fear and anxiety on new meds? Has anyone else basically been lost in the psych system?

The one thing I am struggling with / slightly confused about, however, is although I relate more to the inattentive type of ADHD, one thing that does stick out is how disruptive I was at school. I was the ‘class clown’ and would constantly be talking and joking and arguing with the teachers, traits which I feel I have carried with to adult life as I regularly get told at work I can talk too much (although i’m good at my job so they dont really highlight it much). 

The disruptive trait, along with not being able to shut up or wait my turn to talk is the main thing I resonate with from the Hyperactive category. 

I have a LOT of problems with executive dysfunction too. 

My main question I guess, is this more factors of combined ADHD? I can barely find any info on the combined type!

I’m a lot more talkative and find it hard to stop talking and not bug everyone around me when i’m at work, but in social settings i have trained myself to take the backseat in fear of not being listened to.

ADHD,"TL;DR: From GP call to consultation with NHS Psychiatrist in less than a month.

Hey all, I have some ""behaviours"" that I believe could be symptoms of ADHD, but I was always able to pretend all was fine by compensating with hyper-focus (which is EXHAUSTIVE!) . This wasn't so much of a problem at school when things were simple and easy, but became progressively harder when I started Uni and even worst as I advanced in my career. 

Anyways, my case isn't the point here. 

About three weeks ago I decided to look for help. I called my GP to inform them I wanted to see a psychiatrist privately, but would like to know if they could write the prescriptions (if it came to that). I didn't even consider getting in the NHS waiting line as I heard horror stories of 3-5 years waiting times.

My GP immediately stopped me and said ""you know, we have an amazing psychiatry team available and I would really prefer you going to them, who I know and trust"". He told me they run triage sessions every week so I would know if I was included in the waiting list or not in 1-2 weeks. I saw no harm in trying but didn't keep my hopes up. 

A bit more than a week later I get a letter saying that I was included in the waiting list (dated a three days after the call) and a couple of days after that, a call from the psychiatrist's office asking if I could attend a video appointment in two weeks. 

It took less than a month between the first call with the GP to the date of the first appointment with psychiatrist! 

I am absolutely over the moon! 

Now, I am aware this is probably not the same for all the NHS regions but if you are being put off to call your GP because you think it will be pointless, do it! CALL THEM! Talk to them and ask how often they triage the cases. Make notes before the appointment and explain how that affects your life.

ADHD,"sorry this is like my third post tonight, im having bad insomnia and i just found out that this sub exists and holy shit am i over the moon about it.

i want to start medication for my adhd again because im going to college in the fall. i got put on vyvanse my freshman year of high school and i stopped taking them when the pandemic started (march of my junior year). ive been managing fine without them my senior year so far, but im worried that college might be different. i need a new medication though, because vyvanse made me feel all around horrendous and made my anxiety increase so much that i had to start wellbutrin XL. my heart rate increased drastically and i felt like a walking zombie, so vyvanse is a definite no from me. 

does anyone here have severe anxiety and a medication that actually works for their adhd without messing with it? if so please leave your recommendations down below, im desperate to try something new that might actually work. 

thank you in advance &lt;3",im thinking of starting adhd medication again.
ADHD,"I've been on atomoxetine for two weeks now, after being taken off wellbutrin since it gave me a seizure after a stressful phone call about my mental health. I've been on methylphenidate and Adderall in the past and they both ground me down over time until I was miserable or high or both basically all of the time. 

It's been nearly two weeks since stopping wellbutrin and I find myself feeling things more, I feel less empty and I forget things less, but I've been having a lot of difficulty with basic tasks like feeding myself, cleaning, or even finding interest in things I know I like. 

Will this get better? I've heard that atomoxetine takes a few weeks for the effects to be fully felt. I like having emotions but it seems like the bad ones outnumber the good.

ADHD,"I’m so so so tired of stupid little mistakes.

My work recently went through stints of 7 days straight working followed by 7 days off. (Covid) Even with meds my brain was so tired it wouldn’t pick up on little things at the end of day checks leading to mistakes. So boss agreed a reasonable accommodation for this is that my colleague would do checks on the Sundays and I would focus on other end of day tasks. 

Recently we went back to normal schedule which included weekend cover. So most weeks mon to Friday but occasionally mon-sun followed by a shorter wed-Friday week to cover weekend.  I would be in on my own over the weekend during my 7 days as that’s the way we work. I felt sick with nerves but took my time to do the checks and left feel anxious but confident I’d done the best I could. 

I’m off for two days but just got a message from colleague at work that a lid wasn’t wedged on properly. The type of containers in my line of work don’t have clicks or seals and the lids are made by us out of Perspex. When you put them on top it’s mostly just to stop stuff dropping down. For a few of them however it’s expected we wedge them down for safe measure. Which I usually do as I’m scared of fucking up. 

Yesterday the lid in question was on top and nothing poked out the side but it wasn’t wedged down.  So when I checked at end of day my brain went yeah the lids are on. Now some bad stuff has happened to stock overnight. Normally if it wasn’t wedged on it would all be okay, but last night it wasn’t wedged and the fluke chance ,just in case, stuff happened. Some stock is spoiled and I feel sick. 

I’m panicking as I’m already staring down the barrel of a competency review. I’m trying so hard to stop this stuff from happening. I never make the same mistake twice but it’s so hard to know when what I’m perceiving is adhd brain filling in gaps or actually there. This is my dream job and I work so hard and do well in other areas of the work. But the kind of job I’m in these mistakes just can’t happen and my contract includes working weekends so I can’t avoid them. 

I just feel so broken and knotted up inside. I’m dreading going in Wednesday. My boss hasn’t messaged anything which either means it’s fine and will be marked as an everyone remember to double check (as I’m not the only one) or their waiting for me to finish my days off as I’ll be pulled aside for another reprimand and potentially the competency review as it’s yet another mistake from Grey.

I just want to stop being broken. I try so hard and take on what people say. I always take precautions and into account my stupid brain so big mistakes never happen but this little stuff. The small don’t even have to think about kind of everyday stuff that everyone else does without thinking is what I fuck up.

This is also just for literally doing the smallest things in life like getting up on time, making my bed, hygiene. My internal motivation is not reliable and I eventually lose motivation, if someone else held me accountable, or some external thing is giving me structure I am just fine, (ex. I can work 11 hour shifts no problem, as I am not responsible for any of the structure, it’s already there).

ADHD,"I am at that point in my life where it feels like the mental walls inside my head are seeping into my skull. I'm a 26 year old college drop-out with no skill set, no direction, and no hope. Currently unemployed, I have no one to blame other then myself and my decision making abilities. It seems as if for the past five years every single day I've made the wrong decision; and every morning wake up in the same exact position I was in the day before. 

This routine has been my life ever since I dropped out of college.  I'm aware that my job resume will never match my actual qualifications. However, I'm also aware that when I have a reason to get up and go get it every single day, I don't ponder about the facts of my life as much. I have a loving family, two wonderful parents, and a world of opportunity in front of me. 

At age 26, I have six more months until I am off my parent's health insurance. An aspect that unfortunately plays a massive role in my life thanks to my ADHD. It seems as if i have two choices: 

1. Find a union job/ sell my soul to the City
2. Attempt to get off my medication by the time age 27 comes around

ADHD,"Hey guys, first post around here. I am a 22 years old guy, was diagnosed with ADHD and Tourettes very long ago. I've always struggled with motivation and stress. When I got to college, where you are expected to be organized, to do homeworks every day or at least every 2 days, I struggled a fair bit. I was able to make my way through with the support of my mom and my friends, but my grades were never amazing. I failed a few class but was able to barely pass most of them. Now with covid forcing me to work 100% from home, the struggle for way worse. I can barely listen during classes, being distracted by my phone/computer all class long. I tried to force myself to listen to class using only my phone, which forced me to not do anything else at the same time since multitasking is hard when you're listening to class on your phone only. But i ended up just letting my mind wander around. Then there's the fact that my field of study is software development, so i need to be productive on my computer.
Now, I'm in my final semester, 1 week from internship and i need to work hard to develop my 3 softwares for 3 different classes (all team projects where my individual contribution is a significant part of my grade). But like the whole semester and the one before it, when i sit at my PC, my mind just goes onto everything other than school work. If i close all distraction, I'll Justus emptily stare at my screen for hours.
I take maximum dose of Vivance (60mg) as well as Stratera (60mg) and Sertraline (50mg) for stress and focus, yet i can't focus well. We obviously cannot increase the medication 😅
I've tried Pomodoro, calm music (classical and other calm music), brown/white/pink/gray noises, i just wasn't able to motivate myself to start training/running. At this point i don't know what to do.

ADHD,"I don't know where to begin, but I know the reason why I am writing this. There is something seriously wrong with me and that is gravely limiting my abilities. I feel like I am incapable of achieving anything, my mind is a very dark place and also it is my dreamland, my ecstasy. I can say that long ago I created my own world within my own mind where everything was set on my own rules and where every thought, every idea, every fantasy, every worst nightmare came to a reality, where I vividly experienced and relished everything and anything that I desired for, it was and is far more better than my actual reality.
You can say that I am a DAYDREAMER, I am a person who lives in his own reality, a person lost in his thoughts, a person whose word means nothing, a person who hates the truth, a person living a fictious life pretending something he is not, a person who says but does nothing, a person lacking hardwork and dedication, a person who is not resilient and vigilant, a person who is scared of rejection, who is scared of being judged by people for what I am truly is, a person who hides under a veil of lies. There's much more to me than what I wrote above, sometimes I behave like a normal person and subsequently feeling completely untethered from my reality,feeling alienated. I've been feeling this way for a long time,to be more accurate it's been like this for me from the time I was born, I always felt different and got treated differently or atleast that's how I perceived my reality.

ADHD,"This might be a little ramble-y, but I'm pissed as hell. 

So I live in the second largest city in Sweden(Gothenburg) and was diagnosed with ADHD about a week ago. I got assessed and diagnosed by a private clinic that basically works for the government, so it costs as much as the regular ""free"" aka very cheap healthcare we have in Sweden. I was referred there by my old psychiatrist, a ""regular"" non private psychiatrist who works for the city of Gothenburg. The psychiatrist who assessed me immediately warned me that getting treatment for it in Gothenburg is extremely difficult and that they pretty much reject everyone for any reason they can think of. I have, like a lot of people with ADHD, several other diagnoses such as depression, GAD and anorexia, most likely as a result of my ADHD. For that reason, my referral was immediately rejected on the grounds that ""all my problems could be explained by those diagnoses"". They wouldn't accept me for treatment of any of those diagnoses though, so either way I'm left hanging. There are some other private clinics working for the city that treat ADHD for the same prices, but they have very few spots and the wait is super long. My only other option is to fund my medication assessment myself which would cost me about the equivalent of $1000(yearly), and that doesn't even include the actual price of the medication. That's pretty much how much I make in a whole month. I have friends who have had the same experience, and I feel so totally helpless. I got my diagnosis from a government endorsed clinic that I was sent to by a government employed psychiatrist, but now that I have that diagnosis they don't accept that diagnosis and that's just absurd. 

I feel so let down and I'm left alone with a life that's falling apart and no medical help. I hope I'm not breaking any rules by posting this, I realize that this might be a bit specific and maybe not relevant for people not living in Gothenburg, but I feel like I just wanted to hear if anyone else has had similar experiences with being dismissed like this.",ADHD care in my city is basically non existent
ADHD,"Hi! So I made a post yesterday about wanting to switch medications. I’ve deleted it now because I realised I made some mistakes and left out some important details. Really appreciate everyone who responded though - thank you! 

I forgot to mention that I’m also diagnosed with GAD, which I’m currently on 20mg Prozac for. I’ve found that methylphenidate (both Concerta and Medikinet) has increased my anxiety. It manifests physically in increased heart rate, restlessness, rapid breathing, intensifying my anxiety tics. But it’s also caused me racing thoughts and it’s been a lot easier for me to spiral into overthinking patterns. I would describe it as feeling like there’s a bunch of versions of me in my head talking over eachother, overthinking multiple things at once.

The two medications I’ve gotten the best reviews on were Vyvanse and Straterra. Does anyone know which of these might be least likely to give me psychiatric side effects? Or if anyone has any other suggestions, that would also be great. I’m diagnosed with GAD, but I had a short period of extreme suicidal depression last year so I don’t want anything that could trigger that again.

ADHD,"Okay just to be clear, I’m undiagnosed. I’m also not currently seeing a therapist (mainly because I don’t really know of any qualified ones in my country) but a lot of things I do are consistent with stuff I’ve read about ADHD.

I just want to know if anybody else has these moments where they do things but they aren’t really sure whether their bodies are doing the things or they’re choosing to do the things. Like, for example, a few minutes ago, I was laying in bed (I still am) and I was listening to music and I started to feel weird and uncomfortable and then I started hyperventilating and got some reason, even though my body started to feel cold and my ears felt cold and just... idk, like this static-y feeling in my body, i couldn’t help but think that maybe i was doing it on purpose (this has happened before).
Another example (this one happens a lot more often) is wanting to get out of bed but feeling heavy and sometimes unable to move and not knowing whether i just don’t want to move or if my body is refusing to.

ADHD,"One of my more significant ADHD habits is my spaciness. Usually it's most evident with the time it takes for me to get ready, or the moderate clutter in my house. But last night my cat ate some medicine that on the coffee table. I had put it away, but it must have been after he ate some of it. My partner was LIVID, which is reasonable, and they kept trying to get me to talk to them about my spaciness and why it happened but I wouldn't participate because I knew they were going to yell at me. The adrenaline rush just pushed me into action and I called the pet poison control line, we took the cat to the emergency vet, and it ended up being somewhat okay. I felt really guilty about the situation, so I cleaned up most of the vomit in the house. We somewhat talked about it, and my partner insisted they weren't trying to yell at me, they just had high emotions. I don't know though, I was scared. They had hit a wall (not that hard) when the cat threw up for the 4th time.

Anyway, when we got the cat back, we were getting ready for bed when my partner noticed a cup on the floor and I quickly remembered that it was a leftover cup of cleaning solution and scooped it up. My partner went OFF on me again and was basically like ""We just talked about this, I can't believe you would leave stuff out again, what the heck is going through your head"" etc. I tried to be nice to myself about all of this because I usually am very attentive to my cat and this happens to pet owners who don't have ADHD too. But my partner has been vocal lately about how bothered they are about my spaciness, even when I'm just getting ready to go out by myself or something that doesn't affect him. I tried to say I didn't want to talk about it, I thought they were going to attack me about it. They insisted we talk anyway and I ended up getting very emotional and saying that this is a part of myself that I hate but am trying to work on and that it was hard to be nice to myself if they kept going in on me about it. 

Obviously at this point I need to change my habits. I could set a timer when we're getting ready together so I don't hold us up and I could try to put stuff away as soon as possible and watch out for stuff I shouldn't let my cat get to. But what about the things that don't affect my partner? Will their distaste for my spaciness go away if I improve on the stuff that directly affects them? It just feels like sometimes they can't even hold back how much they dislike my inattentiveness.",My cat ate something he shouldn't have because of my spaciness
ADHD,"Hi all,

I've recently come to the realisation that I may have ADHD. I've just today reached out to a doctor to try and get in touch with a psychiatrist. I think early in life I managed to fly under the radar. I had behavioural issues and I was very tardy, disorganised and lacked motivation, but I was always ""smart enough"" to get by. I did okay in secondary school, achieving good grades in the end but never really put in the effort to reach my full potential. For example, I could never study due to how boring it was except on the bus to school on the day of the exams. I also have dyslexia which I think only compounds the issue.

Later in life I went to university and this is when I think it caught up to me. I no longer had a large support structure and needed to be more self reliant. Studying was so mind numbing and I'd often procrastinate. I failed my first year, but was allowed to retake it, only to fail it a second time resulting in me dropping out.

I managed to get an interview for an apprenticeship (based in the UK). The apprenticeship involved a degree again but thankfully I met my girlfriend who is the complete antithesis of me. I don't think I would have made it this far into my apprenticeship without her. She helps me organise and structure my study. 

I've read on this subreddit that people experience hyperfocus alot. This is something that resonates with me. I'll pick up hobbies and will dive straight it putting a large amount of my daily mental error into it.

I have a few more things that I believe may be ADHD related. I'm very forgetful, discorganised and zone in and out of conversations amongst other things.

All this time I've thought I was lazy and selfish. I hope I can work with my doctor to figure out what my problem is, ADHD or not. Even reading the list of symptoms was a massive Eureka moment for me. I read them to my girlfriend who simply said ""that's you"".",I'm 26 years old and I think I have inattentive ADHD

ADHD,"This is an unfortunate sequel to my post celebrating a good few days back on Concerta (18mg) after years off of it

As encouraged by my psychiatrist, I took it for 5 weekdays and then took the weekend off, so as to not quickly build a tolerance again and not feel any effects (I was nervous about escalating too much, because when I was in high school I was taking 54mg+).  This was something I did plenty in high school, as well as taking summers and winter breaks off.  Never really had any problem  with just not taking the meds for a while, that I remember (besides during school, when I was a totally useless sleepy lump without the medication).

I had a *good* week with the meds. I have developed more issues with physical anxiety symptoms/depression since high school, but I didn't really have any issues with all that on the meds.  Then on Saturday, after having not taken them, I found that I was sleepy, brain foggy, very emotional, and then later at night an issue between me and my partner resulted in me completely spiraling emotionally, crying in the bathroom and having really shitty thoughts racing through my head, and then after I thought I had let it out, going back to her and just fully having a meltdown - I'm not sure whether to call it a panic attack or anxiety attack or an emotional episode, but it lasted a while, and then the next day I was totally in post-panic attack mode physically.

ADHD,"then keeping it on the road would be relatively straightforward.

So I started wondering how much worse it might be for those of us with RSD which is sometimes triggered by abuse, but what if you have it before the abuse? As it seems an incredibly high % of adhd people have RSD. 

So if ADHD children are abused as well... Is it a double whammy with health in adult life? I know it's only speculation but I had both and have incredibly bad health. (it's also after 3am so I may be missing something).",Abuse and RSD

Hey everybody. 
So I was just sitting here reading about RSD and emotional disregulationand was wondering: Does this get better with meds?

As you probably figured out I’m still not diagnosed / medicated so I’m new to the world of ADHD.

Thank you for the response:)

Now for the character limit: Why is it still here. Why can’t i just ask a short question? Wambam mf",Does Rejection sensitive dysphoria / Emotional disregulation get better with meds?
ADHD,"Anyone else have experience with this? I think I’ve been accidentally doing it before all my relationships. Every time I get out of an old relationship, I hyperfixate on a crush very quickly (like in months or less) usually resulting in a new relationship. It’s a behavioral pattern I didn’t notice until now, and I’m thinking it isn’t good for me. Guess that’s my way of getting dopamine?? So... got any stories or ways to cope with this?


I’m new to this forum. I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD before but have not been treated for it. Other mental health issues took precedence. Recently I’m feeling like it’s time to pursue help (but, naturally, lack the motivation to get it)",Hyper-fixating on crushes?
ADHD,"So, while I do have combined ADHD with my medication (Vyvanse) I am able to be very organized and productive. However, I hate how when organizing or cleaning I can’t put things away. I forget what exactly it’s called, but I know there’s a thing with ADHD about visual memory, and how if you can’t see something you forget about it, which is very true for me. So, does anyone know how to organize things so they’re in sight but look neat? 
For example, I’m trying to figure out how the heck to organize my bathroom counter so my toothpaste and floss isn’t taking up a ton of space, but if I put it in my cabinet I’ll forget. :(",How to visually organize neatly???
ADHD,"In what way does adhd influence how good you are with people? I somehow made some friends because other shy people naturally tried to interact with me, so that's cool. But I often don't know how to bring up a topic or keep a conversation going. It's not that I can't do it at all, for example when I talk to someone about a topic I know stuff about, I can give them a lecture, but when someone asks ""what's up?"" I'm always like:""...nothing"".

Part of the reason could be that I don't experience much because of covid, but I'm still worse at stuff like that than normal people.

Another thing I want to talk about is being near people and touch. I don't have a problem with hugging people or giving them a handshake, but I can't for the life of me imagine myself having sex. Once a girl friend asked me if I wanted to have sex, but I was just so afraid of being so close to someone that I declined.

ADHD,"I was ""diagnosed"" shortly after starting college by a family doctor and kind of felt like my whole experience was half assed. I didn't like the medication I was on and got little to no feedback about what I can do other than take medication to help. I dropped out of school and stopped taking my medication bc I didn't feel I needed it if I wasn't in school.

Cut to ten years later, I'm married, a homeowner, and have a great job but I feel like I'm one mistake away from losing all of those things. If I'm not focused at work someone's life could be at risk (I'm an electrician). After stressing at work about no focus I get home and can barely help my wife out. I'm more work to manage than I am decent help with chores. I can't start any projects around the house because they don't leave the planning stages. 

I would love to know what the best way to get tested for ADD or ADHD is. I'd love to finally figure out what's going on in my head and what other help any of you can offer.

TLDR: didn't enjoy my first experience being medicated and dropped out of college.

ADHD,"I am currently on my first week of adderal, I'm taking 10mg twice a day.  My school has never gone this well, I graduate college in 5 months and I have always struggled for many reasons. This new diagnoses has helped me understand so much about my past. Recently with adderal I blew through this week with all 100s on projects that I usually would've turned in late due to fear or poor time management or whatever else. 
The problem is, I also have a fear of adderal, I'm always told how dangerous it can be and I've developed a fear of addiction. Today I feel like I need it to get through the school I have today, (lots of videos and reading and note taking). But that feeling like I need it to do something gives me guilt, like ""oh no they were right, I NEED it and I'm addicted"" It's such a weird cycle. (It's only been a week and I know that's not how that works necessarily, but feat is that over time this feeling of needing it to get through school will turn into something bigger later, but at the same time some things it genuinely does help me with (like school, something I have never been able to do well, even with cognitive therapy)",Do you experience guilt because of adderal?
ADHD,"I know not everyone has this issue and a lot of people who I know with ADHD have 0 clue what I am talking about when I tell them about my sensory issues- but I have met a handful of people that know what I mean so I will continue. 

Ever since I was little I can't eat certain textures. It makes me gag, when I was pregnant if the wrong texture touched my mouth I would have 0 control to keep myself from vomiting, and a lot of the stuff that I could eat without giving me heartburn during pregnancy made me puke so that's fun.

Whenever food inconveniences me like I spill something or make a mistake or get mildly upset at the food I usually just give up trying to make food. I can't imagine eating a food that I enjoy after seeing it act in a specific way that makes me uncomfortable (i.e. I can't eat cereal if I spill it and it touches my fingers because it feels soggy so instead of just filling it up with milk again I just throw it away). 

I try my best to eat but along with never feeling hungry because I have no concept of time and having foods that are my ""safe haven"" that never have triggered my textorial issues (mostly fast food or very basic dishes like chili or spaghetti) like I am not eating because I hate myself or don't enjoy food anymore because I do, but I have lost a lot of weight during covid as my texture issues have been amplified by the pandemic. I was so good at hiding them during a kid I was just told that I was picky/spoiled because my dad would give me new food when I would freak out at a specific texture/refused to eat something because I knew it had something triggering for it. 

I wish I knew what it was and I wish I knew it was a symptom sooner rather than being shamed so maybe I could have done something about it and not have such a shitty relationship with food.

ADHD,"A summary. I moved abroad with my dad and can't write the language but I can understand most of it. My dad had told me previously (a year ago) to look for classes that could make me more familiar with the language and the career I want to study (like Chemistry courses in Portuguese in order to learn the different nomenclatures n shit).

Naturally I researched for an hour after he told me and proceeded to never look into it again. Now I'm in Brazil. He gave up and sent me a link for a course and fuck it, this one it is. But. I just looked into the registration page and I'm already feeling burnout. Idk if it's understimulation, that terrible borderline nausea feeling of dread you feel in your belly when you contemplate everyhing you *have* to do and lose all willpower for it.

In all my years of school, I can't remember one time I sat down and studied that wasn't a final exam. The funny thing is that I don't find studying dreadful. I actually find it stimulating. That said, the *idea* of sitting down to study fills me with *so much dread* that most of my school life most of my homeworks were done between hours at school the same day I had to deliver them and I studied by reading friends' notes/the book minutes prior to the test. I never failed a subject but my grades are average at best.

I know I can't have this lifestyle in college. Even my LoL-obsessed brother has a routine and structure for college and he's studying *business* , I'm seeking a career in *biomedicine* . My dad doesn't believe I have ADHD even though my mom was diagnosed and that I'm pretty sure I have it so therapy/medication isn't available, and I can't legally get a job either, so I survived my last schoolyear by learning theough cheating and Fosfo b12.

Except I know that you can get addicted, and I have worked really hard to prevent that. I've been missing doses here and there on purpose to give myself days off at my psychiatrists recommendation.

My concerns:
Wellbutrin: apparently one of the rare side effects are seizures. I do not want that to happen. It sounds terrifying. Also I’m not sure it’s effectiveness for focus on adhd. I am inattentive type so my big issue is focus and productivity.

Strattera: chance for liver damage was something I read. That and even on r/adhd it’s very polarizing with a lot of posts saying it’s just the worst med ever. Also allergic reactions? That can happen with all three but I’ve heard them more associated with Strattera. And I’d rather not die from anaphylaxis because I wanted to get a project done.

Vyvanse: my past experience with stimulants, plus some of the heart issues associated with it. Rare side effects include literal death from a heart attack so that’s super cool. On the upside it seems to work well for people?

After having her baby (about three months later really) When calling her doctor whom has prescribed her medication for the last 7 years, she was told that since she has had a child she could no longer be seen by a pediatrician and needed to find a primary care doctor or a psychiatrist. Well, getting a new patient psychiatrist appointment is already difficult enough and with COVID it’s even more difficult- Earliest appointment isn’t until June in my area, which she is still scheduled for...

She went to the doctor and explained she’s been on medication for a number of years and couldn’t get into a psychiatrist, but wanted to establish care with someone since her pediatrician would no longer see her. (Physicals, sick visits, exc) and also get back on her ADHD meds until she could get in with the psychiatrist in June. (This particular primary care doctor prescribes my other sister who is 20 her ADHD meds regularly so it’s not like she doesn’t treat ADHD) The doctor told her she would have to take a drug test because her insurance wouldn’t approve her Adderall without one. (Not sure about this, but it came back negative for everything either way) and that once it came back she would send her medication to the pharmacy. Two weeks went by, so she called and asked what was going on, this was to the receptionist, who said her lab work hasn’t come back yet and they would call when it did. One more week goes by, she calls again, the doctor said “your lab results have not come back yet, if you keep calling me than I just won’t prescribe anything at all” this left her super confused and upset. She waited another entire week because she was too scared to call- this is her first time managing her care by herself, so she’s never been in this situation. The doctor said “okay- I will send in something” she sends in- Straterra. My sister was confused because she thought she was waiting on the drug test results- and would be back on the medication that she knew worked for her- and that’s why she had to wait so long. - anyways she ends up taking the Straterra for a month because “she’s just doing what she was told” - this medication made her extremely ill, and I told her she has to call and let this doctor know. She did, the doctor then calls in vyvance- (three days later) which was not covered by her insurance at all. She calls again, and explains the medicine isn’t covered- the doctor said “well I’ll call the pharmacy and double check on that and if that’s the case okay I’ll call something in-“ two days pass, and nothing. She then calls the pharmacy to see if they could possibly call and explain the vyvance wasn’t covered and needed an alternative- the pharmacist called the doctor. The pharmacist then called my sister back and said “I’m not sure what is going on- but the doctor said you need to find someone else to manage your care” she was just... shocked and confused- and in her words “embarrassed” The doctor calls her immediately after the pharmacist did, and tells her the same thing. She asks her if she had something wrong- it was obvious this doctor felt like my sister was “bothering” her. The doctor didn’t have an answer for her. She was just left with zero explanation and has been super upset about the entire situation and is scared to step foot into another doctors office... I have called our local health dept and explained to them what happened. The practice she went too, its a private owned office by one physician (this doctor) so there really is “no higher up” to talk to about what happened to her and how it has effected her. (which is what my local health dept suggested she do) I know she could have just gone to a different doctor, but getting to that appointment and finding a babysitter and setting aside the time is a lot for a single 17yo mom to a newborn, and has never been to the doctors alone for anything like this. Getting to a doctors appointment with ADHD is a struggle within itself, especially unmedicated ADHD. I feel so bad for her, and she feels just overall bad herself since and terrified to go to another doctor. Moral of my story- doctors like this really should not be able to do this to people- people whom are just trying to get well. I wish I could point her in the right direction to assure this won’t happen again- but I know I can’t assure that. I also really wish the doctor could be held accountable for this situation- or ultimately just really know how badly this whole thing has left my sister feeling. I also hope that this doctor doesn’t put other people through this type of thing...why must it be so hard to obtain medication for a something you’re clearly diagnosed with and have been for years and years... doctors really should take into account that people are there to see them to get WELL, not to leave feeling worse than before they walked in their door.",Wishing I could help my little sister- had her first doctors appointment alone and it has been a complete disaster.

ADHD,"Hi all,

I’ve recently been diagnosed with ADHD and I’ve tried adderall IR, concerta, and now vyvanse. 

- Adderall IR messed with my heart (tachycardia and heart palpitations a few times during the day lasting about 10-20 min at a time) and I would get anxious and depressed when it wears off. 

- vyvanse gives me the same heart issues plus dry mouth. But the come down is nonexistent. No mood changes as it’s wearing off. 

My question is: 

In your experience, will the tachycardia/heart palpitations subside eventually? 

I really like the energy and productivity boost and don’t want to stop the vyvanse, but at the same time I don’t want to have a heart attack or stroke due to the daily tachycardia. 

Anyone have advice or experience with this?",Vyvanse dosages
ADHD,"Within the past week or so, I have started having heart palpitations on my Vyvanse. I have been on it for 4 months so I’m not sure why it would suddenly be happening but I’m going to lower my dose and skip a couple days to see if I still have them.

Anyway, if I get them on Vyvanse, will I likely have them on meds like Adderall and Ritalin? Has anyone switched and had their side effects stop?
I will be devastated if I have to stop them completely because Vyvanse has helped a lot.",Likelihood of side effects on one medicine but not another?

ADHD,"I've used to do lists at work for the last 3 years. My format was basically this:

Date:

* Morning Tasks
* Afternoon Tasks
* Save for Later

This list format was good for me because if I didn't write down my assignments, I would completely forget that I was given them. Also, breaking my day into two parts kept me from feeling like my entire day was lost just because the first half didn't go well.

Now, my issues at work are a little different. Instead of forgetting that I was assigned a task, now my issue is predicting how long something will take and remembering to get it done by a certain date. I keep giving myself 30 minutes to do an assignment because that is how long it takes my coworkers to do it, but in reality, it will take a couple of hours.

ADHD,"Like with a roommate a significant other, a good friend for a next door neighbor, etc?

I find that if I live alone or in seclusion I am far less able to function. I will sit in my room staring at nothing for hours. I'll forget to feed myself or take care of basic household chores. I find myself unable to think clearly or articulate my thoughts unless I have someone to talk to about them.

Conversely, if I have someone at home I'm able to latch onto their routines and it motivates me to get up and be ""normal"". I'll be up early making breakfast for the people in my house. I'm reminded of chores that I have to get done. I am able to latch on to their activities and this helps me to think of more activities for both of us to enjoy.

the reason why i got no sleep wasnt because of the demons crawling on the walls like ghetto spiderman, but instead of a recent phobia that was somewhat caused by adhd meds.  Scelerophobia. (fear of crime.) {just wanna say im having a real hard time keeping my eyes open. feels like shit}

ADHD,"Hello

I was diagnosed with ADHD not that long ago, and I have mixed feelings about accepting the diagnosis.

I have just been thinking today about impulsive speech and that I didn't think I really had that issue, however, i was focussing just on shouting over people or blurting out things out over people such as opinions etc instead of just saying inappropriate or impulsive things.

I remember when I was like 14 and I was out with my cousin and a group of his friends who were drinking and im pretty socially anxious, always have been, but i've also always been known as the ""weird one"" in my big family lol, just because of the stuff i say or talk about sometimes i guess. So when I was like 14 I ended up saying some random stupid comment about how a kids genitals look like two tangerine segments, and everyone thought i was weird as fuck (and i know it is, but i just said it because i thought it would be funny idk) and even till this day over 10 years ago I think back and im like what the fuck is wrong with me fuckin weirdo freak who says that???

A different time a family member was taunting me and i was getting annoyed, and he would just not leave me along, like i think he was kicking me over and over. he was enlisting for the army and i said something akin to ""i hope you join the army and die in afghanistan"" or something, again, something which causes me to feel dread these days for saying something so mean and horrible in the moment.

at a job i had in my teens i randomly said something like ""dont you ever just go onto google and search something like i hate myself and i want to die and just read through what other people have searched?""(i actually spend loads of time searching random thoughts into the internet in first person to see if anyone has experienced this and reading through reddit post, idk anyone else who does this) and everyone thought i was weird as hell man honestly. Like among my friends they all think im cool and open and funny wwith a weird sense of humour, but to people i dont know i always feel so restricted and closed off and my voice goes hella monotone and i just express with my hands and i cant even make my voice louder and when i do talk im fuckin weird lol. i wonder if this is a learnt behaviour because of saying weird stuff and feeling like im such a weirdo

I recently got my dream job but every day is a battle with adhd that I always lose and I’m lucky that no one else at work has noticed it because I should probably be fired by now. 

It used to be better when I could go take my computer to a library or cafe or the office and be in an environment that encouraged me to be productive but working from home is so difficult, and I live alone so there’s no one I can ask to help pull me out when I get stuck in my head. 

I’ve been on Concerta/Ritalin for a few years now although since the pandemic I’ve been barely taking them because they tend to exacerbate my “ODC tendencies” (my psychologist’s words) and when I’m home alone there’s nothing I can do to stop myself. Not only that but I notice myself getting super anxious as well. I’ve been gradually reducing my medication dose and switched to Ritalin so I could control it better but I have a 10mg dose and taking half a tablet can feel like too much. Maybe methylphenidate is not for me, it worked the best when I had an intense schedule (go to work in the morning then go to school, hw and studying and doing extra work until nighttime, I was getting less than 5 hours of sleep every night and my depression spiraled but I remember the medication being helpful to adhd)

I’m so lost on what to do. My psychiatrist is one of those doctors that’s like “ok tell me what you want” instead of helping to suggest medications and doses and I hate it but it’s so hard to find psychiatrists where I live, he was the only doctor when I was first looking that would accept new patients and it took me months to get an appointment with him.

I’ve tried Adderall and for some reason I felt absolutely no difference when I took it. this was years ago so many I should try again? I also was thinking to try Vyvanse but I’ve heard anxiety is a common side effect of it so I’m not sure that would be better. I really don’t know what else to do. I tried to take a 10mg Ritalin today and I just felt sensory overload all day.

I will take 10mg one day and feel the good effects, next day I’ll take the same dosage at the same time and I’ll be sweating, have an upset stomach, and feel very sleepy. I’ve gone down to 5mg, same problem. Up to 20mg, same issue. I eat the same thing for breakfast every morning, exercise at the same time, I’m on a great routine and nothing really changes in my day to day.

The last year was really weird for me. I think I was majorly depressed, and I don’t know why exactly. There has been a lot of changes - aside from a totally new structure due to covid and the restrictions, I also started going back to college (I’m 28 now), and got into a new relationship, all around the same time one year ago. I think right now I’m coming out of this really bad phase, and to look back and see how much I fucked up is scary.

I stopped talking to all my friends around this time last year. It wasn’t because I felt like I didn’t need them anymore, I missed my best friends a lot, but I was feeling so overwhelmed about the new relationship. I lied to my girlfriend about meeting friends and stuff, to get alone time. She wouldn’t have mind at all, she was actually encouraging me, it just felt like I couldn’t get on top of organizing my life and needed so much alone time to just “be”. 

In the beginning my friends would reach out and then often instead of just replying I would postpone responding, because I was afraid that this meant I had to be fully there again and I felt like I couldn’t keep up. I kept waiting for everything to be perfect with university, with work, my relationship, and THEN I would reach out. Of course it never happened. I skipped some online classes, then got too nervous to join again and just ignored that. Every night I had nightmares about my friends, I was feeling paranoid when outside, worried of running into anyone before I had the chance to make it up to them. 

In summer group projects at college started and after missing two meetings I just disappeared because I had no good enough excuse for not attending, and then I was so worried that they would check in with me that I actually deleted all messenger apps and kind of just ghosted everyone in my life, and did nothing for university. I took one exam in two semesters, which is a huge waste of money and I didn’t even feel like I had more time or anything, I was constantly feeling guilty, stressed out and anxious to no end. 

Yet, despite having NOTHING going on in my life except for work and my girlfriend, I didn’t get in touch with my friends. I didn’t explain my behavior. There were serious illnesses in my family, and I didn’t reach out, I just kept postponing. The only people I was in touch with were my parents (the minimum amount!) and my girlfriend. I was really lonely, but I just couldn’t stop this horrible behavior. Whenever I gathered the energy to call, I started overthinking it to the point where I finally came to the conclusion it would be better not to do it. Then at night I had nightmares about it again. 

Last week was my birthday and I spent it with my girlfriend. Obviously no one reached out to congratulate me - even if they did, I wouldn’t have seen it since I deleted all messenger apps anyway. 

I think my girlfriend noticed and we had a huge fight about it until I was having a panic attack and didn’t stop crying for hours. She doesn’t know how bad everything is, because I don’t seem so depressed. I go to work, I hide my anxiety, I make jokes about wanting to die but who doesn’t, and she’s really bad at dealing with mental health issues anyway. She doesn’t know about adhd or executive disorder, and she doesn’t inform herself about it. She’s the kind of person who thinks you just have to work harder, behave better and be more disciplined. Definitely team “tough love”, which I’m not sure I like but I think I don’t  have the confidence or self esteem to verbalize it properly or set boundaries, so I’m always worried about her reactions and feel attacked about everything.

Anyway, she said I was a shitty friend, that she wouldn’t forgive me if she was my friend, and that there’s no excuse for my behavior. I agree. I think I let my friends down completely, I’m a piece of shit, but at the same time it’s easier to say this now that I feel more normal - I know this was a crazy big task when I was more down and lethargic before. 

Today I attended the first online lecture of the semester. It’s the first one in months I’ve attended. I told myself that just because I’m scared of my former group members, I shouldn’t skip my education out of fear etc. I didn’t know the code to the meeting, and neither did the students office so I had to install a messenger app and reach out to a student, ask him to add me to the group again and give me the information I needed. I did that but I was really nervous. I saw that I had been kicked out of my workgroups, and I think I have to apologize to the members because it’s a small university and I’m seeing them all the time (online), and I was already freaking out when the professor made us go to breakout groups, because I didn’t know how to face those people. One of them actually was in my former group but we didn’t talk about anything personal, of course. 

I also reached out to one of my best friends. I had already talked to her a few weeks ago where I learned that a lot of shit had happened to her in the last year, which I had totally missed due to my complete absence. We had some superficial talks since then but I felt like she was very distant which stressed me out, and I didn’t know how to address it. Today I apologized again and she was very honest and open, told me that she is always nervous I will abandon her again and how I seem to disappear when I’m in a new relationship. We talked about it for a long time, I assured her she was right about what she was feeling, I didn’t make excuses but told her what was going on, and she said she is still a bit cautious and thinks I was unfair and hurt her. She said she doesn’t want to hold a grudge and she wants to be friends again but we’ll see, I guess. I promised I wouldn’t disappear again but of course she can’t just trust me so I guess I have to prove it to her over time.


I have two more friends and more family members I urgently need to reach out to, but I don’t know how and what to say. I can’t be that open to my family about it and I’m sure they’re a lot more angry than my friend. This friend I talked to had been my very close, best friend for years, so I feel like everyone else doesn’t even want to listen to me. I think I owe them all an apology, without expecting them to want to be friends again, but my stomach hurts just thinking about it.

And my biggest problem is that I just don’t know how to never make this happen again because while it’s never been going on for so long, it’s definitely not the first time this has happened. Sometimes I’m so overwhelmed with social life, and everything In General gets too much. I wonder if I should just not have friends and relationships because I’m hurting people and I’m not cut out for it. Even though I’m a fairly social person, ironically, and get lonely quickly. 


If anyone read all of this, I’d love to hear your thoughts and if maybe you share some of these experiences with me.

ADHD,"Ive been on  methylphenidate 18mg er osm for about 4 months, back at the end of January we upped from 1x to 2x per day as I was only getting coverage for about 5-6 hours it seemed like a great boost at the time.

 Usually, I'd drive home, get drunk, and figure out what to do with the rest of my life tomorrow, but I have blood tests coming up next month and I'm not allowed to do that.

There are probably drugs one could do to calm down, too, but even if I knew where to find those, I still have those damn blood tests coming up and I'm not allowed to do that, either.

 Going out to do new things and meet new people is also absolutely out of the question because of corona.

ADHD,"Shortly after having my son, I started experiencing frequent panic attacks with difficulties breathing and tears and frustration as I'd never had panic attacks that sever. After a few months, I went to my GP, was diagnosed with anxiety and put on Cymbalta. A few months later, and a few dosage changes later, I felt like I was in the clouds, and I had no cares or worries at all, especially regarding work. So, after about 9 months, I quit cold turkey 

A few years later, I start to really feel down after some personal tragedies and got back to the doctor and decided to give a go again at medications to help. Only thing is this time, I was depressed. So, I tried Prozac, Lexapro and Wellbutrin with the same results: it works for a few months, but doesn't work long term. 

So, my psych puts me on Effexor, and it seemed to work, until it didn't. Then, I got prescribed Abilify to help with the depression, but I continued to have days where I could not get out of bed, and the panic attacks never went away. 

Finally, this January, we discussed the possibility of me having ADHD. I was prescribed Ritalin, and upon my first dose, I suddenly felt this weight in the front of my head. It was like something was bringing my head down and I could think clearly. I could think. 

Now, this has not been a miracle drug that has taken away all my problems, but for the first time in 9 years, I can handle things. I don't feel overwhelmed, and I don't lack any care at all. 

This was all to preface the absolute shit show that was my weekend. My cat was put into 48 hours emergency vet watch for bladder crystals, I suspect I have a friend with a pill addiction that required over 4 hours of conversations on how we're going to address this, my dogs got into a fight and tore open the other's skin that is definitely going to require stitches, and I have to stay up until midnight to administer the pain medication to my cat when I'd normally be asleep at 9pm. I'm exhausted, I'm emotionally drained, but something that would have normally had me in a corner crying and in an absolute state of panic all seems manageable. It's as if my brain is compartmentalizing all of the things that I have to do now, and is processing all the things I had to go through this weekend. 

I don't even know where else to go with this revelation, but I just feel like a weight has been lifted off of me in that every little problem doesn't have me pulling up the covers avoiding life for fear of my to do list. I don't sit and procrastinate doing anything else but what work I need to get done. It's as if I wasted 9 years being a guinea pig trying not all off the wrong meds so that I could get to this point of clarity and acceptance. 

I don't feel as if I'm relaying my true emotions in this post, but I feel I needed to share somewhere. I felt like I need to hear someone else went through this journey as well? I want to know that I'm not the only one to struggle with the weight of anxiety and depression when all along it was ADHD and my inability to process appropriately. I want to know there are others because maybe we can help 1 person avoid years long battles with the wrong answers. I just wish I had pushed the ADHD diagnosis years ago when I thought it might be just that. I wish I hadn't had to of thought there was something so wrong with me that none of the.medications worked to fix my anxiety and depression.",9 Years and I Finally Feel Relieved

Today he sent me an instagram post about how hard it is to be trans in the UK and I agree that it’s horrible and a difficult process, but before that my mind had been on how my rsd is going to be affected by going back to school and then I was just thinking of how that made me selfish because he was going through much worse.

ADHD,"I’ve pondered for a while that I may have ADHD. I went to the doctor and he asked some basic questions and quickly ruled it out, but I feel like I do!

Let me delve into this a bit deeper and explain how my brain works...
So this is something I’ve been having a tough time with all my life, I’m fully aware I do these things but I CANNOT stop my mind ticking wildly. I find a new hobby or a new subject or a new movie saga or franchise and I OBSESS! I’m 25, almost 26 and my most recent obsession is subscription boxer shorts 🤦🏻‍♂️, my last obsession was powdered energy drinks. I find something I like and my brain wants as much of it as I can get. I used to collect lightsabers and pop vinyls and then one day my mind is clear and I no longer want them. I sell up. I find something else I invest my everything into and then I just one day no longer care. I built my own pc and I was obsessed with making it look pretty and putting rgb everywhere, then my friend got a gaming laptop and I’ve needed a laptop for work, so I sold my pride and joy pc and bought a gaming laptop. It’s tiring. I was getting something delivered and cause it didn’t come next day like it was supposed to, I phoned the courier over 15 times on different days to try and get it sooner even though every time I rang, they told me it won’t be possible.

I’m currently taking sertraline for my depression, I lost my brother to suicide and I don’t have a great relationship with my family cause I think they didn’t understand me growing up. I’m quite bright and I always have been as I focus so hard at certain things but I throw it away cause I lose focus eventually. I often get called a wind up, because I can be a handful, but its because I bounce off the walls sometimes. 

I’m irrational when it comes to spending money. I buy things I know I don’t want or need, just to complete the set when I own a part of it, and I’m so satisfied once I’ve got it all, or more so when I almost have it all. Then once I have it, I just don’t care anymore.

I’ve been told it’s called hyper focus and it’s a symptom of ADHD-PI but I just need to know what is making me crazy. It’s putting a strain on my life and it’s making it hard for my fiancée and son at times (she is super patient with me and she is completely understanding, I just want to be better for her).","My mind is driving me crazy, and the doctor won’t help.."

ADHD,"I had a slight epiphany... that my ADHD _caused my restrictive eating disorder._ I was always called the daydreamer kid by my elementary school teachers, had my nose in a book at all times, collected hobbies, all that. There was sometimes stress at home and I had a hard time coping with minor things, and then my pickiness of food turned into full on “I will not eat.” It took too long to make anything and I didn’t like to eat many things as a kid. That went on for 11 years. So I was treated for ED first, because it was life threatening by the time I was 16, but they told me during inpatient admission that *”we can’t treat your ADHD because the medicines are all appetite suppressants.”* So what the hell now? How do I even juggle both without relapsing into one or the other? I don’t have a handle on either of these things. And of course there’s always anxiety, and depression if the lack of executive function to eat or complete schoolwork goes on too long. Time for a doctor, clearly.

ADHD,"My best friend (18 y/o; I am 17) struggles with severe ADHD, and as a byproduct of that he has trouble managing his emotions. Specifically, he is quick to snap at people. With the stress of school, this happens on pretty much a daily basis.

So far, I've suggested that he go to a therapist, but I obviously can't force him or his parents to get one. He already has a psychiatrist/psychologist and takes meds. Aside from that, I provide a listening ear if he's feeling particularly stressed one day and needs to vent to someone.

I suppose this is a bit of a rant but I'm also looking for any support/tips/whatever that you can give. 

Here's the thing: All my life I've been struggling to keep up with school and now that I'm at uni I'm constantly balancing on the line between failing and passing. However, with the pandemic and everything it's getting more and more difficult to keep going and I've basically stopped even trying. 

What I struggle most with is that I've lost all faith in my ability to succeed in life. Will I ever graduate? Will I be able to get a job? Will I be able to keep it? Will I ever be good enough to not always be failing? Is there a future where I'm not a failure?

OCD,"I believe I have OCD, and I realized it because of a scenario that happened recently. I lost my job at the beginning of February—I’m in architecture—and I immediately threw my portfolio and resume together and sent it out to a few of my favorite firms. Several days later I had interviews at all of them, and a week later had offers at all of them. For most people this is a dream come true, a validating experience, and a cause for celebration. For me, it was the beginning of a very difficult psychological episode—suddenly I had three very different life paths open up to me, all which I had only dreamed about and now was being forced to compare them. I went into a spiral of indecision and started calling everyone I knew trying to pry their opinion out of them, I asked people so much that it began to become a strain on my relationships and people asked me to stop but I couldn’t. I started stalking their instagrams, looking at followers and followers in common, reading all their posts, counting their likes, hoping to come to some quantifiable decision.  My partner got so upset with the state I was in that he was crying and saying he would have to leave me if I continued. I ended up listening to all of this outside information and made a decision based on it, and immediately regretted it. I began to go back to Instagram and scroll through the page of the firm I had chosen, trying to decipher if my decision was right or wrong. 

I acknowledge my reaction was neither healthy nor normal. I wish I could say this behavior was isolated to this incident, but honestly if it’s not one thing it’s another. I’ve spiraled about perceived illnesses, about stressful situations at my old job and in life, about my appearance, about lost items (big one for me)—pretty much anything with a moderate amount of uncertainty. I find myself repeating this behavior where I become this vortex of compulsions and emotions that pulls in everyone around me . . .  And I honestly don’t want to be this unstable force any longer. I want to figure out how to deal with this, to be mindful of my actions and accept my present and the uncertainty around it. Does this sound like OCD, and if so, what suggestions do you all have? What coping mechanisms have you found work for you? Thank you!",I believe I have OCD

OCD,"Hi, so for as long as I can remember, I’ve had these wierd thoughts such as ‘if you do xyz, something bad and horrible will happen’. For example, during online lessons, everytime the teacher stops talking, I have to put my pen down perpendicularly to the notebook. It’s just one of them, I have dozens of them every day. When I do them incorrectly, I can even have a panic attack.

It’s so frustrating, because I can’t control it. It used to be more extreme, as I could literally stop talking bc I thought it would cause something bad. And with all that, I thought it might be some type of OCD. So here’s my question, does this count as OCD? I don’t have a lot of other symptoms, but what happens to me is really weird and I don’t know anyone else like this. Do you also experience this?",Does this type of thinking count as OCD?

OCD,"cross-posted to r/ROCD

I always feel so abnormal/creepy/like a freak when I discuss how I feel sexual arousal. I cannot watch porn of strangers, and have a general dislike of pornography, even soft core romance scenes in regular films ""squick"" me out (personal term for feeling of intense discomfort). I also do not fantasize or have crushes on random people (Actors/Famous Sorts/Unnattained People). If there's no romantic/emotional investment or experience, I'm the sahara desert.

So basically I have been in a tumultuous 3 year long hell with an extremely abusive ex (lying, compulsive stealing, alcohol/addiction issues, cheating, ghosting, fake apologies, etc.).

When I first met him I thought it was a dream come true, and quickly realized it was too good to be true and that he was a complete fraud. The problem was I've never felt as intense a sexual connection with anyone else.

Even though he treats me like trash (""Step right up! Get your hot garbage!"") I still fantasize about him when I masturbate, compulsively. I try to forcibly visualize something or someone else or a different ex partner, but it doesn't work. When I try to abstain and deny myself self-pleasuring (extremely difficult, my libido is extremely high and a psychiatrist early on said that I had hypersexuality) I start getting intrusive thoughts of him and I having sex which I can see visually even with my eyes open. When I get those thoughts I also have a physical reaction that I cannot control, my vagina spasms, I get taps and presses and pokes all over my body. I feel basically like his ghost is touching me, having it's way. I moan inappropriately by accident when it occurs. It happens in public and I am SO EMBARASSED about it all the time.

I've always been an obsessive romantic since an early age, only have eyes for one and all that, and it takes me ages to get over finally finding someone attractive, but I've never been attached to the thought of someone who was so horrible to me. I know better, it's not healthy. I feel like an addict that just can't stop. I literally let this guy walk all over me just for a chance to sate my libido with him.

Does anyone else here have this problem? Does anyone have any advice?

Dating right now really doesn't work and I can't even find a single other person to obsess over instead because that's usually the only way I've ever gotten over someone from my past.

OCD,"I have been taking long showers since December. Averaging 1 hour 40 minutes to the longest one I took took me 3 hours. Today I managed to take a shower for only 57 minutes. I know it’s still close to an hour, but boy that feels amazing.",Today I took sub 1 hour shower
OCD,"I think it’s kind of an extension of moral OCD which has been one of the most prevalent themes for me for a while now. I watched pornography a lot growing up and I feel as if to some degree it shaped my perception of women in an unhealthy way for a while. I don’t really watch it anymore, and I’ve since begun to recognise and challenge these ‘ways of seeing’ in an attempt to better myself.


Nothing too extreme, but I mean this as in things like “seeing a woman’s body as inherently sexual”. I know there’s of course nothing wrong with being attracted to someone’s body, I guess you can’t help it, but I feel like for a while my view was automatically skewed in that direction sometimes, which I feel was unhealthy. I’ve noticed there’s still some part of me that immediately views it from a primarily attraction-based point of view whenever I see a girl who I may find attractive. As in like the primary thought is about whatever it is I find attractive about them as opposed to anything else. Of course, I realise this is bad and counter it whenever it happens, but still.


The problem is that I still have a constant impulse towards sexual fantasy. This is where the moral OCD comes in, I think. Because, month after month, no matter how much I feel bad about it, I always end up giving in to imagining stuff like that. I know fantasy is a normal part of sexuality - however, the stuff I imagine is of course reflective of stuff I’ve watched in the past to some degree. Not entirely, because I find a lot of porn kind of creepy/gross in retrospect, but it’s definitely still that kind of thing.


The problem there is that, if this harmful shitty prejudice I had (or maybe still have to some degree even if I know it’s wrong, I don’t know) was partially shaped by watching that kind of thing, surely imagining stuff that’s basically the same at a similar frequency would have the same effect? There’s the possibility that acknowledging these things and having the ability to therefore not let them influence my worldview is a thing, but I’m not entirely convinced. It’s frustrating in that aspect because I’m sure to some degree it’s OCD but it’s entirely plausible for there to be a measure of truth to it, and I don’t want to just go and move on with my life if I don’t ‘deserve’ to, if that makes any sense.


So it leads to this constant cycle of me not being able to help but give in to thinking about it sometimes (still not entirely convinced it’s not just me being a prick who doesn’t want to try hard enough, but that itself could just be an expression of the OCD), doing it, and then inevitably feeling awful about it afterwards. Often stuff I was okay with at the time of thinking about it feels kind of creepy or weird or not to my taste afterward, which heightens this (again, nothing extreme at all or actually particularly weird, so probably just an OCD overreaction as well, but, just kind of saying that it happens). So if I am doing something bad I’d at least like to be sure about it! But there’s no real way to be, and I don’t want to give into OCD if that’s what it is.",Sexual OCD
OCD,"I am not someone who would publicly post about this, but with each passing day I'm beginning to consider killing myself. I have ""Pure OCD"", and will have extremely vile intrusive thoughts.

It is a mixture of obsessing over past mistakes and feeling very guilty, intrusive thoughts, fake memories and feeling like I did something wrong when something makes me feel unsure.

OCD,"19 f. I think i have ocd because i have been obsessing over every bad thing i have done in the past and if it makes me a bad person and i will be stuck on a thought for a month. 2 days ago i was laying in bed and i had a thought about the time i first started masterbating(ik random). I was 13. And then i remembered when i didnt watch porn at the begining and that i would just use any sexual youtube video i could find. I remember i watched rape scenes in tv shows and movies that were quite graphic. 
And then i had a thought again that night that i remember at that age or maybe i was 14 i cant exactly remember i watched a youtube video(it wasnt real, it was like from a series) of this man who would rape his daughter and give her chocolate afterwards as to keep her quiet. Now i cannot at all remember if i masterbated to that. And i hate the fact that i dont know but also i am glad a bit that i dont know because then if i did do it i would probably get depressed and think about suicide again. 
I feel like im a sick person and a weirdo and if people knew they would be disgusted with me and hate me. I feel ashamed and it is making me think about suicide knowing i watched all that vile stuff back then. And the worst part is that at the time i didnt even think it was a big deal. It didnt cross my mind once that it was bad to watch it. I just watched them because i needed something to masterbate to. Anything remotely sexual. I am recently dealing with worries that im a pedophile. I think its pedophile ocd but i dont want to self diagnose. 
And something on tv came up about when someone was a child they were sexually assulted and then i had a groin response and then i was like oh no oh no and started worrying and then my mind was like oh you like the thought of that kid being sexually abused and then i was like omg what if i actually do because i used to watch those youtube videos as porn back then and therefore i think its okay for that to happen and what if i do it to someone and then came the STRESS STRESS STRESS.

OCD,"Hi, I'm hoping to share some advice that has helped me with my intrusive thoughts. I'm in my early 30s. I've had serious health anxiety since I was a young kid. Truth is I had IT thoughts too but once I healed my health anxiety, IT reared it's ugly head. That's when shit got real. 

To cut to the chase, the guilt I've felt my whole life has been feeling shame for having anxiety. How did I cope and remain high functioning? I drank coffee, drank alcohol, and ate junk food to keep myself going. If a SINGLE SOUL could have told me in my 20s ""hey caffeine is bad for anxiety, hey alcohol throws your neurotransmitters (the good ones) off for days if you have anxiety, and junk food is leaving you depleted nutrionally and fueling your anxiety, I would have spared myself years of anxiety.

I'm venting because after two weeks of less caffeine, no booze, and protein filled eating, guess what? The intrusive thoughts have not only lessened a lot but I'm finding myself wondering where they are at during the normal trigger situations...not a bad thing.

With the help of my therapist kicking my ass to finally accept lifestyle behaviors are throwing my system off, I'm better. And I'm just trying to share with other people who deal with this that sometimes we really need to do a hard check on our diet. Keep caffeine and booze if you want, but really, it's about nutrition at least to some degree. It takes energy to live with ocd. If we aren't fueling ourselves, we add to the problem.

OCD,"I move things around a lot. I’m very intense about it. I want to slow down, but I don’t know how to reel it in. It’s hard on me physically. Today I ran up and down levels of my house carrying heavy containers of things, turned a room into a faux spa room, and rearranged the dining room into the living room. My body hurts after doing this for so long. My feet are bruised, my back hurts, and I have a lot of cuts on my hands. I’m 21 and healthy now, but I worry about my future health.

I feel confused and scared about how to wake up and not immediately start moving things. I want to slow down, but I don’t know how without being miserably depressed in bed. It’s like my only mode when I’m awake is to be moving things. I start ERP therapy in April. Until then I feel like I’m scanning for a glitch in the system.

OCD,"There’s an ongoing conversation in all of our heads. Two voices, going back and forth.

It’s important to watch how we talk to ourselves, but what’s more important is the awareness that you’re always talking to yourself.

There’s you, the one who has always been there, observing every happening of your life and there’s this crazy roommate. He’s been with us for as long as we can remember, ranting and raving and rarely useful.

As he rides along on your way to work, he turns and starts to smile – Did you turn the oven off?

This crazy roommate is wreaking havoc on our peace of mind. The mistake a lot of us make is trying to appease a madman. We think that if we just go back and check to make sure the oven is off, then he’ll be quiet.

We’ve identified this roommate as crazy. But the dangerous thing is that we’re consulting them as we go through our day.

## Be the Observer

Remove yourself from the conversation and just watch. You don’t have to be either voice in there. You can be an observer who notices the madness going back and forth.

We know we don’t have superpowers, but we try using our mind to bend the world to our reality. We wrongly believe that a certain amount of worrying or obsessively imagining an outcome is going to impact it.

The closest thing to a superpower available to us is the power to separate life into two categories – what we can control and what we can’t. The power comes from being able to let go of what we can’t and channel our energy into what we can.

You will slip and your mind will run wild. You will catch yourself making the mistake of thinking you can worry the world your way.

Watching our mind is a practice. It’s not all or nothing. Just because you can’t do it perfectly 100% of the time doesn’t mean the alternative is 0% of the time.

The more you practice, the quicker you’ll notice your mind running off. You’ll notice it trying to control the uncontrollable and you stop. Then you channel your focus away from the madness and back to what you can control. Back to the present moment. You’re able to focus on what you’re doing and you’re not lost in your thoughts.

The happy life is the one where we put all our effort into the things we can control. We don’t waste time – which is what our life is – on fooling ourselves into believing we can control the uncontrollable.

**Ditch the Roommate**

Think about that voice, that crazy roommate. Why do we keep taking advice from them? If they were an actual person we’d run away. Our parents and friends would be concerned about us spending time together.

If this was a real person, we’d be cognizant of how they’re impacting our environment. Real or not real, they *are* impacting our environment. That conversation *is* happening. The quality of that conversation, which is a conversation with yourself, is your environment.

You definitely wouldn’t let this person contribute to your most important life decisions. You wouldn’t trust them to tell you who to marry or what career pursuits were worthy.

This wild roommate is really the primal part of our brains. Sometimes called the monkey brain. It doesn’t fit the times. It’s still on the lookout for lions as we walk down the aisle of the supermarket. And when it doesn’t find these dangers, that it’s wired to be on alert for, it seeks out new ones.

Instead of scanning the savannah for a lion, it’s overanalyzing why someone added a period to their last text but not the one before that.

Martin Luther King Jr. described this battle as the North vs. South of our soul. “""There is something of a civil war going on within all of our lives… And there is this continual struggle within the very structure of every individual life,"" he said.

It’s a daily battle. But one worth fighting.

OCD,"Going to crosspost this in r/mentalhealth and r/OCD.

So a few years ago now, I was diagnosed with OCD; unfortunately kept getting unwanted violent/sexual intrusive thoughts. I was on and off fluoxetine but now I'm sitting at 40mg a day and have been for over a year.

Over the bank end of 2020 during the lockdown (UK Based), I started smoking marijuana recreationally, I'm 26 at the moment so not a teen and assumed I would not be at risk of the side effects. I won't lie, I got greedy with it and between December and January I smoked most nights.

I smoked when I was a teen on occasion, all of the stoner films spoke to me and made it feel like this drug was harmless. I remember being about 19, having a big smoking and drinking session with some friends at the time.

After this night I felt an immense sense of depersonalisation and derealisation, I genuinely believe I have blocked most of this out in my mind but I recall it going on for many, many months and it effecting my studies at college and relationship at the time.

This eventually passed and I dealt with other OCD/depression related issues.

Going to the modern day, I couldn't get any weed from my usual guy so I went elsewhere, the person I bought from I have known years and trust 100%, he warned me ""It's very strong stuff so go careful"" (Lemon Amnesia Haze). I smoked in on a Saturday night, my girlfriend doesn't smoke so she was sober. I hit a bong and go lay on the floor in the living room. Time immediately lost all meaning, I started freaking out, BADLY. Even writing about it now is reminding me of it and making me very anxious.

I kept thinking I was going to act on violent impulsive thoughts about my girlfriend, she knows all about my OCD and trusts me not to do these things, but it felt like my OCD was telling me to hit her, hurt her, or that I had been unfaithful in the past.

I paced in the backgarden for over an hour on the phone to my family telling them how I'd made a huge mistake and crying. This eventually calmed down, I'd say my anxiety level went from a 10 to a 6.5, I managed to go to sleep about 2:30am.

The next day I woke up, still feeling like garbage, visited my mother, and took all the weed that I had and gave it to a friend who's a big stoner. (He went on to tell me he smoked one joint and passed out which is unlike him). I had a terrible few weeks, some of the worst in my entire life, I had to take unpaid time off work because I couldn't face speaking to people.

I went back to work as financial stress was also weighing heavy on my shoulders. I still don't feel I've recovered; I had been doing better until last weekend, I had a lot of stress after being part of a mental health group on FB; someone posted they are going to kill themselves at 3am, I was sensitive anyway as I couldn't sleep.

Ended up spending the night on the phone to the police, finding his address through Facebook and I visited the house myself at 4:30 when the police and ambulance were there just to make sure he got the help he needed (He has and he is currently in the mental health hospital recovering successfully!)

This has caused me to have another breakdown; I am philosophising everything and it worries me.

How do I know I'm real?

How do I know the world around me is real?

If it isn't real, does it all even matter? Does anything I do in this life matter?

How do I know my happiness is the same as someone else's? Does the colour blue look the same for me as other people?

How do I know my internal monologue is real? Or the voices I hear and things I see when I fall asleep, how do I know if they're actually hypogognic hallucinations or not a sign of something else?

I'm going down some dark rabbit holes and I feel alone and scared in it. I know I have OCD, so I am likely obsessing over this but it's scary as hell.

&amp;#x200B;

I was getting therapy for sexual/violent impulsive thoughts but we have put it on hold since my breakdown as we thought exposure therapy at the minute might make me feel worse.

I just feel lost, I am worried I may get delusions of grandeur or schizophrenic symptoms, just feeling really scared and want it to get better.

Also, the ""urges"" feel so friggin REAL! I know they arent but my body doesnt buy it. Makes my eyes all watery and sting all the time while my arms get the ""do it"" sensations.

Anyways yeah. Hate this.",Cmon maaaan TW: Self H-rm
OCD,"This is very long but I can’t afford therapy so I was hoping to share my struggles here.

In the last year my mental health has hit new lows but this is not a new development. I feel like my brain makes always me hyper-moral. Any mistake or possibility of a future mistake is absolutely corrupting and I should kill myself.

My elementary years were full of events of me making myself sick from stress and staying home from school. 

I spent most of my teen years and now my early twenties paranoid about being gay. My Mom repeatedly asked me if I was during my high school years. I never brought home any girfriends and my Dad was concerned that I did drama instead of sports. In unrelated conversations, my Mom has said God views homosexuals and pedophiles as equal perversions and sin. Gee thanks Mom. That’ll haunt me later.

I feel like I pushed to lose my virginity before I was really ready just to prove I wasn’t gay. Having sex for the first time outside of marriage (which goes against my family’s strict values) made me have a nervous breakdown where I wasn’t able to leave my bed for a week and was puking off and on with anxiety spikes.

I moved out of the house pretty young to get out of that environment, left the church and surrounded myself with LGBTQ affirming friends. Very sweet group that I love to death. However in the comfort and openness of this friend group I realize I’m not gay. My brain didn’t fear it as much anymore so I was able to think much clearer. I also had lots of sexual partners in this process. Never any gay ones. I was afraid if I had sex with the same sex and I truly wasn’t gay, then I would kill myself before coming out to my family.

That conversation with my mom though, stuck with me. Now I’ve been paranoid that maybe I was not gay, but a pedophile. This fear only became a possibility after I turned 18. I’ve deleted social medias that are high risk of having porn, including this one in the past, fearing some photos may be underage. I had previously planned to work in IT, but I changed career paths. I now completely fear the internet. It’s crippling. I love video games and when my friends moved to PC from console I refused for years just to avoid easy access to the internet.

My brother still uses a flip phone to avoid social media. He always told me about the dangers of
porn and it’s detriment to his marriage. That too has stuck with me. He doesn’t allow himself unmonitored computer time even when checking emails for a few minutes.

My mom and I are both on Lexapro for anxiety, she admitted to me that she struggles with extreme anxiety and thoughts of suicide. I told her only that I was suffering from stress. She encouraged me to come back to church, pray and ask for forgiveness for whatever has me unsettled and I could find relief. 

I have a fear of being alone and unworthy of love so I cling to any relationship to the point of codependency. I’m scared of my own identity so I share theirs. I don’t know who I am. I don’t know if I want to know.

TLDR:
There are many more subtle things I struggle with on a weekly basis, but my obsessions center on sexuality, morals, and faith.

OCD,"Hey guys, I am asking you for your help once again. Basically, I had an obsession concerning a night where I got drunk and had quite hazy memories. I spent more than a week being completely numb only thinking about the night, playing the thoughts again and again and trying to remember whether something like cheating happened. Even though I could not recall anything like that, I just kept creating scenarios that were just so real. 

What helped me quite a lot was telling myself that ""I might indeed be a cheat"", ""It is possible that I cheated on my partner"" and that ""It is possible that I have hiv or some other STD now"". Well, needless to say, even though this thinking pattern helped, I am now obsessing about being a criminal for not caring about spreading STDs and the thoughts like ""I might be a criminal"" don't seem to work at all...

OCD,"So I have been suffering from POCD for a a year or so now, centring around unwanted thoughts of sexual intercourse and interaction with infants, children, babies etc. It has been an incredibly distressing, confusing and painful time for me, and I can confidently say my mental health and general wellbeing has been the worst it has been. 

The subject or symptom I am bringing forth today is loss of attraction to my desired sex/woman, which I feel is mainly because whenever I try to enjoy a woman's (i.e) sexy bum, I will have countering thoughts of sexual images with children and infants, and images of children's bums, and how there are similarities between the bottom of, lets say, a chubby child and a curvy woman, and it just ruins my sex drive and attraction, as now I cant enjoy womans attributes, because I just have intrusive thoughts that disrupt my natural attraction to woman, that try and convince me that I would like to be sexual with a child. In simple terms, I have obsessed and compared and ruminated so much about this topic, that it feels as though my brain doesn't see the difference between the two, and as much as I have no attraction to babies or children, I feel my brain trying to constantly compare certain attributes to a adult body. Its so awful and hard to deal with! I love woman and there attractive hour glass figures, I have never once thought babies are sexually attractive, but my brain seems to try and find a way to convince me otherwise. This will often also cause groinal responses that only further induce my anxiety and fear that I may potentially be attracted, as much as I never desire to or am attracted to children in the slightest.

Does anyone have any ways in combating these kind of thoughts, I am sure there are others that have mentioned similar symtoms on here before, particularly when horny or in sexual activity with your partner, which can trigger these thoughts and ruin the moment.

I understand thoughts are just thoughts but the feelings or false feelings or whatever the hell they are, they are terrible. I am practically numb to this theme. I made the mistake of reading through some asktransgender posts from people who were clearly suffering from TOCD. One of the responses was like ""If it's just thoughts you're most likely not trans but if there are feelings than that might mean something"" (I'm heavily paraphrasing here). Then I thought but I do have feelings. But obviously it's false feelings right? Since it's OCD? But maybe it's not? Maybe this is gender dysphoria? And all of this was piled on to me 20 years down the line instead of as a child? Or what if I have memories that I can't remember? That is proof of that I am in fact trans and I've been in denial?

for context: my ex gf was sexually assaulted by this asshole guy in his dorm room when they got drunk once, she told him to get away from her or something along those lines and he continued to fondle her. After this happened, on my 20th birthday, all of my friends and ex gf came to a hotel with me to celebrate.

I think I have OCD, I'm not looking for advice on whether or not I have OCD, I'm just wondering whether I should go to a doctor because I don't want to go to one and then look stupid because what I think are obsessions or compulsions are actually completely normal. 

Basically the symptoms that I have are repeating words or phrases that I hear or see over and over again and if I don't something terrible will happen in relation to those words, I tend to say them in 3's, so if it's a long enough sentence I will say it 3 times, If its a few words I will say it 9 times so 3 groups of three and sometimes if its just one word I'll repeat it 27 times.

It doesn't necessarily follow this pattern though, sometimes I'll repeat it until it feels ok to stop. 

I also have a fear of contamination, I think I've had a slight fear for a few years but Covid-19 has exacerbated it. I don't think its too bad, sometimes I'll wash my hands two or three times in a row. I won't touch any food with my hands that I'm going to eat without first washing my hands, and if I touch a packet or something then I'll wash my hands again before eating my food.

Also I have a fear of the time whenever its the same number of minutes past a specific hour, for example 8 minutes past 8, 9 minutes past 9. If I see these times I have to say a specific thing in my head 7 times, (three times, so 21 in total) and then three more times just to be sure I've kept everyone I love safe.

A lot of stuff I do is purely just a ""feeling""; like spam clicking my right mouse button or tensing my neck muscles constantly or squeezing my eyes shut. None of that has any justification of preventing anything bad etc, it's purely just because the longer I go without doing it, the more ""uncomfortable"" I feel. It's like feeling a sneeze build up or trying to ignore an itch I guess? 

They're not tics I don't think because I *can* resist them, but eventually I cave. My psychologist reckons that at some point in my childhood I subconsciously started doing this stuff when I was feeling anxious and my brain misattributed those actions to reducing the anxiety.

OCD,i was taking prozac 40 mg for OCD . after 2 months of taking prozac   my ocd got better upto 75 percent.  so for another 2 months my ocd was 75 percent better but after that  me and my psychiatrist thought we should increase it to 60 mg. after being on 60 mg for 2 days  one of our relative died. and  we went to their house for  to meet his family .before this  I was having no obsessions but  only 1 obsession started  related to our relative death and i had those thoughts for 2 weeks and  my ocd started getting worse day by day  and after 1 month of all this my ocd got worse like before and  we thought if prozac have stopped working and we decided to stopped prozac .and we stopped it. i want to know if  my ocd got worse due to dose increase or prozac  stopped working or due to the our relative death which caused some obsessions and after this ( prozac )  we tried alot of  other ssri and antipsychotics but none of them are working. what should i do know. should i  retry  prozac or what,Prozac tried for OCD

OCD,"idk if this is related to OCD, but i kind of starting to experience anxiety every night before goin to bed, these intrusive thoughts always pops up in my head like what if i dont wake up tomorrow? what if one of my family members dont wake up, and i wake up and seeing them crying and panic that someones not waking up. It always happens to me, and i kinda rely on my sleeping positions to like avoid those from happening, like if i sleep on my right, everything will be fine then seconds later my mind opposes and i need to sleep on my left immediately, then so it goes until i fall asleep without tryin to. 

i also have these thoughts abt dead celebrities and its even worse, like i really cant sleep at all, some several nights that i havent slept on, cause i always picture their faces which creeps the hell out of me, and feel like theyre around me, its crazy that im more afraid of them than some people who died in our village....

i really want to know what these stuff are called, cuz im really scared to know that maybe im the only person suffering from this",im new here and i wanna know if this is related to OCD
OCD,Ocd controls me to do things i don't want to do like not have people over speak to much about my ocd otherwise i think i'm lying to others not go to the shops because contaminations. It makes you feel so trapped to the disorder people misunderstand me all the time because things like this as well when i'm thinking of what if i'm this or that then i belive i am in that moment maybe i give of a different vibe and my mannerisms change its so annoying becoming more aware of your ocd and actually how much it affects how you act what you say what you do and how you avoid facing it. Anyone else tired of this and how do you deal with people like this?,fed up of being misunderstood
OCD,"This obsession came on ultra quick, it's HIV. My first trigger was a hookup I had a few months back, never even though of HIV being even a remote possibility. Probably because I was too overwhelmed with the obsession that I could have gotten her pregnant. Luckily by the time this obsession caught up with me it was at six weeks and I could shell out $100 for a conclusive HIV test, it was negative.

I honestly feel dumb writing this to be honest but maybe it'll help me process. Honestly was having a good day, fighting compulsions, good mood etc. I went to get food from the grocery store and on my out I stepped in what I thought to be puke. No exaggeration an immediate 180. Panicking, what if there was HIV, immediately go to google, no reported cases ever from vomit contact. Breath of relief? Nope!

Still in full panic, went home put food in freezer, didn't know what to do, thought spiraling, only compulsion I had to do was to go back and look at what I thought to be puke. [Didn't look like](https://gyazo.com/0a57612f344838af64dba2e746e218b3) it, but was still paranoid. It kind of settled, I agreed to just not eat the food in the freezer? Couldn't even bring myself to throw it away.

\~One week later I decided to go by MORE frozen food and put it in the freezer AWAY from the other stuff, great! Was calm for the time being. Room mate moved it on top of the other food. I was so hungry one night I decided as some sort of self ERP bs to eat the food on the top, which wasn't even touching the boxes of food that was from that day (or so I think). Weird circumstance, but this food had a sauce that went with it that had to be opened, did that with my *contaminated* fingers. Put the sauce on the already warmed food, ate the food, and since been in a panic everyday, taken by the fact I am going to get HIV. I can't shake this one, I really can't. Will have to wait six weeks until I can test (conclusively) so seems that is a bit away :)

It's kinda awkward and worrying that I am overbearing.

OCD,"The OCD takes hold, you may not notice it, you may not realize it, but it's there, whispering to you.

It may start small, like washing your hands a few extra times.

It will start to control you, more and more, that whisper starts to become louder and louder.

It will gradually control you more and more, it will increase so slowly that you wont even notice it.

Once you finally realize that its a problem, its already too late, it will have its grasp on you, you will start to bind with it, become it, start to live by its rules, by its demands.

It will strict you of all your thoughts, emotions, joy.

All these intrusive thoughts, telling you something bad will happen if you dont do them, but doing them will put you in a spiral for something much worse.

You must fight it, I know its not fair, a uphill battle. But its possible.

It will torment you, it will scream louder and louder demanding you to listen to it. Do not listen to it.

Start small, instead of washing your hands 5 times, wash them 4 times. Instead of checking the door 20 times, check it 15 times.

If you can imagine a ladder or a staircase, each time you fight against it, is one step up the staircase or ladder, and at the top, is your freedom.

This fight will get easier and finally you will be able to silence it down to a wimper. You won, you did it.

Now let me ask you a question, would you rather live your precious life while time is ticking, doing what it wants? Fulfilling its demands? Sacrificing your limited time, energy, happiness to satisfy it for a short period of time? Or do you want to do what you want to do, live a life that you want to live, stop wasting your time on it and start using that time to progress and do what you want to do. 

Its a simple as be a slave and satisfy it, so you can get some relief. Or fight it and be uncomfortable for a short period of time to make it easier on yourself in the long term, and finally start doing what you want to do.",OCD - Mental Slavery or Freedom. It Truly is Your Choice.

OCD,"**TL:DR: My OCD is preventing me from making life decisions; do I give up working for a business with good culture in exchange for an unknown one to get skills that align more with me as a person, accept an extra days work each week when being part time has been good for my mental health - or trust the promises of my current boss who has offered me a different position which I would enjoy, away from my current team leader role (which I hated), with a view to support me get into something more technical in 12 months time? Money is not a factor.**

**PS. sorry for the length of this post, though it does add some context to the situation!**

I appreciate this is not a place for career advice, but I feel that people here will understand what I'm going through.

I'll start by saying - I hate my job. I'm a people manager; and as someone with OCD I'm far too empathetic, which gets in the way of being able to discipline etc... I've spent sleepless nights thinking about work. My boss knows this as I've shared this with her over the course of the last year or more.

So I went part time last year - I have a day each week for self care. At first that day was being used to study web development thinking I need to find my passion (I love anything techy), but it didn't stick - so it literally is just a nice break in the week but I value it a lot.

**Here's my problem:**

\- ***The new job***: I have been applying for more techy jobs and found a role as a systems analyst for a company which deals with medical grievances - this is quite a triggering subject for me as it reminds me of investigations i've been forced to conduct at work, and my own family history as sadly people in my family have faced prison time etc... which of course all impacts my mental health over time. I'm trying to ignore the fact that this company does this as I wouldn't be directly involved, I'm there for the systems not the core role. It sounded great and I had no doubt in my mind about leaving my current job - even if it meant giving up my day off in the week. They have offered me this position and I accepted.

\- ***The current place of work:*** I have a new dilemma, just before my job offer came though (minutes before), my boss has offered a job swap that would make me a project type person working to improve the customer service that the team provide. I shared at this stage that I'd accepted another role as I felt it responsible to do so then. The thing is **I would enjoy this role**, but my future there would still be uncertain. She sees me doing this for only a year then *promises* to find me something more aligned with what I want long term (something more techy/analytical) - and not go back to people management. The culture here is good, they've supported me throughout my mental health journey by allowing me time for appointments, approving the part time hours and being generally very flexible.

\- ***The decision:*** so, my OCD is currently preventing me from making a decision. I really really value my day off, I can keep this in my current place of work, have a new job for at least a year without any people responsibilities, but I'm unsure what the future holds. I'm scared to give this up and start working full time again without much knowledge of the new business (glassdoor review suggests the culture is good and there is an element of home working) - however the role with the new place itself will give me tech skills I can't currently present on my CV. Been thinking about it for 3 days now and no closer to a decision (as far as the new company is concerned I have accepted and they are charging ahead). Ps. Money is not a factor, I'd technically earn more full time.",Decision about my job - OCD preventing me from making a decision!

OCD,"I have found that a habit checklist can be helpful for my mind and health, until the moment it becomes severely unhelpful.  I recently started a simple daily workout routine.  I lost most of yesterday simply because I didn't feel like putting on sneakers and jogging for five minutes.  I decided I ""couldn't"" take a shower until after doing my workout, which meant I couldn't eat lunch, play an instrument, answer emails, or just read a book.  Instead I got back into bed and ruminated on the past for a while, culminating in a needlessly long nap.  There have been other times when I needlessly stayed up late trying to motivate myself to complete every single habit on my list.  Sometimes I can't fall asleep until everything is complete.

Despite this, I still see a lot of value in routines.  Getting outside and exercising is helpful, and so is cultivating skills daily.  But how does one stick with daily habits without getting drawn into torturous rabbit holes?  Is there anything you have found helpful?",How do you develop daily habits without OCD taking over?
OCD,"I have OCD, and many different sub categories of ""Pure O"" but one of my biggest ones is disgust OCD. Anyway, every single time that I move into a new apartment, I get absolutely disgusted by everything for about 2-4 weeks before it subsides a little. I get grossed out by kitchens and sinks and fridges and physically cannot cook (not as much in newer buildings but still happens) and when I go to cook a meal, by the time I am done I can't even eat it because I am so disgusted. I have to buy my own type of dish soap separate from my roommates because I can't stomach the smell of Dawn and freak out at the chance of it leaving behind a smell on my dishes. I get grossed out by peoples utensils if they are too big. I can't use ANY form of plastic or dark dishes and have to use white or light colored ceramic or else I feel repulsed. I hate showering in new apartments because if the shower is older and theres a piece of the tub that came off leaving a rough patch (not sure how to explain this one lol) and it touches against my foot, I want to gag. So it's always been very difficult for me because I feel like a giant freak and can't just be honest with roommates or anyone about my struggles because they usually just write me off as being weird.

OCD,"POTENTIAL TRIGGER WARNING




I’m so terrified of saying obscenities or atrocious things out loud that whenever I’m in public I am constantly making clicking sounds, clearing my throat, or making syllables or sounds that sometimes resemble curse words or disgusting hateful things (never saying the actual word or at least I would never ever ever ever ever intentionally do so in this compulsive checking process) to prove to myself that I didn’t just say them (like checking different sounds—idk my brain has convinced me this helps), and to know I am not saying them currently. 

I also become painfully aware of my tongue’s position in my mouth and convince myself every little movement or sound it naturally is making sounds like a bad word, and then have to compulsively recreate all those movements and sounds over and over thus restarting the process.

I’ll check how different syllables feel and sound to make and repeat them over and over and sometimes accidentally make a few sounds that somewhat sound like a hateful or obscene word when said one after the other in public and start the whole panicking and guilt all over again—even though I have ZERO intention of saying anything bad to or around anyone and it’s probably only my OCD telling me I did! I am not a hateful person, and would never say anything hateful to someone else. 

I know that our thoughts don’t define us, but this feels like action, especially when I know the sounds I’m making or the syllables I’m making could resemble whatever bad word I’m hyper-fixating on in the moment. Yet, it’s like I can’t stop. If I don’t make the similar sounds, I feel like my OCD will somehow say the ACTUAL word or will convince me I did already—so the compulsive sound making keeps me in check. 

But also i feel like I need to “prove” I can make similar syllables or sounds without saying whatever word or phrase I’m terrified of saying, and that it’s okay to make those sounds.

It’s like very layered but anyway today I completely felt like I was not in control of my own vocal chords and mouth movements. It was terrifying and I kept making sounds that resembled different bad words, slurs, or phrases in public despite the fact that I was making the noises literally to avoid or prove I wasn’t and never would say the actual words! (And I really, truly wouldn’t and would never have an actual urge to!) 

I’m so depressed I feel like never leaving the house again in case I unintentionally offend someone or lose control or keep having these vocal compulsions that are too similar to my biggest fear . My OCD is getting so much worse again, and I feel so very alone.",":( i am now afraid to speak, and feel I’m losing control of my own body and am having verbal compulsions"
OCD,"I want to preface by saying that I am a healthcare professional (though do not have experience working directly with people with OCD, but do have experience working in mental health helping people with anxiety). I do generally consider myself to be pretty sensitive/considerate, but obviously things are different when its a family member/someone you live with daily. 

This family member has always been somewhat ""picky"" about cleanliness/sharing since they were young which honestly was irritating/may even come off as snobbish (ie. being really difficult when you ask to share something like toiletries you forgot to bring when travelling, using a living room blanket they feel is ""theirs"", using their bathroom, etc). 

Recently, the pandemic has definitely heightened their need to be clean. They frequently wash their hands much more often than any of us throughout the day, sometimes 3 times within like a 15 minute period while not doing anything that visibly spoils them and may ask for reassurance that they're clean. They do typically spend a lot longer than any of us in the bathroom in the morning/night. Avoids going outside more than the rest of us during this time, cleans hands constantly with alcohol outside and makes sure we do the same. These have felt somewhat like obsessive and compulsive tendencies (beyond just needing to be clean).

I think as a family we generally do try to be understanding, we almost never ask to use her bathroom anymore even though its located most conveniently to common areas. She has her own set of plates/dishes/cups (which she bought because they were cute) and does not let any of us use. We try to do the grocery shopping /outside chores, even my parents who are at way higher risk of COVID complications than her. But I think the thing that bothers me most is she gets really annoyed (and expresses it passive aggressively) when people move/touch her things. This can be as simple as a plate she left in the microwave, or a cup she left by the stove that was in the way so we moved it for her without asking (we already ask more often than not to avoid her irritableness). 

Obviously, I do not feel comfortable saying she has OCD, but to people who experience cleaning as a compulsion due to fear of contamination, is this something I should be more understanding about because she may experience very real fear/anxiety over what would happen if I touch her belongings/share her things? I think it's been difficult because we often feel like we're the ones ""dirty"" because of her behaviours, and the little inconveniences of having to ask and wait every time for her to move her own things accumulate.

I've been trying to get more involved in community and social justice activism, raising awareness of bigotries and human rights abuses, intersectionality, calling out people including friends , and cutting them off where necessary etc. However, I've recently become very self conscious about what I'm saying and doing again.

I also start questioning whether I should be friends with people who don't precisely align with my values...which I worry is really not good for my social skills tbh but the urge to do the right thing is there now!   


I don't know whether this is just weak boundaries or some form of moral OCD, because I've had Pure O in the past (diagnosis is GAD, and ASD with depressive 'low mood' tendencies) I also wonder because I'm an ex Christian, and while never a fundamentalist, when I do try to be selfish I get the feeling of sinning like I used to.

I am at a really low point at the moment as it is affecting me greatly and not really the best time either since I have college admission tests coming up and senior year is kicking my ass. I feel like an idiot that I forgot how to do the most basic things ever like going to the loo ever since succumbing to my contamination thoughts. It started off small, like paying extra attention when going to the bathroom at home or in public(if absolutely necessary) I managed my way around them and it wasn't much of an issue as I could still use the loo and never really had to do anything extra rather than maybe a quick clean up if something splashed on me, e.g, pee or from the toilet but it gradually got worse, I'm at a point where I just feel germs spreading around and I'd have to soap up my bottom half(including my vagina and butt) I have a problem with feces somehow getting there and I never feel clean. or even take a shower after using the loo. I used a bidet my whole life and I have never had trouble and always felt clean but now I can't even use it properly even drying my private areas, if I didn't do it in a certain way, I would soap up the area again and dry myself again. I usually used to dry myself with tp when using a bidet to clean my behind but started letting it be n it dries quickly but now I have an obsession with drying it and I can't manage to dry it using a couple of tp.

OCD,"it’s been months of me constantly worrying that i’m racist, homophobic, ableist, etc. i’m worried that i support everything that i’m against. i’m worried that i’m against everything that i support. the internet’s cancel culture has made this all get so much worse. sometimes horrible thoughts pop into my head that go against my morals. today something popped into my head that involved calling someone a slur and i am so upset about it. i kind of brushed it off as an intrusive thought earlier and knew i didn’t think like that but it just hit me that i actually thought that thing in my own head and now i’m really really upset. this is killing me. i can’t talk to anyone about it because i don’t want to hurt anybody. i feel like i can’t take this anymore. i don’t want to be this type of person. i just want to be a good person, why do these horrible thoughts pop into my head? i don’t want them there. i want to be kind to everyone. that’s all i want.",obsessing over morals and having intrusive thoughts that go against my morals. does anyone else experience this?

I think it could really help people with OCD to have a thread of lesser known or less obvious symptoms. It could become a compulsion to check the list, of course, but it could also help people to understand their minds a bit better. I'll start off and anyone who feels comfortable sharing their symptoms can add on. This might get a little embarrassing at some parts. Bear in mind this is mostly going to focus on harm ocd but any other forms are welcome.

1. Altered perception - When you have OCD, you will convince yourself that everything you do ties into whatever your obsession wants you to believe you are. You'll read articles about disorders and your brain will literally lie to you and make you think you fit the symptoms, even if some of the symptoms are 100% normal or don't apply to you.

2. Cold sweats - When you ""realize"" you're a narcissist/sociopath/psychopath/pedophile, this feeling comes over you like you've just realized your whole live has been a lie and you need to do something about it. This feeling is so intense it gives me the cold sweats, not sure if this is common or not.

3. ...Bathroom issues - This one is definitely tmi and pretty gross but I have to know if this is common with other OCD sufferers. We will literally worry ourselves sick to the point of having diarrhea. 

4. Invisible compulsions - I used to think I didn't have compulsions until I began taking online tests constantly and researching mental disorders to make sure I don't have them.

5. Subtle self harm - Things like skin picking, withholding comfort or entertainment from ourselves, or thinking we don't deserve therapy are forms of self harm that are less obvious if you don't know how to spot them.

6. Moments of clarity - Sometimes our OCD gets tired and decides to leave us alone for a few seconds. It's the best feeling ever and also the worst because you know it won't last long.

7. Cycling themes - This one is probably pretty standard but still worth mentioning. Often times when we tire out one obsession, a new one comes right after. 

8. Obsession with purity - The post I made about this is what inspired me to make this list because it seemed to resonate with people. Essentially, some people with OCD cannot accept that they are less than perfect, but not in an egotistical way. We're just so scared of being harmful that the thought of us being capable of it brings us to tears.

OCD,"okay, backstory. i have to take pills for medical reasons, and i have this thing where if i dont take them i will die.

OCD,"I am not religious neither did I grow up consistently practicing a religion of any kind, but one thing I've noticed I do is a sort of ""karma"" type thought process. I think something awful and negative, I try and tell myself it's not going to happen and that its dumb, and then because I brush it off or say it won't happen I get anxiety that it WILL happen because I said that it wouldn't. This thought process is applied to many things, just slightly different in each scenario. For example; a family member being gone for a bit longer than expected and most cases everything is fine and I tell myself its unrealistic to get freaked out everytime and that everything is okay, but now that I've said everything is okay, all of a sudden it will happen. There's no way to console myself after I get this way, I just get stuck in a spiral of ""what-ifs"" and usually, that just means ""it will happen"".

OCD," I wanted to pray to Gods about something using my thoughts (praying thoughts).

 A conversation between my brother and father drew my attention and my praying thoughts continued without me paying attention to them cause I focused on the conversation.

After 30-60 seconds, I started worrying without knowing exactly why. I randomly started worrying that I MAY have messed up my words and kept repeating the same mistaken word more than once, without realising it. That mistake maybe made me look like as if I was asking for something bad.

I cant remember making such a mistake. Maybe it is just an hypothesis just because I was not paying attention to my thoughts. 

What if I made that mistake and I forgot it but my subconscious remembers it? What if Gods thought that my accidental prayer was a real prayer just because I kept repeating it in my head more than once?  What if Gods thought that it was what I wanted?

 Before that, in the past, I have said to Gods that mistakes may happen in my prayers and no matter what I say or think, with or without my will, NEVER ACCEPT THOSE THOUGHTS/PRAYERS and protecet me from them. 

I wanted to have a safe rope so I would not worry for similar cases like this. But, what if Gods thought that I changed opinion and that ""bad"" was something that I wanted? I just could not focus on my prayers. I remember feeling a little anxious but I cant remember making such a mistake. I am not sure if it just an hypothesis or if I really made such a mistake. 

I DO NOT WANT ANY OF THESE THINGS! I HAVE EXPLAINED TO GODS MANY TIMES THAT I WILL MAKE MISTAKES WITH MY THOUGHTS, PRAYERS ETC AND NEVER ACCEPT THEM NO MATTER WHAT I SAY!

OCD,"I'm feeling pretty drained lately from my obsessions and since plain searching the internet hasn't come up with anything I'm turning to Reddit for help.

I have a strange type of OCD that I haven't really seen anybody else mention. This revolves around needing my things to be ""perfect"". Scratches, dings, dents on anything, even pots and pans, result in me having to get rid of it and get a new one. If I don't do this, I obsess about it until I get it done.

I also have some obsession over washing and doing the dishes and washing my hands takes way longer than it should. It's mainly the rinsing part that seems to take forever, because I have to continue until it feels clean in my head, even though I know it's already perfectly clean I'm afraid that any microscopic soap residue might still linger.

1 - If you’re looking for a therapist or psychiatrist, use the search by location tool on the International OCD Foundation’s website to find OCD-certified or OCD-experienced therapists. This will help ensure you get the right kind of help! Also, zero judgement because these people get OCD. 

2 - If there are barriers causing therapy to not be an option for you, a cheaper alternative is to read an OCD workbook. For example, I own “The Complete OCD Workbook, A Step-By-Step Guide to Free Yourself From Intrusive Thoughts and Compulsive Behaviors” by Scott M. Granet LMHC. I got it on Amazon!

I have to touch light switches a certain number of times, push on water faucets a certain number of times, and sometimes if I'm just anxious I'll just blink or shake my hands to try to feel right.

It's different I think but I don't know how to explain how or how to know if I'm even right.

However after struggling for decades- and many years of on going treatment- I have reached a point where I feel like I have plateaued in terms of recovery. My life is functional, my OCD is relatively manageable but everyday is still a struggle and most of the time life simply feels like one big ERP exercise rather than something that is ever actually enjoyable.

In the beginning it started with small things like moving my glasses when i sleep because they were on her nightstand and objects of others shouldn't be touching her belongings. But it has gotten so much worse since then.

I can't be in her bedroom while she is away, even when she has to go to the toilet. Touching (like hugging) has became off-limits when she is sad or stressed, and she has developed spastic movements while sleeping. 

There are so much more of these examples, and although they are a inconvenience for our relationship and quite stressfull and hard for me (and ofcourse for her), she is the love of my life. Like literally, she is the most beautiful person there is.

OCD,"The title says it all. 

I didn't notice what an irreversible tragedy my life has become.

OCD (and intrusive thoughts and images of even sexual/violent nature) ruined my life and I didn't even know it until it was too late. Because I didn't know it was OCD. I just thought I was fucking weird due to childhood trauma. I didn't know it was a mental illness, that was completely normal and had a cure/treatment. No one diagnosed me, no one gave it a name. 

I diagnosed myself some time ago, but didn't seek treatment for some reason (I thought I was way too ""fucked up"" to treat. That the baggage ways way too big. THIS IS NOT TRUE.) And now it might be too late.

I lost 15 years to this.

My mother has a lot of mental issues so I think I inherited it. I had a rough childhood. My parents divorced when I was little (very bad circumstances) and my mother had to basically escape in secret with me from abroad. 

We kept moving. From my grandma to a new city and to another one. I didn't have any security, sense of safety and home. This was what caused the underlying anxiety that got worse over the years.

My mother loved me back then but she was not enough. I had a weird relationship with my father (living abroad, he didn't really contact me even though he loved me.)

I was already very anxious as a child and thinking back I was definitely showing OCD tendencies.

But I was always FULL OF LOVE and empathy. I could never tolerate injustice and was a highly sensitive person.

My first panic attack happened when I was 11 after a passing moment of DPDR (as a result of my mother being tipsy on her birthday and my child self/brain couldn't handle it, I guess.)

I kept having panic attacks (not hyperventilating, just super fast heartbeat and being super scared) so we went to a psychiatrist.

She didn't give it a name. Didn't diagnose me. Didn't reassure me or told me it's fine.

She called it: "" you riled yourself up"". WTF. Incompetent trash.

She told me if it ever happened again, I should watch TV (and then maybe our upcoming holiday would get rid of 'it'. WTF.) So that's what I did. And then at night I would listen to the radio.

The holiday did not get rid of 'it'. Obviously.

I also developed sleep walking, but stopped after a few months. (At one point I almost climbed over a balcony fence while sleep walking. It was a second floor apartment. Terrifying.)

(My panic attacks stopped after a while (can't remember when precisely.) but came back for a Summer in high school and I would get them 1-2x/year after that.)

My mother's new boyfriend started to be worse and worse (narcissist, verbal abuse) and became my worst enemy and source of the life ruining OCD. He is a vile, disgusting man. Absolute trash.

It was in high school that I started to develop the real OCD.

Everything he touched became dirty to me. After a few years I couldn't even listen to his voice, I had to sing or cover my ears. I started avoiding objects in my room and obsessively cleaning everything.

I couldn't watch my favorite TV shows because my whole area seemed dirty. I don't know how to explain it. His pure presence in the house was enough to feel dirty.

There were items I kept in a box so they would remain clean.

I couldn't wait to move out of the house and into my own so I can finally enjoy things again.

But that's not how it works.

In my new house there were things that were already contaminated with ""his touch"". Obviously.  So I started avoiding those.

My two half brothers (their father is this man, but I loved THEM so much): I couldn't hug them or kiss them properly because they were ""contaminated"". When I did kiss and hug them I had to wash my face for 5 minutes at home and wash the clothes separately sometimes.

The worst part started after a few years after moving from home. I started to think about this man during the day. I don't know why. He just popped into my head. What would he think of what I'm doing? I imagined him criticizing me. It started happening more and more frequently.

His name started to pop up in my head as well. So I started saying random words in my head to counter it.

This became constant.

I also had paranoid thoughts of him as well. What if he hated me so much, that he would actively try to do something to hurt me?

At around this time, we decided with my best friend that we would start a relationship. I remember after we agreed to start a relationship I started having thoughts about the man and this made me fucking sad. I couldn't 100% enjoy my boyfriend's company. And he was the most important person to me.

On the first night we moved together (I was beyond happy), I had my first violent intrusive thought =this is unrelated to the man, but stilll OCD): ""What if I kill him in my sleep?"" What. I was fucking devastated. Why did I think this? What if I do? Could I do it?

**OCD thoughts do this. They go after the things that are most important to you. And there is NO LOGIC or TRUTH to them.**

I was almost too afraid to go to sleep that night. I kept thinking how I would wake up and he would be be dead and how his parents would cry. Just why.

But I woke up and no one was hurt. OBVIOUSLY. So this thought passed then.

(Later, these thoughts came back at times with intrusive images of hurting him and/or his family.)

(I buried these thoughts deep within myself and did my hardest to deny them. I was not ready to think of myself as a ""monster"" because I loved him more, than anything. I wasn't a monster! They were just intrusive thoughts and that's all. But of course knowing that, you can still feel like hell.)

But then came the time we would be together sexually. (I was afraid of this in advance.)

And yes, the image of the man popped up (next to other evil people from history...). And then kept popping up almost every time we would do something sexual.

I don't know how I kept going. I did 1000000s of mental compulsions to get rid of the images and thoughts and my intimacy suffered for it. I could NOT express myself sexually how I wanted to. I wanted to lose myself to the pleasures of sex but then I had an intrusive violent/sexual thought of the man and so it was ruined. Same with masturbation.

My mental compulsions to get rid of the images/thoughts started to get more and more violent. That was the only way I could calm down mentally.

Of course I started to have thoughts like ""What if I think about him, because I secretly want to"""" - This was the worst- and it was obviously not true.

The last 5 years the intrusive thoughts were constantly there. Violent, sexual, everything.

And I kept thinking of things that I hated about him/were disgusting about him. (He wears glasses sometimes so I started being annoyed by people who wear glasses.)

I even have these compulsions to ""draw the outline of things"". And I can feel my hands wanting to move =this could be a sign of something else.)

At some point my half brothers came over to our apartment.

After that I realized that what they touched and where they sit was contaminated. And then I felt like ""it"" spread to everything in the apartment.

&amp;#x200B;

* **The house**

**From ages 11-20 my childhood was SHIT. I dreaded evenings and especially weekends. I had to take this man being home and making my life hell. I would look at other kids looking forward to the weekends and being with their loving families.**

For me, it was always verbal abuse (sometimes physical as well), emotional blackmail, shouting, cursing and NOISE. 

All I ever wanted from life was f\*cking PEACE AND SILENCE. That's all. 

My mother took my side sometimes but only on the surface. No matter how many times I begged her to leave him and move and CHOOSE ME, she didn't. Even though she was verbally abused too on a regular basis. She cried a lot, so did I. 

She said she didn't want her sons to grow up without a father, like I did. I was sacrificed.

I remember the lowest point was when it was my 15th birthday and we started arguing about something and he came after me and actually said ""I'll kill you"". Even then my mother wouldn't leave. That's all you have to know.

My mother became a traitor to me.

We moved houses 5 times with my boyfriend. I just feel so sorry for him. Our first house was amazing, but we couldn't stay because the rent was too high.

From that point on, it's just downhill. I couldn't find my home/peace in any of the apartments (hellish neighbors/car noises...etc.)

I started getting angrier and more frustrated with life. Depression was getting worse, but I didn't realize this because I was too busy thinking about how I hated living everywhere.

At some point I felt like everything was contaminated.

I started to keep my groin area clenched as a compulsion.

I stopped inviting my brothers over because I didn't want them to touch anything in the apartment (or sit on the toilet...etc.) - This was also because I was paranoid that he would know our address and come over when I was home alone - there was no chance for this, but I couldn't shake these feelings.

I met with my brothers outside somewhere (cinema, park, restaurant...etc.) They didn't understand why they couldn't come over. Obviously I couldn't tell them, so I made up some excuses. I felt like shit.

My mother/family was making everything SO MUCH WORSE in the meanwhile. I cut them off because I couldn't handle how they didn't choose my side in all of this. They acted like there was nothing wrong, while still complaining about him behind his back.

My mother kept telling/asking me to forgive him and go back back home to talk. I never told her just how much they ruined my life. But I hated her so much.

It was like she kept turning a knife in my wounds.

There were multiple boxes in the apartment/house that I wouldn't touch. I kept washing my hands compulsively. I didn't allow my boyfriend to touch certain things that I knew were ""dirty.""

At this point he knew I was ""OCD"" but he didn't know why or how serious it was.

**I was barely present in the last 5 years.** I wasted SO much of my time fearing the dirty items and thinking what I can't touch / dreaming about my future house that is completely clean/ hating the noise neighbors/ cars....etc.

I didn't buy flowers/pillows/things I wanted because I felt like the house didn't deserve it, because it was dirty. I didn't watch my favorite TV shows sometimes.

I had to throw out so many stuff, wasting a LOT of money that could have been used for traveling and other wonderful stuff. I threw out a LOT OF clothes, bags, make up, home decor, small furniture...etc.

I hated touching certain things. I did excessive laundry. I had to clean everything. My hand would sometimes bleed from so much hand washing. -&gt; My hands were always my sensitive points. I would look at how dry/red they were and would always be reminded of my ""condition"". I spent a lot of money on high-end hand creams and even more on laundry stuff/soaps/shower gels/cleaning stuff. SO much wasted money.....

Even my poor cats were ""dirty"". ( I still loved and petted them though, I just couldn't shake the thought).

I developed breath holding OCD for certain triggers and I would do small movements with my face, hands, legs and toes as compulsions to certain thoughts.

I couldn't touch the TV remote without having to wash my hands afterwards.

At a certain point, I started hating cars so much for being (noisy and annoying) that I had to loudly cuss at every car that went by my house. After that it was every human being. ( I genuinely don't know how my boyfriend didn't send me to a psych ward or broke up with me.)

Right now I'm at a point, where everything is my house is dirty but I accepted it, because I'm mentally checked out.

I always liked things in my environment **very clean and neat**, but my OCD feelings were stronger and I ended up having a mess in a lot of places in my house. (I didn't want to touch/mix certain areas so things piled up after a while.) 

&amp;#x200B;

This was slowly killing me.

It became beyond exhausting so I just gave up.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate it so much. It's fucking unfair. I didn't do anything to deserve this. I was hurt and abused and then \*I\* have to deal with this mental illness as well. 

Life is fucking unfair.

**But the worst part of it is that there might be a solution and you don't even know it.**

**There WAS a cure/treatment. I just didn't know about it, so I kept suffering.**

There are hundreds of other things, but I can't write everything down. 

I didn't do a LOT of things I could have possibly wanted because of my anxiety and OCD.

(A few years ago I got addicted to smutty manga. I only realize now that I'm addicted. It gave me such a strong sense of happiness and escapism from my life that it was hard not to get hooked on it completely. This was also a bad thing, because reading these became my whole life and I made a lot of decisions that were VERY unhealthy.

Mindless porn does a lot of horrible things to your brain chemistry, please be reasonable with it.)

Now to more symptoms: I hate words that sound like his name/has the same first letter. I have mental compulsions to ""clean them"" from my brain. I hate the things/food the he likes. I can barely go to the places/town that are near the house I was in high school.

(BTW he is now checked in a mental hospital for clinical depression and my mom is thinking about leaving him. My poor little brothers are suffering greatly from their home situation. This is very ironic and cruel because.....)

&amp;#x200B;

**...now.** ***THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART, PLEASE READ!!! ---------------------------------------------------------------***

I'm utterly broken and fucked up in my head. I had a DPDR episode in January after a very stressful period that is closely related my OCD, I completely dissociated and I can't come back to reality.

MY BRAIN COULDN'T HANDLE THE DISCONNECT. I wanted to have a beautiful, clean, lovely HOME and LIFE where I feel safe vs. my ""dirty"", sad home and life without a soul, that reminds me how my life went to shit. ***(Please read the science about this. If there is a big enough gap between your actual NEEDS and between what your reality is for a long enough time, you can actually ""break your brain"". It's very fucking serious.)***

I'm not gonna list the symptoms, but just know it's bad. I'm fucking suffering in hell.

I lost my sense of reality and self. I'm just going for the sake of my loved ones.

There are some utterly f\*cked and unfathomable existential OCD thoughts and loops stuck in my head.

Next to the DPDR symptoms that are torturing me, all day I keep thinking about how I wasted the last 15 years (but mostly 5 years with my boyfriend. I love him so much, this causes me the most suffering.)

It's eating me. I have so many regrets. I wish I could go back, but I can't. 

I'm just so sad, that I didn't ask for help with all of this. My c-ptsd and OCD. And possibly other mental illnesses I have.

**I wish I came across something like this post 5 or 10 years ago. My life would be different now.**

DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID. PLEASE GET HELP. You don't have to live with even 1 OCD thought. It's useless. Find a certified OCD specialist. Do ERP. Make the thoughts quiet. Make the images disappear.

Don't be a bad example like me.

Life is so beautiful with a clear head and . The opportunities are endless.

**OCD IS FULLY TREATABLE SO IT NEVER COMES BACK. And even if it comes back, you can make it 80/90/95%. You can live with that!**

**If you are someone / see someone that is showing signs of OCD (even small ones!!!) please make them read this. THE SOONER YOU START TREATING OCD, THE BETTER.**

***There are even medications and vitamins you can take that work miracles.***

Don't waste even 5 minutes more on this shitty mental illness. Get a therapist. Work through your traumas and do ERP. You will beat this. You CAN beat this.

You deserve a happy, healthy life. You deserve happy, healthy thoughts.

**PLEASE DON'T PROCRASTINATE when it comes to OCD.** It will keep getting nastier. It spreads if you have an anxious mind. DON'T let that happen. 

**Don't go beyond a point of no return.**

This is the first and last time I write this down, so you can learn from my life story and hopefully reverse/PREVENT the damage. PLEASE.

No one deserves OCD, but I believe that all of you can beat it and don't waste your life on this. 

Sending you lots of love and strength. Don't EVER give up. (And please donate to an OCD charity if you can afford to.)

OCD,"Ever since the end of December I’ve been completely mentally fucked. It never ends. All the bad things from the past haunt me and I feel like they can’t be forgiven. Any moment of happiness I get is quickly ruined by these thoughts reminding me that I’m actually a fucked up person who deserves to suffer. 

I’m supposed to be getting OCD therapy from my university in a few weeks but it feels so long and I feel like it’s just an excuse for what I’ve done. The fact that I can’t undo the past gives me so much panic and I feel like I’ve ruined my life. 

Please someone tell me does it ever stop. It has to stop. It’s ruining my life. If it’s not the past then it’s the future I worry about. Please make it stop.",Am I going to be okay?
OCD,"You are not your feelings.

People wrongly identify with their feelings. They feel anxious, so they tell themselves a story, ‘I’m anxious, I have anxiety.’ This leads to living a life in which we’re trying to avoid certain feelings or chasing others.

We reach a state of calm. Then we start to think about how to hold on to it. How to stay in this state forever. Then the calm is gone and we’re anxious again. 

Understand: Your feelings are impermanent. You are meant to feel. Emotions exist so that we can feel them, the full range. Happy, sad, bored, discontent.

Stop thinking about your feelings as a permanent state and realize you have the power to change it.

When you think of Mike Tyson, ‘Iron Mike,’ ‘The Baddest Man on the Planet.’ A career record of 50-6, 44 knockouts, arrested more than 30 times before he was 13. You don’t think of someone who felt a lot of fear. 

It’s hard to imagine him [in tears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKjK95aRrhc) before a fight. Pacing around outside crying and overcome by anxiety and fear. Tyson’s trainer and adopted father, Cus D’Amato would say, “The hero and the coward both feel the same thing, but the hero uses his fear.” 

Tyson felt fear, it was a feeling he had. But then he moved forward. After those tears is a fight that was stopped in his favor after about 35 seconds. Thoughts, emotions, feelings. They’re like clouds, they come and go. Not here forever. Not gone forever. 

In ***The Wisdom of Insecurity***, Alan Watts explains that if, “we are to be fully human and fully alive and aware, it seems that we must be willing to suffer for our pleasures.”

If you never want to feel sad. You’ll never feel happy. If you never want to feel anxious, you won’t know contentment. If you’ve never had a bad day, you won’t recognize a great one. The alternative to feeling is numbness. It’s bland, mediocre and average. It’s half alive.  

You can’t control your feelings, but you can control how you react to them. Accept that your feelings are impermanent. They come and go. They’re feelings, not a life sentence. ",Reminder: You Are Not Your Feelings

OCD,"I’m not 100% sure if I have OCD, and I haven’t been in an abusive relationship, but this is the closest comparison in my opinion

The way they constantly make me doubt my experiences, my very being, and my sense of who and what I am. The way they make me feel like a monster. The way they creep into things I enjoy doing and thinking about making them hard to leave. The way they sometimes make me doubt whether or not they’re intrusive thoughts at all (and that instead, what’s true about me is the opposite of how I see myself). It’s almost to the point that I might have intrusive thoughts about my intrusive thoughts (e.g. whether so many things I realized about myself, sexuality for instance, were just intrusive thoughts all along, or if I really am what I feel like I am. I’m a bi guy with a preference for men, for context). The way they suck the joy out of everything I love doing and thinking about.

I feel like I have to do a reality check every so often when these thoughts get too intrusive.

It gets so tiring sometimes. I want to feel like myself again. I want to enjoy the things I enjoy, talking to friends, living my life, thinking about and imagining sex and love, without these thoughts infecting everything like acid spilling on everything. To the point where I can’t even enjoy the touch of my own body without these thoughts flashing in my mind like a TV suddenly switching to another channel.

OCD,"Hi there first time posting here.

I have struggled with pure-O OCD and anxiety for most of my life. I’ve seen counselors for the past several years, and that helped me manage some of my BIG phobias and intrusive thoughts, but I’m still really struggling. I also recently went through a miscarriage that was really traumatic and caused some depression and lack of motivation.

A psychiatrist prescribed Zoloft to help with my OCD and social anxiety, but I’ve always had intrusive thoughts and aversions to taking medications- however, I really really want to try anything that can help relieve my mental anguish and frustration with my thoughts.

When I try to calmly and respectfully remind him of what he’s doing while he’s doing it, (mostly just by saying “Baby....” )he snaps at me and says hurtful things. I’m really at a loss.

Not as important but I feel like my already shitty life has been high jacked and what’s worse is that I allow it. It takes him up to 8-9 hours to get ready after keeping us both up all night until 6-7 am and not getting up until noon, sometimes4-5. All of my hygiene products, a lot of my clothing, devices, appliances are used up and or broken at a ridiculous speed- without consideration towards the fact that I need to use it too.

OCD,"Does anyone know if there is a link between Celebrity Worship Syndrome (which is a form of obsessive addiction disorder, I believe I read)  and obsessive compulsive disorder?

I have been diagnosed with OCD but I also tend to go through these weird phases of obsessing over a celebrity or sometimes a subject or something.  

For example, my newest one is Marilyn Manson, I have been obsessively listening to his music and watching interviews with him and I may buy his autobiography book and have been thinking about his music, voice, personality, makeup, the allegations against him and stuff.  I've experienced this before with other celebrities as well.  When I was younger I had it REALLY bad when I was about 12 over some dude from CSI: Miami. Lol.

Thankfully now mine usually go through shorter phases.  

It also is sometimes a subject or movie like.. recently I had an obsession with Titanic the movie and literally would keep watching it over and over again and then started to read about the actual Titanic and books about it and stuff.  Changed my phone wallpaper to the Titanic, etc. and I seem to have moved on from that for the most part.

I've been searching for some kind of supplements for OCD (intrusive thoughts) and found some contraindications (the psychiatrists in my country 🇧🇷 don't usually indicates it, some only talk about vitamin D and I also view an video that the doctor doesn't recomends cause could imbalance the rest of hormones - when you takes tritophane).

OCD,"okay, so honestly my intrusive thoughts have been a lot better lately but obviously when you have nothing to obsess about the OCD goes back and finds things that i’ve since worked through and i have been able to surpass the guilt and all of it and prove to myself that i am not my thoughts but i’ve been thinking and like, i don’t like the idea that i’ve done things that are bad. and i’ve had all these thoughts. (i saw someone else post about this as well) and it’s really bothering me and it makes me feel like i’m not worth living. like i have this worry that maybe i cheated on someone but i don’t think i did, but i can’t remember the timelines properly. and it’s worrying me. and i feel like i told my boyfriend i didn’t talk to people before we were dating and i don’t think that’s true either but the thing is i can’t remember but i don’t wanna be a bad person i’m so scared i hate feeling guilty and i feel like i have to do something to get rid of all these feelings but i don’t know what to do. like i know either way, i didn’t cheat on him cause like we weren’t dating but i feel guilty that i possibly talked or flirted with people online before that but i can’t remember. but the uncertainty of it is killing me. 

secondly, there was something that happened when i was a child with this other little girl i knew at the time (i think she was a year or two younger but we were both less than 10) but regardless i feel like i did something bad to her and i can’t remember exactly, and i remember asking her to have sex with me, but i remember us just laying down naked and that was it, but i don’t know if i’m making this up or this actually happened but i can’t ask them. and i don’t wanna tell people because what if i did do that and i traumatized her for life? i’m scared but i am also worried theres maybe more that i’m NOT remembering. and like ugh. i’m also scared because i know that like all of these things have made me a bad person because now i’m not like morally clean which i don’t like. i don’t like that i’ve ever thought or done bad things.

EDIT: I don’t know how to go about it because usually like confessing my thoughts and actions relieves the anxiety temporarily but i can’t take back the things i’ve done or thought or said and the stuff i don’t know about like if there’s things i can’t remember that i did and i’m also stressed because maybe i’m being dramatic and what if i’m making this entire thing up for attention (i don’t think i am but again, OCD brain) and i’m just having a breakdown so thank you if you read this far)",worried that i’m not morally a good person

my boyfriend is 19 now. him and his friend have always been on good terms, but my ocd just wants to call my him a pedophile or a groomer now for no reason. their relationship was just casual and had no force/abusive tendencies, and he clearly regrets it, so i don’t get why my ocd wants to paint this awful picture of him. it’s driving me insane. i don’t wanna lose him over something like this.",ocd telling me that my boyfriend’s a pedophile

OCD,"I forgot something hugely important today, basically it was an assignment where I had to critique someone else's work.

I forgot it completely, I knew it was going to happen last week, and I forgot it.

I know that it's because of ADHD, I know it's not that important in life, but I feel like I just killed someone.

I mean, this is someone else's art, their work that they put time and effort into and they loved and it was clearly so important to them. I wanted to say things about it, I wanted to discuss it, but I fucking forgot. I killed their time and when I apologized they said that it was cool and thanked me?

How? How the fuck can they just blow this off, how the fuck? I'm a fucking horrible, narcissistic piece of shit, I treated their work like it wasn't worth the ten minutes of time it would take to me to read and write a solid critique, and they just say that it's fine?

I know that the reason I'm writing this is becuase my OCD is seeking reassurance, or maybe punishment. I know that the only reason I could ever actually be this sorry is because I really just want to excuse this on my mental illnesses and shove the responsibility onto my broken brain. I am not this genuine, no one is, and I know that by even saying this it's just me begging for someone to say that I am.

So why the fuck is it that the only time in the past two years that I've been able to cry over anything has been when I fucked something up for someone? I genuinely feel so horrible, it just proves why I need OCD, so that I can be punished for the weight of how horrible I am. I need my brain to keep hurting me, because I keep hurting other people through blind ignorance and stupidity. I need OCD to keep me in check, because I just wander through life, without a care in the world, and fuck everything up around me unless I am managed. I need this mental illness to manage me, to make sure that I never hurt anyone like this again.

I'm utterly fucked up, and everyone else is so fucking beautiful. They're all so creative, wonderful, kind, thoughtful. They truly are, in so many ways, perfect. But I keep ruining things for them, conversations, art, time, I take it all and rape it with my shitty shitty brain.

I don't even know what this is anymore. Public flagellation or attention seeking or whatever. But I just want to say something.

I wish I could just be a human being with a good brain that helped people. I always wish I was them, but instead I'm me.",Apologizing isn't enough
OCD,"When I get intrusive thoughts I just say “I’m probably just a pedophile so it doesn’t even matter anymore” is this acceptance or what’s happening I’m confused, I don’t get anxiety from this",POCD Sorta convinced myself that I am a pedophile?
OCD,"While it is more common that OCD is based on anxiety, which I also have, I think I do also have it with anger. I keep checking on these thoughts to see if it still makes me angry and analyze it to the core how much and why it made me so angry etc etc... this ofc keeps the anger alive. I wake up in the morning and the first thing I do is checking on the thought. Whenever I have an episode like this, then all I would see is this stupid situation or this person. All day long. 24/7. While other people just move on from things, I would be stuck on it for weeks or even months... it's a total mindfuck. 

The anger then results in anxiety when I'm trying to sleep at night, because I'm subconsciously probably scared to experienced such devastating anger again.",I obsess over situations or people that make me angry
OCD,"on snapchat, someone i follow shared a go fund me for a kid who had been horrifically bullied due to his race. i won’t name specifically what happened because it could be potentially triggering for some people, as it was for me. i had clicked on the go fund me link just to see what it was and it gave a pretty graphic description of what happened to this kid, and how the family needed money for his therapy, as well as bringing awareness to the situation. i instantly felt terrible for him, as the things that happened were so degrading and horrible, but it also triggered me so badly and now i cant stop thinking about it. i’m doing compulsions like crazy. also had a really shitty day so this is pretty much the icing on the cake :( does anybody else ever get triggered seeing upsetting stories in the news or on social media?",intrusive thought will not leave my head from reading a story online
OCD,"Uncertain Life &gt;&gt; A Song By Me

This uncertain life, I need to get used to uncertain life,

To put it in terms that a person can understand,

It's a lifestyle that prides itself on uncertainness,

That means not knowing in terms of emotions ex-actly,

If what you're feeling is worth demand,

Those without issues might not get the memo,

So let's put it into economic terms again,

&amp;#x200B;

It's like not having a job and not knowing where your next paycheck is,

Rationally, to find certainty, you'd try to get hired for paying shifts,

But you can't do it, cause you'll get fired soon, and be back ruminating,

So to counteract the effects, you stay unemployed

Without a clue as to how to make ends meet,

And you sit there, doing whatever you please, you were afraid to buy a car,

Because you didn't have the money to cover such high a charge,

But you take out the loan with no intent to work to supply the cost,

You don't have the cash, but you buy the car,

Likely causing worries as to how you'll pay for the car,

Brain keeps saying to go work a job, you say nah,

And go buy a plane, fly the plane, deny your brain,

Your brain saying to combine your change

Or get a job at least, To provide sustainment,

You say no, and go buy a boat,

&amp;#x200B;

The uncertain life, it's the kind of hard-working life, that rich people have,

Where you don't need to work,

You keep relaxation and complacency w thoughts,

&amp;#x200B;

The uncertain life, why did I decide on the uncertain life?

Cause prior to this, I had lived a worthless life,

Went from a pray and worship life to a tell others to pray and worship life,

Spent all day checking to make sure my actions hadn't led to a person dying,

A compulsion life, a can't walk next to minors cause my mind wants me to

touch the child,

A scrupulosity life, a religious focused life, a guilty confession controlling life,

A depressed injured and hurting life,

all-cause I was too interested in living the certain life,

A quote on quote perfect life, then I saw the worldly life,

A push to decide before maturity what kind of course in life,

Get the joke? My whole life for college courses time,

Get a job, provide security and a sureness life,

Girls never liked me, short king life,

Till one girl and I can't be certain I like her cause my

Perverted mind? But maybe second-hand benefits,

Aren't all worthless highs,

Maybe the uncertain life can help me to figure out the hurt in life,

And OCD led me to a philosophy of the perfect kind,

And I ain't even sure the uncertain life is the preferred life,

But it's mine so long as I wish to stop my burning mind,

My burdens climb so long as I strive for a certain life,

So goodbye, and say hi, to the uncertain life.",Uncertain Life &gt;&gt; A Song
OCD,"First of all, thanks, guys for all your support on my last post. I’m now over the 24 hour period without compulsions and here’s how it’s gone:

- It was difficult. Really difficult. Tear inducingly difficult. There are a few times where I thought I should give up and I’d get a buzz on my phone from this supportive community, showing me someone egging me on. It was really appreciated and helped me get through.

- It is possible to just stop compulsions and it takes humongous effort. I was knackered by about 8pm, and could barely stay awake. I’m assuming this was mental exhaustion. However, after not doing compulsions, you forget what the obsessions were about after a few minutes. Then it makes it easier to continue after.

- I’m continuing the fight and will let you know. Feeling the path to a bit of clarity is opening up.

Thank you all, and here’s to a quiet mind.",24 hour update.

OCD,"Hey there, I hate how I sound like a drug addict desperately clinging onto a psychoactive substance, but hopefully knowing how severe OCD can be you can understand where I am coming from.

I suffered with severe anxiety and pure O OCD my entire life, in fact at one point I became agoraphobic due to fear of potentially harming others. Whenever I heard a high profile crime had happened I’d instantly wonder if I had commited it myself. Furthermore I have also dealt with false memories, extreme hypochondriasis and severe performance anxiety that almost got me dropping out of school. 

About two years ago my family and I decided it was time to look into pharmacological help. At first I was prescribed Lexapro, which didn’t work and gave me bad anhedonia and avolition so I had to switch to Zoloft. I’ve been taking it for about a year at 200mg and it works amazingly both for my OCD as well as my depressive tendencies. For the first time in my life I have been happy and can see the irrationality of my intrusive thoughts. 

However, my psychiatrist thinks it’s time to start tapering off and has lowered my dosage to 150mg instead and wants me to be off medication by the summer. When she first said so I didn’t think much of it considering I feel okay right now, but the truth is this dosage decrease for the past 12 days has shown me that the Zoloft is the very reason I am okay. Don’t get me wrong, I have benefited a lot from therapy and have more coping mechanisms now than I had two years ago, but the real game changer and anti-obsessional force has indeed been fhe Zoloft.

I know it’s not up to me to decide and I should trust my therapist, but I really really want to keep taking it. On Zoloft at least I have some quality of life. I barely have any side effects and it’s working so well. She said most people normally took it for 1-2 years, but what harm could there be in being on it for longer? Of course I know that I can obviously go back on medication, but what if it doesnt work the second time around or even if it does why do I have to go through the whole tapering up process again? It makes no sense to me and although I know this is something I should be discussing with my doctor (I will on our next appointment btw) I would like to hear your take. Has anyone else been on long-term medication?",My doctor wants me to start tapering off my Zoloft but I don’t want to

OCD,"I have a 5 month old Chocolate Lab, and I'm in grad school right now so with everything I work from home. And I know realistically most people crate their dogs for work, but every time I do, I panic and worry that I'm neglecting him and mistreating him, or that I'll damage him by having him in there when I'm trying to work. It's literally making me sick to my stomach. And I get frustrated and overwhelmed really easily, worrying that he'll choke on whatever (which is a realistic worry) he's got in his mouth, or that somehow I'll exercise him wrong and give him 'bloat', or that I'm just hurting him somehow.

OCD,"i can't help feeling miserable, sad, discouraged, tired ... 

i started taking medication and I was diagnosed with OCD but nothing changes, nothing improves.  

what disturbs me now is: whenever I get aroused, I get a shivering or goosebump feeling or something in my legs. 

since i noticed this, i spend hours and days paying full attention to my legs and if i feel anything there, i already imagine it is arousal. 

today in the morning my dog ​​touched my rib, i was desperate and soon i paid attention to my legs again and i felt like a fur had lifted.  

I had that same feeling other times (standing still, paying attention to myself, scratching my head, aroused, when i am feeling anxious, lying doing nothing, sitting doing nothing while watching my class, so many times) 

other than that it has the fact that when i feel aroused, i feel many things that i didn’t feel today in the morning, it was just that sensation in my legs that happens several times

OCD,"I’m so tired. My ocd and health anxiety have skyrocketed the past two months. I can’t stop thinking about having a terminal illness or contracting Covid. Everything in my mind is contaminated somehow. My skin is so dry from constant hand washing. I feel like I’m always on edge and can never fully relax. 

Working from home makes this worse too. I only interact with people if it’s in a meeting. I can barely even focus on my work now. And my free time is occupied with these thoughts so I don’t get to relax. 

So I think I need to go cold turkey. No more Reddit after this because I go on health anxiety forums and discover new diseases to worry about. No more googling for reassurance because it also just makes my anxiety worse. No more constant hand washing, no more avoiding items that I think I contaminated. And no more of my compulsions like praying before bed, checking my stove, and just other nonsense beliefs.

OCD,"Hey all, so I think I may have made a post about this before but I honestly can’t remember. I’ve had what I thought is OCD and definitely anxiety for a while now, (haven’t got tested for ocd)and I think it started shortly before or after my mother died a few years ago. I’ve had many different obsessions, some include:

Fear of violence: I would have intrusive thoughts and ruminate about hurting people, usually loved ones in violent manners, this has seemingly gone away but usually my obsessions come and go 

Fear of being homosexual: I would worry and have intrusive thoughts about being attracted to the opposite sex, and often check to make sure I wasn’t. This one was the least difficult to deal with I would say, as if I saw an attractive woman I’d feel less inclined to give into these thoughts. I don’t have anything against people with different sexual attractions, nor is it my fear. it’s just a fear I have of my OWN sexuality.

Fear of being a pedophile: I would worry and have intrusive thoughts about being attracted to children, though I’d never do something like this once again it’s something that was intrusive and wouldn’t leave me alone. This was very stressful to deal with and made me feel evil. I remember one time I had to bathe my baby cousin and I was uncomfortable because those thoughts kept pinging me in my mind, but nonetheless I was fine and didn’t worry about it as I was doing so.

Obsession with looks: I’m obsessed with facial features and attractions, whenever I see a person that has a feature I think is attractive, I think to myself “why couldn’t I look like that?” As well as many other things, I think about how long their chin is, how far apart their eyes are, cheekbones etc.

A big one I struggle with *CURRENTLY*, is cleaning/contamination OCD: since the pandemic has started, I’ve been extra cautious about covid and sanitation. Previously I didn’t care as much, but now every time we leave the house and come back, I whipe my phone and keys and other things. This sounds normal, but then it transitions into me whiping everything I brush my jacket on while walking past, spraying everything my body may have touched. If I touch a tiny part of my skin on a doorknob without washing my hands or showering prior to returning home, or something of that sort, I’ll spray my skin (which can’t be good for me), and whatever I touched.. I spray after myself every time I do laundry and put my dirty clothes in there. My father does not take covid seriously, so every time he comes home I whipe down everything he’s touched, and it leads to me washing my hands definitely 20+ times a day, definitely more than that. My hands quite literally look like alligator skin, and are are cracked, chafed, and very dry. I put lotion on but this doesn’t help when you keep removing it by washing over 20 times. and I’m also afraid of my own bodily fluids. Anytime I use the bathroom, I have to whipe everything that I’ve touched, and sometimes things I haven’t touched just to make sure that I don’t “infect” my sisters with urine that also use the bathroom, as well as myself. It sometimes takes and hour + to disinfect to my satisfaction, and this annoys my sisters as they have to hunt for whipes and disinfectants, I usually pay for them and if I could drive (I don’t have a license yet,), I would pick them up myself rather than cashapping them everytime, as if would make me feel a lot better. I feel bad for doing this, but I would spend all day worrying if I did not. Just yesterday, I had felt like the top of my dresser was contaminated, and I touched it. I tried to resist the urge to disinfect my whole room, and I had been anxious all day worrying if I caught covid when in reality I’ll most likely be fine. I’m worried about infecting others as well as myself when it comes to covid. 

Pregnancy OCD: I’m a teenager, so I masturbate. I’m not ashamed of it, but every time I do this, I wash my hands more than once, sometimes up to four times, even if I don’t get anything on my hands. and I whipe down everything I touch (again, some things I haven’t touched), and spray them as there are women in the house and while I know it’s technically impossible for them to, I’m afraid that my sperm can get them pregnant. If I do not properly sanitize, I spend days, sometimes weeks worrying about things like. “Are they acting weird now all of a sudden?”, “did I get any on my hands?”, “I’m pretty sure it had been 30 or so minutes, so no sperm can survive.” This has occurred around the same time as my contamination ocd and it may go hand in hand I’m not sure.  The semen itself does not scare me, but infecting other people with it does. 

I also repeat phrases over periodically throughout the day in my head: I repeat certain things I hear, or things I say in my mind. This doesn’t affect me negatively I don’t think, but it’s annoying and I wish it would stop. It’s just odd to be going about my day and then hear some random word I keep repeating again, it’s ridiculous.

I’m also obsessed with music and the artists that make it: I’ve always loved music, and when I learn of an artist that I really like, I research everything I can about them. I’ve recently (over this year) started listening to Michael Jackson (along with the Jackson 5), Marvin Gaye, 2pac, Jim Morrison (the doors), and these are mostly what I focus on. I know things like certain events they went to, etc just a whole bunch of unimportant things that I find cool. I’ve watched Michael Jackson dance, and I mimic his dance moves a lot. I have many songs by each. I often listen to their songs on repeat, and identify little new sounds I hear each time I listen. These artists that I like I often find that I identify with a lot. For instance, Marvin Gaye, Jim Morrison and  Michael Jackson did not have a strong relationship with their fathers, neither do I and perhaps that is part of the reason why I gravitate towards them. I do like music a lot and listen to a lot of genres, mostly older stuff, 60’s-2000’s, reggae, soul, disco, rock/blues, r&amp;b, but I like a lot of rap and new age pop also.



I’ve also struggled with anger issues in the past after my mom died, but I don’t have this issue anymore. I would hit and break things and scream but luckily that shit is over with, as I was not in the position to replace any of it.

I’m also usually very stressed and anxious. I’m anxious whenever I have to go somewhere with people, but the minute I get there and see them I’m lively and energized and I more than usually have a lot of fun. I hesitated to call it social anxiety, seeing as how once I’m around people I’m no longer anxious, but maybe the anxiety is the buildup to getting there rather than actually talking to them. I’ve never been the awkward type and I get along with people well.

I’m often very self-critical, about the way I look and how other people perceive me. I often criticize myself but this may be more of a teenage confidence issue.

Other than all of this, I’m a pretty normal kid for my age. I got a good set of friends, my sisters basically step up as parents, and they do a better job than my parents did. I do well In school, and I’m just tryna be the best me I can. I feel like the outside me is normal to other people, when the inner me is troubled. Honestly idk, I’m just tired af. I want it all to end. My sisters are constantly upset with me solely because I use too much disinfectant, I pay for it but they hate hunting for it at stores as it’s often difficult to find. That’s my main problem right now is contamination, but the other problems are there also. I’ve never gotten tested, or medicated and my family said that I don’t need to. I’m pretty sure one of my sisters has it also, and we’re almost IDENTICAL in just about everything we like/humor/taste etc. she usually tells me that I just need to work on it, but I don’t know how.

Anyways, this was all just a rant/cry for help and I hope someone has tips for anything I’ve said above. I’m sure I’ve left stuff out but honestly fuck it Bc this shit took way too damn long to write lmao. I’d love to hear what y’all have to say.","Putting myself out there, I think I’m finally at wit’s end. [M,16] [long rant]"

OCD,"Before OCD, I was relaxed. I didn't care about so much. I lived just like everyone else.

I accepted uncertainty. I lived with questions. Some even had me curious.

Now I feel like a toddler. The simplest things give me anxiety like studying, improving myself, reading, work etc. I start asking myself questions and get completely stressed out. I deal with a lot of existential and moral OCD.

I don't really work anymore. I haven't studied for months. I hide and play games or watch TV inside to avoid life. To avoid responsibility. To avoid even the things I used to love to do. Please believe me, I don't want to. I do it to hide from the world. To protect myself from myself.

I fantasize about death a lot. I'm not planning on killing myself but I think about it A LOT. I'm **not** suicidal but I just really look forward to my life ending. The blankness. The peace. The carelessness. I almost crave it. However I have no plans to kill myself and I don't want anyone to think I do.

I don't want children a family or a gf. I'm not even close to being able to be ok with that.

However, I don't want anyone to think you can't have those things with OCD. You **absolutely** can and if that's what you want I'm really happy for you. I really really am. It's just not for me. I don't want it to be.

OCD,"I've been having a really tough time with contamination theme for the past month or so, specifically to do with HPV the type of virus that causes all kinds of warts.

I've been disinfecting things from the store washing my hands obsessively etc due to the nature of the virus being very resilient and lasting on objects for a long time relatively speaking as well as being very common. 

I've spent many hours daily obsessing and compulsing over this for the last month. 

Well I go in to get a haircut and just as she is finishing I noticed she has a wart on the knuckle of her middle finger on her right hand. Not only that but as I was noticing this she very lightly but definitively grazed my forehead with that knuckle. this was already near the end of the haircut if I had noticed at the start I would have noped the f*** out of there immediately.

As soon as I got out of there I went home in a panic and hopped in a shower and scrubbed myself down with soap and water for nearly an hour. I even went so far as to put bleach on my skin where she touched my face and on several other spots where I had scratches or open wound from shaving etc. 

I can't believe this actually happened to be in the middle of an obsession over warts only to get the one f****** hairdresser in town with a goddamn wart on her hand. 

My whole body feels contaminated now and warts take a very long time to show themselves if I did become infected the uncertainty of it all is going to drive me insane for many many months. 

I'm not really sure what I'm going to do but I feel absolutely disgusting.

OCD,"Hello, my psychiatrist recently said I likely have OCD and I agree. I have a few tics that I’ve been doing for awhile. Mainly revolving around feeling ‘equal’ in some regards. One big problem I’ve had recently is I’ve been tightening muscles in my chest to completely empty my lungs. Of course it’s not actually my lungs that I’m messing with it’s just my muscles being flexed. The problem is I do that hundreds of times and day and DAMN my chest is sore and that causes anxiety and panic attacks. So.. is there anything I can do here? Is my only option medication? I do it without thinking. I do it even when I’m actively trying to discourage it.

OCD,I obsess over past mistakes and find it very difficult to accept the fact that I can't be 100% morally perfect and I can't go back and change morally questionable things I have done. This really eats me up inside because of my ocd and I feel like I'm tainted and like I need to start over. It's really hard to do ERP when the mere thought of me being capable of doing something bad makes me suicidal. If anyone can relate I'd like to know I'm not alone in this.,I think I have an obsession with moral purity
OCD,"I’ve pondered for a while that I may have ADHD. I went to the doctor and he asked some basic questions and quickly ruled it out, but I know I’m not what people see as ‘normal’.

Let me delve into this a bit deeper and explain how my brain works...
So this is something I’ve been having a tough time with all my life, I’m fully aware I do these things but I CANNOT stop my mind ticking wildly. I find a new hobby or a new subject or a new movie saga or franchise and I OBSESS! I’m 25, almost 26 and my most recent obsession is subscription boxer shorts ‍♂️, my last obsession was powdered energy drinks. I find something I like and my brain wants as much of it as I can get. I used to collect lightsabers and pop vinyls and then one day my mind is clear and I no longer want them. I sell up. I find something else I invest my everything into and then I just one day no longer care. I built my own pc and I was obsessed with making it look pretty and putting rgb everywhere, then my friend got a gaming laptop and I’ve needed a laptop for work, so I sold my pride and joy pc and bought a gaming laptop. It’s tiring. I was getting something delivered and cause it didn’t come next day like it was supposed to, I phoned the courier over 15 times on different days to try and get it sooner even though every time I rang, they told me it won’t be possible.

I’m currently taking sertraline for my depression, I lost my brother to suicide and I don’t have a great relationship with my family cause I think they didn’t understand me growing up. I’m quite bright and I always have been as I focus so hard at certain things but I throw it away cause I lose focus eventually. I often get called a wind up, because I can be a handful, but its because I bounce off the walls sometimes. 

I’m irrational when it comes to spending money. I buy things I know I don’t want or need, just to complete the set when I own a part of it, and I’m so satisfied once I’ve got it all, or more so when I almost have it all. Then once I have it, I just don’t care anymore.

I’ve been told it’s called hyper focus and it’s a symptom of ADHD-PI but I just need to know what is making me crazy. It’s putting a strain on my life and it’s making it hard for my fiancée and son at times (she is super patient with me and she is completely understanding, I just want to be better for her).",I thought I may have ADHD but someone a dr said it sounds more like OCD
OCD,"My (32F)partner (28M)was in multiple relationships where he cheated on the person he was with, more specifically with one person. He would feel bad after and swore this last time he wouldn’t cheat (he ended up with the person he kept cheating with). Well she cheated on him, told him he was undesirable due to weight gain, told him he was clingy etc. He tried to keep it going with her but she eventually broke it off. He had a breakdown and eventually we met and started dating a few months later. Fast forward 14 months and I now know WAY more about his past than he ever shared with me because of his social media. Then I found out he was still talking to his ex the entire time. My compulsions a lot come from rumination on his ex. I’m doing therapy and medication for my OCD, but she is a constant fear for me now. He lied to me saying they weren’t talking when they were. And that lie has me trapped in a cycle. Today i just realized I never checked his phone call records just his texts (how I found out). And although he says he has blocked her, I’m terrified they used to talk even more than he let on. It makes no difference really. I know I’m just trying to find certainty that my relationship won’t end, but it’s so hard to let go. Their conversations were benign but I still am so freaked out by them. I’m also struggling because the more I feel I don’t have certainty the more I WANT to leave. Which is backwards of what I want long term. Just pretty down today that I can’t let it go and trust she isn’t coming back.",ROCD I can’t get over my partners past

OCD,"I'm not talking about themes here. I've known that OCD exists for a while, but in the past few years I've been experiencing thought patterns that seem a lot like OCD to me. I've been thinking whether there may have also been some signs in my past, or if maybe what I'm experiencing is something different.

Even as a child there would be specific things that I would have to have a certain way. At some point I started experiencing this desire for tactile symmetry. If I stepped on something with one foot, I would have to step on a similar thing with the other foot, if tapped my left hand fingers on my arm, I would have to do the mirror thing as well. If I touch something with one finger, I also have to touch it with all of the other fingers. I'm no expert on OCD,and from what I often read, it seems that those compulsions or rituals are driven by specific fears? For example ""if I don't do x in this specific way then x will happen"", but I don't have that. It's just a feeling that it has to be like that, I have to have it like this or else I will go out of my mind.

There are other situations where I do experience the ""I have to do x or else y"", even if they're not really correlated, but I'm curios about these other times, when I feel the need to have things that particular way or else I won't be able to go on and there isn't a fear of something specific happening.  Is that something that could fall under OCD? Or is it something different or just something unusual about me?",Does OCD need have to have specific fears?

My teeth hurt and my tongue gets sore but I’m afraid I can’t let go otherwise I’m gonna say something obscene and it’s scary.

My fiance and I have struggled with our mental health this past year, partly due to having a baby and Covid lockdown. We've barely been outside in months and it wrecked havoc on our wellbeing. 


Things hit rock bottom last week when my fiance told me he's been struggling with his OCD for the first time in years. Our internet dropped when he was looking at porn and we've been having issues with it ever since, and because he's under a lot of stress he's convinced himself that people are watching him and his phone is listening to everything he says, so thinks that our internet provider has stopped our connection as they think he's a monster.
He got so worked up over it that he was having panic attacks and non-stop crying for eight hours straight, saying he's terrified he's going to be taken away, until I called his mum and we moved back to hers. We've been staying with her ever since.

He's still convinced that he's going to be taken away. I've tried explaining to him that most people our age watch porn, that doesn't make him a monster or a bad person, it wasn't like he was watching anything illegal. Even though he understands this, he says his OCD is giving him this horrid paranoia and these thoughts won't stop.

I don't know what to do. He can't sleep or eat, he's crying all the time, having panic attacks, and his OCD gets really bad when he's on Instagram because he has to follow lots and lots of pages just to unfollow them straight away. I've tried my absolute best to support him and talk some sense into him, but I struggle with depression/anxiety/PTSD/anorexia myself and rely on him A LOT so now I'm starting to feel like I'm about to have a breakdown too.

OCD,"Okay, so I know this is a compulsion and it is reassurance but I've been so good with not doing this for months so I can treat this as a 'cheat day' almost.

&amp;#x200B;

So last night, I was coming inside for dinner and a member of my family was wearing something less than conservative and walking around. I was walking up the path and my anxiety started going, and when I walked into the house I looked the direction they were walking, and then I think I immediately stopped myself and then sat down, immediately worrying and worrying that I was attracted to this person.

I know I've had problems before where my brain has said 'dont look at, dont look at that, dont look at that', and then I've looked out of impulse, and I don't really remember feeling any attraction etc.

I'm really not 100% sure what's going on or what happened, but there's this little voice in my head that tells me that this time it was a bit different and I wanted to look at them inappropriately, even for a second.

Anyone got any experiences like this, and instead of us treating reassurance seaking as a terrible thing and going 'its ok, its ok', maybe this time we could all share experiences which helped us with this?

OCD,"This is a copy and paste from a post I made on r/mentalhealth a while back that no one saw before I realized it would fit better on here. The thought came into my head I’d say about last summer and I think about it every day. I was born in 2005, I know a lot of people who were born a year before in 2004. For some reason I have gotten a random jealousy because of the year they were born. Like I’ll see something that came out in 2004 like let’s say the Adam Sandler movie 50 First Dates. I absolutely love the movie but some voice in my head tells me “they were alive when this came out and you weren’t”. I think of it as childish and stupid but it won’t go away. It’s even gotten to the year they started school for some odd reason, like 2010 or 2009, I’ll see something else that happened then like another movie for example, Scott Pilgrim vs the World which is my all-time favorite movie, that came out in the Summer of 2010. That same voice says the same thing except it says that they started school and not when they were born. So with those two on top of one another, somehow it’s gotten to any year I think of has that same thought “yeah well they were already in high school when this came out and you weren’t” “they we’re halfway through middle school while you’re stuck in the fifth grade” and so on. As you can see there is a patter with years a certain part of school started, and birthdays. Anyone else ever experienced something like this or at least have an idea of what I could do to help get rid of it. It’s getting to the point where I’ll look back on a memory when I was a little kid and then my mind will be like “your friends were already learning algebra when this happened and you’re just learning your times tables”. 
I’ve been talking to my mom about this and she said first to think of all the innovations that happened the year YOU were born, but then it gets worse because then I start thinking that they were alive in a world before this. Things that have nothing to do with them or things that they don’t even know let alone care about make me feel this way. She then told me that this could be OCD because I’m getting obsessed over certain years and events that happened and it’s taking control of my mind several times a day. If there is anyone out there who can explain what is going on or tell me if this is even OCD or not and/or how to help it please so because this is really starting to drive me up the wall",I don’t know how to explain this but hopefully someone can help me out here.
OCD,"I know this might be a little long but I'd be super grateful if anyone took the time to read this and reply

I'm 16 and I've had intrusive thoughts about children for two months now.
In the beginning i had a bunch of anxiety to the point where i would sometimes start disassociating and all the thoughts disgusted me. But gradually the anxiety and disgust went down.

Now two months later. I'm currently on 50mg setraline a day and on a waiting list for help with an ocd specialist.
Lately I've developed kind of a porn addiction and have been masturbating 3 to 5 times a day for about 3 weeks.
I also do a bunch checking compulsion. I will imagine myself having sex with someone my age and then someone underage to check for arousal, and also the other way around. And I'll look up pictures of someone underage and someone my age to check for attraction.

3 or 4 days ago i was on this girl's instagram page who i find very attractive. (She's also 16) I had been on her page earlier the same day i believe and, had masturbated to a few pics of her. Anyway, i was on her page again and doing my thing and i noticed that she recently had posted a few pics of her as a child. I was already aroused because i was masturbating and decided to do a checking compulsion. So i looked at a pic of her as a child and masturbated while imagining having sex with her. (Yeah i know gross) and i came very close to climaxing so i stopped. It was chocking how fast i almost came compared to the usual stuff i had been masturbating too. After i almost came i went back to the other pics of her as a teen, but after a while (I DON'T REMEMBER AT ALL WHY, I DON'T REMEMBER MY MIND SET) i went back to the picture of her as a child, did the same thing and finished. I don't understand why i did, i am so confused. I felt guilty afterwards but it didn't fully hit until later and i started crying hysterically.

I've always liked girls my age!! I've had multiple crushes and multiple sexual fantasies about girls I've liked!! I don't understand why i did this.

I just feel like I've permanently stained my self image.
What does this mean?? I am so confused. Ever since then I've decided to stop watching porn because i think it has majorly desensitized me to women. I've also since then refused to do any checking compulsion but the intrusive thoughts still bother me. 
I can't believe i did that and it grosses me out remembering i did that. Honestly wtf.

OCD,"So I have been dealing with what we (me and my doctor) think is psychosis. And also OCD? I don’t think I have any compulsiveness at all. Its currently a working diagnosis. So here is what I’m experiencing:

-I have a feeling that people are talking about me and feel a need to stop what ever I’m doing and listen to the conversation to make sure nobody is talking about me

-I check a couple of times shortly after Im done cooking, that I actually turned off the stove

-Thinking about sexual things about my male roommates occasionally(I’m straight)

-Constantly thinking about suicide, even when I’m in a good mood

-Feeling like I smell bad/feeling like people can smell me so I shower everyday and put on a good amount of scented lotion to help mask and wash cloths weekly, sometimes multiple times a week

-Constantly thinking about my mental health and how to get better

OCD,"Hi there, I’ve posted this before but didn’t get a response. So 2 years ago I started using a chat site (similar to Omegle, but just text and photos) to sext online. Most the time I’d skip over the men or get skipped because I’d say I’m a male. And then maybe sometimes get a female and sext, or just sext with a male. 

I never thought anything of it. It wasn’t me. I was anonymous. I just did it at night sometimes instead of or with porn. Wasn’t harming anyone. No one needed to know. Id consider myself a decent looking guy with a confident personality so I never felt I needed it. It was just an escape. And I feel very loved from those around me and I love everyone around me.

Anyway so all was fine and life had been very good lately. Anyway my OCD latched onto an obsession on Thursday. My OCD formed an obsession, ‘so you may positively impact a certain amount of people but that’s low compared to the amount of interactions with humans that were just ‘M or F? M okay *skips chat ’ while i looked for someone to sext. So I felt how could I define myself by my positive interactions with people if it’s less than that of just shallow quick weird ones. 

My OCD also formed a second thought. That all these interactions were somehow a sexual experience. And even tho I’m somewhat sexual conservative in real life (as in my kinks are pretty straight forward), that I’m now terrible. And that statistically I suck. And that even if I have great sex 100 times. I have probably thousands of these skip chat interactions with people while I jerked off. 

I’m having a mental breakdown and am in the process of getting help. But I feel ruined forever and forever. I want to get better for my loved ones. Btw I’m don’t go on this site anymore.

\- ""revising"" my social interactions, making edits in my head to things I did that I perceive to be bad

\- practicing socially acceptable behavior by pretending I have an audience at all times

OCD,"Hi OCD community,  


I have sessions on OCD (as a younger kid it was more compulsion, now it is tending more towards obsession.  


There are several instances, but today I would discuss an interesting one.  
In a discussion, I say something (ie. one child bumped into the other because of pulling a toy). Seconds later I come with a better explanation of the situation (ie. the first child did not bump because of pulling the toy, but because it ran towards the toy hold by the second child).  
Sometimes I do correct myself. Sometimes I don't, and then start ruminating about it.  
These corrections are minimal, and I suppose not that important to the recipient.  
Nonetheless I start ruminating about it, and sometimes hold myself back not to correct myself,  
but sometimes do need (even **several hours after the conversation**) to correct myself.  


Even though these changes are minute, and are not that important to the discussion (ie. both kids bumped into each other and hurt themselves, that is the main point, not how it exactly happened), I tend to ruminate about it and have the urge to correcty myself.",Changing minute details in a conversation - even hours after it

OCD,"Hi! I was talking to a friend who was recently diagnosed with OCD and was prescribed Prozac...I've been thinking about going on medication the past couple years to treat my anxiety/depression but after talking to my friend I'm wondering if what I actually have is OCD. I struggle with symptoms like intrusive and unwanted thoughts that cause intense anxiety and distress because I ruminate and obsess over them. Oftentimes they are health related fears or fears of doing something out of character or a general mistrust of myself and my feelings towards things. Even when I logically know the feeling is wrong, these thoughts can spiral out of control and feel extremely overwhelming and dire. The thoughts really destabilize my mood and can be debilitating and affect my ability to be present.

I also partake in behaviors such as obsessive body picking...picking at my skin or hair for example. Sometimes I don't even realize I'm doing it for a while but it gives me a feeling of momentary release or calm. 

Anyways, I'm wondering if anyone else suffers from similar symptoms and have you tried medicating? If so, how have your symptoms changed by taking meds?

OCD,"Hello everyone, this is one of many posts that I've been writing lately here on reddit, the main reason is that I feel that I can't believe myself and rely only on other people to tell me who I am supposed to be. You see I've been trans for almost 7 months now but for about a month I am struggling with crippling self-doubt to the point where I can't function properly. I remember when I started being trans it felt right, sure the dysphoria was really strong and all but at least I had hope for a better future, that all ended when the doubt came. I feel dysphoria - ""it's all fake""/""you are simply confused""/""you're making this up"", I don't feel dysphoria - ""It was all fake""/""See? You're fine"" and so on. I've explored every possible explanation, everything but I can't stop going in circles thinking about the same sign again and again and again. Sometimes it seems to stop for a second, give me some space, let me breathe and then it just starts again with the same force. At first I was scared at that though, that I would have to detransition, that I would have to go back to being a guy, then something convinced me that I was scared just so I could lie to myself again and keep myself from detransitioning by faking cis OCD and in truth I have trans OCD and that is what is lying to me. Like it doesn't matter what I wanted because I'm so lost that everything lost it's meaning, my emotions seem all faked by something inside of my brain. Sometimes I feel like I have some kind of OCD, other times I think that I can't have OCD and I'm using that to have some sort of excuse and then I think that is also an excuse and I just don't know anymore. My therapist said that it might be OCD and reffered me to a psychologist but it will take some time to get to one and I honestly just need some temporary reassurance because this is literal hell.

OCD,"Before I say this I wanna say I’m not in school lol

So this is a thought I had, I feel like a psycho but it makes sense to me. So people carry knifes and guns for self protection correct? So is it wrong for a kid to have a knife or gun for protection? Weapons should never be in school at all but I’m saying if they were it shows people who pick on younger kids that they have a way to fight back IF needed. Obviously killing is NEVER justifiable in that sense only if someone else is trying to kill you. But if a kid carried that just tells the kids who pick on others to mind their business. And if they WERE threatened they have a way to fight (as in shoot or stab them in the leg). Like I said killing is never justified in that area and weapons shouldn’t be in school. But if it was does that make me a bad lesson to think it’s justifiable to have kids carry something for self control? And if people end up harming them they can use it by stabbing or shooting in the leg? I feel like an evil person but in all reality it’s no different then women carrying guns. Men can easily do something and if they have that the men know they have a way to defend

I’m really afraid I’m psycho because of this. Like I said. I never justify school shootings. But if the kids being harmed they have a way to shoot or stab in the leg just to protect themself

So all and all what I’m saying is I don’t think it’s really bad for kids to have a form of self protection IF they only use it for self protection and NEVER use it to kill (also preferably not a gun because that can get out of hand really fast. Preferably a knife because that’s less harmful)",Am I a bar person for thinking this way?
OCD,"So apparently I have this really weird case of OCD, where I basically have a blaming obsession that blames always one particular person for everything (and now it shifted to the loved one of that person once I started doing self-therapy for my OCD).

OCD,"For years, from when I was 11 or so up until I was 16, I jacked off to videos of animals mating and, once or twice, videos of animals fucking people. 
I’m pretty sure it was just because I was a horny teen and anything sexual was good enough to jack off to, in my eyes. I don’t think I was actually attracted to the animals.

I stopped, and haven’t done anything of the sort since (I’m 19 now).

In the last few months, I’ve been unable to stop thinking about bad things I’ve done in the past. And the other day, I read about paraphilias, and now I’m fucking terrified that me jacking off to that wasn’t just horny teen activity, but was instead because I’m doomed to be attracted to that forever.

The other day, I decided to watch a funny video compilation of dogs humping stuff to see if I felt anything. I figured that was a good way to test, you know? And I didn’t feel anything, aside from perhaps a mild twinge out of nervousness.

But then... I don’t feel proper arousal thanks to anything these days, really. I can jack off, but I never really feel that proper thrum of genuine arousal. I’ve not felt it properly for probably around two years now.

So I don’t know!! Do I have OCD??? Is that why I’m unable to get these constant thoughts out of my head?

I also feel like a twinge down below when kids or animals or like gore or whatever come up on a tv show, which for a long time I was so fucking afraid about, but I’ve recently learned about groinal response, which makes me feel slightly less like a horrible person.

OCD,"I’m done messing around with this now. I don’t want my OCD to try and dictate my life by telling me doing things as stupid as turning a tap again or flicking an app to the side on my phone otherwise my girlfriend might leave me eventhough she’s told me no matter what happens she’s not going anywhere. I’m sick and tired of believing thoughts over actual evidence. I’m sat here trying to stop myself from turning a tap because according to mr OCD over here if I don’t my girlfriend might leave me or wanna go on a break as if it’s gonna cause some butterfly effect stuff. It’s not going to happen and I know it deep down. I hate how convincing the thoughts feel. I’m going straight to the doctor tomorrow to ask about going back to therapy and if I can organise some medication or something cause the thoughts are coming at full force at the moment. It’s also telling me that because it’s worse this year than it was last year that it somehow increases the likeliness of what I’m scared of happening happening? It makes no sense logically and yet I’m still scared. OCD, you’re an asshole.Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.","The thoughts make no sense, yet I am still so scared"
OCD,"So I'm sure we all stress and obsess over morbid gross thoughts of us doing terrible things but am I the only who also has thoughts of my loved ones doing bad things? Or I even obsess over their thought like what if they have these bad thoughts? So not only do I perform mental compulsions to save myself and reassure I'm not a bad person but I also  do it to save my loved ones and reassure that they aren't bad either.  Like I have an obsession with praying and apologizing to God. So I'll be like God I promise me or my loved ones would never do these bad things and or I'll say God I promise me and or my loved don't enjoy our bad thoughts. Ect ect . It's stressful too because I  feel like I need to say things in a certain order and be super literal and in detail and I even feel like I have to use multiple synonyms for a word.  Like using just one word isn't enough I have to use multiple words with the same meaning. It sucks and I hate it, makes me feel like I being weird towards myself, my loved ones and God. I believe in a higher power but like I'm not even super religious but I just have these thoughts since like I was in elementary school.  I'm 24 now and I've been suffering with OCD since then. Pure O too, my compulsive behaviors or mostly mental.",Does anyone ever have intrusive thoughts of even other people doing bad things?
OCD,"For example, Did I feel my body for growths and find nothing, or do I want to be healthy so badly that I convinced myself that I felt nothing, and like inserted a false memory or something -

OCD,"So, I have previously dealt with intrusive thoughts about having an STD, but alas I do not (thankfully) but with the guy I had been worried I was pregnant and I turned out not to be but now the thought is always there. I have since got a new boyfriend and it has been over a year and we haven’t had sex. I am scared that like even if i’m on birth control and he wears a condom there is a way that i’ll get pregnant and maybe not even know it. I do not want to strain the relationship but the thoughts are very intense and scary, I feel like when I have sex with him the thoughts are going to hit so much harder and I am going to constantly worry that i’m pregnant (and this is really stressful to type because i also feel like by typing it out I am in some way jynxing myself and in turn it will happen.)",OCD &amp; Intercourse
OCD,"I'm trying really hard to observe my thoughts but I realized my doubts keep messing with me. If i think of seeking improvement, my brain goes ""why are you trying to heal from a mental illness you don't actually have?"" Even when I already had my diagnosis, I would question every intrusive thoughts, my reactions to them and compare it with other OCD sufferers' responses. If it was different, then it would mean that the intrusive thought is not a result of OCD.

Recently, I'm obsessing over why human lives are significant. Used logic to counter the thought, however, I started accepting the intrusive thoughts and even found them logical. Really tired from thinking this way.. it affected the way I view everyone. It even ties in with my previous theme, Harm OCD. It goes ""if no one is significant, then it should be fine to do smth harmful to them."" Idk what this is, can it also be classified under OCD? If not, then does anyone have a clue of what it might be? I just started a new job several days ago and I honestly don't need OCD to ruin anything. If anyone has a similar experience / tips, please share it here or consider dm-ing me. Thanks in advance!",How do I heal from this?
OCD,"I’ve been diagnosed with OCD for quite some time, I’ve got it mainly under control however recently after a knock to my ego and been self doubting whether or not I am a intelligent person. 

The thoughts are always “you’re not as intelligent as you thought”, “what if you’re actually dumb” etc and it’s been a rough few weeks. 

Anyone shared this or is it just me?",Intelligence OCD
OCD,"For the last week or two, especially when I’m working, I have intrusive/unwanted recollections of dreams I’ve had over the years. The dreams weren’t significant, and not all of them make sense. It doesn’t really stop me from what I’m doing or cause any thing else to happen and it’s only for a second or few seconds. I’m not seeing anything I’m just thinking of the dream or remembering it. I have this sensation like 10+ times a day it seems. It’s not really deja vu because it’s not like I look at something and am reminded of it. And there is not really any trigger to it. And I’m not thinking about dreams when it happens. 

I did have deja vu once recently where I was sending a person a picture of something they asked to see and I wasn’t sure if it felt familiar cause I did it before or I dreamed about it. 

But when I do try to think of dreams, I do have recollections no matter what. And when I am texting someone about dreams like I am now. I also get it. I’ve had it twice while texting this.

My sleep schedule is all over the place cause of work. But I usually sleep a full 10-12 hours. I don’t really have trouble falling asleep either but I’ll occasionally twitch when falling asleep. Like a jolt. 

I don’t take melatonin and haven’t anytime recently. But I do dream frequently and always have cause I have an overactive mind (ADHD/OCD) 

I believe the flashbacks started around the time I started taking a single pill (100mg) but could have happened before. I don’t think this is the cause because I used to take 2x 50mg daily which equals 100mg. 

If I ignore it I don’t really get anxiety but if I think about it, it may happen again or I’ll get nervous.",Intrusive memories of old dream
OCD,"I have a lot of fear over losing my friendships. My best friend is graduating college soon. I’m afraid I’m always the first one to text or that I say too much. Doing this also springs up fears of pushing them away.

The problem is, I don’t want to come across as a dick and actually harm the friendship. I have been shorter than usual in my texts (but the friend sends short texts more often than I do) and I don’t text nearly as often anymore.

If this is reassurance seeking, then send me on my way. I just don’t want this practice to actually end up destroying our friendship, lol.",Is not texting my friend first a bad ERP?
OCD,"I can't work because I am so obsessed with Googling things. If there is a question in my mind I google it and I can't f\*\*\*\*\*g stop it it is effecting my work life and really getting to me, as you can see below it is not medical or about one topic.

OCD,"Aren't we lucky it's just OCD, that it is just a false alarm and none of your thoughts are real and will become real. We are always 100% safe. Lucky us. 

If you believe or know this, and I think most of us do (deep down we know). Just like people who are scared of spiders that know a spider is actually not harmful. 

Then it's time to let this know to your feeling system. But we can't communicate with the feeling system. So the feeling system will need to see for itself.   


It doesn't matter where or when you start or restart, how you start, how high the anxiety is, even if you start with the most difficult thing to resist. Even if the false alarm rings so loud it will always be false. The building will never burn down, no matter what. You know this, so why would you run outside? Enjoy the sound of the false alarm and witness the building not burning down, cause you already know.

Want to use OCD in a positive way? It's positive we can say it is atleast OCD and the building will never burn down.

OCD,I'm really worried that I could be a narcissist and not know it because someone said that if you were raised by a narcissist you will probably have narcissistic tendencies and I had a stepdad for 8 years who was a narcissist. Is that the same as being raised by narcissistic parents? How do I know if I'm a narcissist?,How would I know if I were a narcissist?
OCD,"I don’t know if that’s the best way to describe it. Say you feel like you’re a horrible person, usually people would ask around and ask people they know have a positive opinion of them whether they think they’re a horrible person or not. Does anyone ever ask people who don’t like you, to satisfy your obsessions rather than counter them, as a sort of self-sabotage?",DAE do the opposite of reassurance?
OCD,"I’ve known for a really long time that something is wrong with my head. I will fixate on things to the point of exhaustion. Like I have spent full days sleeping because I couldn’t handle my thoughts... I get extreme guilt over things other people tell me are nothing, but I still feel like I’m a criminal or that I HAVE done something that has made me a bad person. And I’ve obsessed with lots of interactions I’ve had with kids and feel like it somehow makes me a p******** even though I work around kids a lot and know I’m not attracted to them. Now, looking around here, I’m a little relieved to know other people have experienced that too? 

I also maladaptive daydream really badly and it’s taking over my life. I’m also terrible at time management because it takes me so long to confirm something is done before I can move on. I don’t trust my own memory at all. I also experience this while driving. I didn’t start driving regularly into age 22 because I was too panicked by the idea. Even now, I have things I do out of fear. I’ve driven back to work before to make sure I didn’t hit anyone in the parking lot because my brain suddenly convinced me I did. And I’m extremely anxious about people looking at me as I drive because I don’t feel like I’m doing it right. 

I never knew why I was like this but it was hurting me inside. I feel really broken. I feel like trash all the time and I and never accomplish anything. Is it worth it to get a formal diagnosis, therapy, and maybe medication? I feel like my issues are too ingrained into me and that I’d be just spewing embarrassing stuff to a therapist and ultimately feel the same except now they know what a train wreck I am.

OCD,"My list:

* Corrective inner speech can be essential. It's about recognizing and ""disassuring"" that the thoughts you obsess now are unnecessary, unreasonable so on. It doesn't mean that they cannot be accurate or meaningful, just that you want to let go of them at the moment. And you do the correction right when obsessioning starts. Correction is therefore not ""cheating"", it's about efficiency. It may feel like cheating, if you're fixated to ""just right"" OCD / similar. But it's not, it's about learning to effectively process negative thoughts.
* Obsessioning does not necessarily add to quality of observation, try whether you can produce same outcomes without obsessing. You may be surprised to discover that obsessioning just makes it more difficult.
* Obsessioning may make things much harder.
* Obsessioning may not be helpful.
* Obsessioning that's unreasonable is unrealistic, unnecessary, ...
* Obsessioning may take time from other activities.
* Everytime you start to obsess, why not rather replace it with some other way of managing stress? Such as, taking a walk, doing some yoga or something. Note: based on my experience, doing this actually may seem like hassle, since you may be very fixated to OCDing for anxiety relief. But it's objectively better and **more normal** than doing OCD. And doing it instead of OCD should become easier over time.
* The idea of ""controlling"" or ""pure"" thoughts is mostly delusional. Normal reasoning does not require the kind of control or ""purity"" that OCD gives you. The very habit of requiring purity or control or certainty or ... is an OCD symptom.",Most crucial anti-obsessional techniques you know?
OCD,"Hi I'm here again because I've re-awakened another kind of instrussive thoughts, this time about being gay. I was masturbating and a dick AD pop up during what I was watching and this normally wouldn't bother me at all but I've been struggling a LOT with instrussive thoughts, it's Ben absolutely awful, and I told myself ""wouldn't it be funny if i made that a big deal and question my sexuality"" and no it isn't funny and sadly that thought grew more and now I'm hurting myself with that. I identify as straight and feel attracted to woman, like even now with these thoughts I still feel just as attracted to women as I did before the thoughts so I know for sure that I'm not gay but it's like ""But what if you're secretly gay"" or ""what if your supressing it like those cases of men who turn out gay"" I don't have anything against gay people nor it makes me feel anything bad I respect them a lot, but I think this fucks with me because it fucks with my identity and how I see myself. I say re awakened because I remember being afraid of being actually gay as a teen, because as a teen it's actually a scary thing and I remember having intrusive thoughts during masturbation or about being attracted to men, but I've really never feel attracted like if I focus on those thoughts they don't arouse me or I've never had a boner thinking about men.

OCD,"Excerpt: 

Let me give you an example of how you can apply The DARE Response to these intrusive thoughts. Remember, you can’t control intrusive thoughts or worries; you can control only your response to them. Let’s say for example that you’re cutting the vegetables for dinner, and your partner walks into the kitchen and gets something out of the fridge. As they have their back to you, an intrusive thought crosses your mind: “What if I lost control and stabbed him/her in the back with this knife?” 

The old you would have felt a jolt of terror punch you in the stomach and maybe even scare you enough to have to put the knife back in the drawer. The new you, using the philosophy of The DARE Response, doesn’t put the knife down but keeps chopping and begins by defusing the anxious “what if.” “What if I just randomly stabbed him/her with this knife?” “Oh well, then I’d get locked up. At least I wouldn’t have to make dinner anymore!” 

You defuse the anxious thought by being flippant or humorous toward it, instead of being scared by it. Use whatever response you feel achieves that goal. It’s a bit like the way you might respond to a small child who comes into the room dressed as a monster trying to scare you. “Oh, you’re so big and scary!” you say with wry smile. Then allow the intrusive thought to be present without any resistance. Let it stay for as long as it likes. 

Remember the beach ball example. If you try to push it down, it will bounce back, so let it be present and then gently move your attention back to what you were doing. 

On occasion, when you’re feeling quite anxious, some thoughts can have a highly persistent nature. I call it a “high glue factor” as they really stick to you! This is where you can implement the “run toward” step of The DARE Response. Instead of just acknowledging and accepting the thought, you can get excited and demand more of it to really shake yourself loose of its grip. “Oh that’s a weird idea again of doing something totally inappropriate. It seems very strong today. Okay—so let’s have it! I’m going to think about this all day. Come on, let’s see if I can think of even stranger things than that.” 

Lastly, engage with whatever is at hand. In this case, you move your attention back to making the dinner all the while not pushing the thought away. With very intrusive thoughts you may have to do the above steps several times in a row each time the intrusive thoughts grab a hold of you. Once you remove the emotional response to intrusive thoughts, you normalize them and they no longer have an emotional pull. When they no longer have a pull, they fall away by themselves naturally as they have nothing to cling onto.",Has anyone read the DARE book? Is this a healthy way to deal with OCD? The author takes great pains to say he doesn't agree that anxiety needs to be broke down into separate diagnoses (like OCD)
OCD,"I have been stuck in a really thought loop for days about my own death. I force myself to try and comprehend non-existence until I feel fake. I repeatedly think about how I’m going to die and how my eventual non existence makes erases everything in my life. I feel like I NEED to think about it now, because it feels like death is imminent even though I’m young. My line of reasoning is that there’s no objective difference between dying tomorrow and dying years from now. It gives me severe tunnel vision and I feel like I need to detach myself completely so I don’t have anything I care about to before I die.

Am I a pedophile or is my brain fucking with me

Ok the title sounds like some pedophile type shit
Ill explain
Ok first the cousin part I was 12 and a year before my mother told me that a girl was my cousin and when I turned 12 a few months later I was in class and I thought she was hot and I jacked off in class well not jack off i was just rubbing my penis and moving it and I put stuff around me that hides me doing it and i checked if someone was looking and I didnt make myself seem suspicous and I didnt jack off infront of her, nobody noticed beacuse i literally made sure they didnt and when I got home i jacked off to a picture of her and I felt really bad and then a few weeks later when class finished I jacked off when nobody was in the classroom when school ended and we dont have cameras i dont know what i jacked off exactly to but i jacked off and i did it again a few weeks later

Ok the 9/10 year old part
I went to a training thing and my 13 year old brain thought this girl had a nice back and I knew she was in like 4th grade or smth but I still fucking jacked off (I jacked off to a picture when she was 9 i think FUCK ME MAN) (I just turned 13 a few days ago before this happend)
And my dumbass brain then when i finished and went out started calling me a pedophile and then my brain has been calling me a pedophile ever since
And I jacked off to a 10 or 11 year old think she was 10 and I fucking did it 3 times to the to 10 or 11 year old beacuse my brain said ok do it again ok do it again
Also a few months before my brain started telling me look at the back of that girl 9 times and they were all so young like 4th grade or lower and I didnt jack off to them but my brain did that and later it tried to convince me i was a pedophile and shit and i did tests to see if i was a pedophile and i didnt get any treatment i was too scared to tell anyone and i had a lack of treatment in my area and whenever I mentioned pedophiles or made fun of them i told myself 3 times you are not a pedophile

Oh yeah also i fucking got horny or smth and I was behind a pillar thing and I jacked off and then someone like 3-5 meters away passed by with their kids and I felt like a monster i dont know what i jacked off to but it might of been the 10/11 year old but i think i was 12 at this time

From those days I felt like I was going to hell and that im a monster
You can say whatever you want fucking murder me

Alright when I was 12 and im 13 now

Ok I jacked off to a 9-10-11 year old and fell like a pedophile

I jacked off to my cousin dont know what cousin she is idk if shes 2nd 3rd 4th or what defo not first or 2nd i think

I jacked off to that same girl in class well not really jack off i more or less moved my dong around not like go up down just moved it around so it rubbed and i didnt cum in class i tried to hide and made sure nobody noticed

I jacked off after class 2 times (nobody was in the classroom)

I jacked off behind a pillar thing outside and people on the road walked by it was night they didnt see me im pretty sure we were like 5meters away around that

OCD,"I am at a point with my ocd where it's the worst it's ever been and that keeps being said every year even though i have become more aware of my ocd in the past 4 month due to speaking with  councilor it has not improved infact now i am aware of the difference between thoughts and facts i'm bullying myself because even though i am aware of this i am not able to stop the rituals because when i do or have done i feel so out of control and empty and everything bad iv'e ever done comes rushing in and i feel like such a terrible terrible person.

I moved into my own place only because i can get benifit money which i am so fortunate for because i was living with my dad my parents seperated when i was young my mother died when i was 18 im now 24 they hated eachother and would say things to me about eachother i was always stucks on who is lying since i was a child. Anyway my dad does not understand mental health at all he didn't care to research by ocd he forced me into therapy or would kick me out at 17 even though i never got therapy just 5 years of tests to be told i'm to complex for the therapy they provide... If i stayed at my dads i belive i would have killed myself. He would laugh at me when i cried and ignored me when i cried for him to care he would point at me ridicule me as if he was playing god no body on my dads side understood no matter how much i'd explain i felt exposed and trapped inside a sound proof box like they had no ears. 

Since iv'e moved iv'e realised a lot of my ocd rituals and noticed more i wasnt even aware of and now ive come to it everything i seem to do fits into the box of ocd i lost my friend because i spoke to her about it she said i was so negative she said all these horrible things that im manipulative to get sympathy and i cant stop repeating it around in my head and every other person who misunderstands this disorder i wasn't aware that even sharing things of my ocd was to get reasurence that other people think this way now i realise subcouncously i must have anyway the friend didn't belive anything i said she also did all this on my mother death aniversary and knew it was a hard date this was 2 weeks ago. 

I have nobody to talk to and im alone in my flat im so appreciative i have my flat to learn about my ocd because im not sure i could when i was forced into therapy when i was a teen because i was constantley in flight or fight mode due to my dad being neglectful and my mother dying i was also sexually asulted through my teens and wasnt even aware that it was sexual asult till i was 21 then i got rapped by someone id met online a few times and i cant stop picturing his facial tick gesture and now i realise what the gesture was it was disgust because i pull the same face at my ocd rituals and its like i become him i see his face right infront of me.

My ex friend i mentioned she also said i play the victim when i really don't intend to at all i am just saying what i experienced and i dont mean to come of that way to reddit post either and sorry for all the english errors i'm exhuasted and if i change one thing i will spend hours making everything perfect

i also have ocd which i think is different where i worry something bad will happen if i dont lock my front door ontop of the above things to usually i dont know what im worried about when the intruisions come in but that one is clear if i where to guess about the others id probably say im worried that i become said person and pick up their traits and this aligns with pocd and all those other horrid intrusions i have when seeing certain kind of people or hearing sounds. 

I'm so confused and everything is all muddled in my head i would write it all down but that takes a hell of a lot of effort and my hands are bleeding and im exhausted",Exhausted please can you give suggestions if u have some
OCD,"This random thoughts are not letting me do anything, i have a very strange OCD in which every morning my mind says me that i have masturbated at night and i have lost my intelligency and power to study whole day for exams and it compels me to relapse and break my streak on no fap application for no reason and because of this thought i run towards bathroom i close the door and i try to check my inner garment whether i have ejaculate or not, but even if i have not. i try to doubt myself and check my garment number of times, if i find some colour difference in my garment then i think that i have ejaculate(i know this sounds meaningless) but i know i have not ejaculate, but those thoughts keeps bumping in my head and frustrate me to do nothing whole day but to think and investigate whole day whether i have ejaculate or not  !!

OCD,"A month ago I went on a vacation for my birthday and one day on the trip I got extremely drunk. We were talking to a group of men and women in the people and one guy and I were having a conversation and my boyfriend left me in the pool with him and we kept talking. From what I remember I was going on about stories of celebrities we met, stories about my modeling days and I remember him complimenting me as I was probably drunk, getting external validation and just chatting with a random stranger blacked out. For a while Ive dealt with cheating ROCD with my boyfriend and get intrusive thoughts about ""what if this happened..what if I cheated...what if this is cheating..."" and so on; leading to a terrible sense of guilt and unrest.

As you could imagine, this drunken encounter put me over the edge. I texted the man from the pool after the conversation to which he said don't worry he really liked me and it was a great talk and then next time we all coincide he hopes I have more fun stories and celebrity encounters. That should've been enough to put a normal person at ease. My first ocd thought was worried about ""emotionally cheating"" by talking about my modeling stories and vaguely remember showing my youth headshots on my phone (I kind of do to most people when I get drunk, don't ask aha). My boyfriend was like 20 feet away the whole time and let me go off drunk and talk since we both are pretty chill about things and clearly he didn't think this would ever trigger me. It was so inconsequential to every one else but me apparently...but my brain doesn't think that. Once I got the reassurance that nothing bad was said from the pool guy my brain jumped to ""you definitely kissed"". I keep decoding the texts from a month ago with the logic that ""if he said he really liked me and it was a really great talk that means I did something bad and he's just not telling me"", and the sad part is my brain makes that sound so logical. I can't get this thought out of my head and I know if that happened I would've remembered, but my brain is absolutely creating these false memories and mentally reviewing every part of the conversation I can vaguely remember, every hand placement and body movement I can remember from the situation in my head...its not normal. It is exhausting. I saw my erp therapist who told me to accept the thoughts, act like it happened and move on with my life. But this constant guilt feeds at me and I cannot tell if it is my ocd feeding this obsession or if its real guilt. What brought it back up is this guy and I exchanged instagrams apparently and I forget about it until he commented some fire emojis on my recent Instagram selfie which led to another downward spiral of doubting thoughts and guilt, when in reality he probably thinks he just made a drunk friend. I don't know. 

I stopped drinking for about a month now and I feel great. Getting too drunk seemed to be an issue with me but I never thought that one drunken conversation would escalate my ROCD this bad. I try not to bring it up with my boyfriend or ask reassuring questions but my ocd is making me feel like I'm living with some terrible secret and guilt.

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone related to this? Because Im really fucking sick of it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tldr: thinking a drunk conversation I had with a man on vacation is cheating on my boyfriend. It has been a month and the obsession still stands. I want to shoot my head sometimes.",Why the fuck has this obsession not gone away. It is ruining my relationship. Can someone relate to this or tell me Im not crazy or a bad person? Or message me?

OCD,"Some of you may have seen my last post here asking about medication. I didn’t reply on there I realise but if you read it or replied, thank you! 

Anyway, I recently finally started Sertraline at 50mg and have been taking it for 10 days. It’s taken me months to get to the point of asking for medication and I’m happy. 

My first week I had no real side effects. I had some jaw clenching and excessive yawning but that’s died down now. The past few days though, I’ve been getting sweats/hot flushes followed by the complete opposite in the middle of the night when Im asleep or trying to sleep. I’m justifying these worse than usual side effects as the sertraline ‘beginning to build to a beneficial level’ in my brain.

OCD,"I’ve had harm ocd since I was I think 12. I never told anyone but it’s like the typical thoughts about harming people or I’ll think, “what if I kill someone in my sleep?” I tried to convince myself I had antisocial personality disorder and was faking my feelings.  I’ve ruled that out, it does both me, but not as much as my health ocd. Keep in mind, I don’t convince myself I have any physical health issues like cancer or whatnot, it’s all metal problems. My ocd calmed down for about a year, a few intrusive thoughts here and there. However, I’ve recently been getting thoughts about having mental health issues. Last month, I thought I was autistic and was masking my whole personality. But then, it turned into schizophrenia, which scared me because my uncle had it before he past. My mother told me his schizophrenia was drug induced and that him and a friend he did drugs with both got it after long term drug usage. I’m 17 now, but ever since middle school, I would have thoughts here and there about having schizophrenia. They were never constant or as severe as they are now. I used to think hypnogogic hallucinations before bed that I get here and there were schizophrenia. I also remember being on vacation and I heard voices, so I started freaking out thinking I was developing on site schizophrenia, but when I woke up &amp; asked my mom about it, she said there was a party going on downstairs and she also heard it. Recently however, I’ve been worried about delusions because schizophrenia can cause delusion. I make up delusions in my head and question if they’re real or if I believe them. It started when I started randomly thinking I was schizophrenic, then in a college class, the thought passed my mind, “your thoughts aren’t yours.” At that moment, I could barely focus in class. I started freaking out and questioning why I thought that though. I questioned if I was delusional. After I got home, I told my mother and she assured me it was just my anxiety over having the disorder. So she told me how schizophrenic people think. She said, “ People with schizophrenia actually believe these things. They think aliens are out to get them’’ next thing you know, “mom is an alien, she controls everything.” And I started obsessing over that thought, I questioned if I believed it. Another example is, I started freaking out in the story last Friday over thinking mannequins were out to get me, and I kept thinking, “ I knew it, I’m having delusions. I knew I was schizophrenic” in order to calm myself, I thought in my head, “this is ridiculous, if I really thought they were out to get me, I might as well think all objects can move when people aren’t around and are out to get them.” Next thing you know, I’m thinking about objects being able to move and being out to get me... I know this is irrational, but I question if I believe it and if I’m delusional. Sometimes I’ll even look at an object and I’m about to think of a delusion &amp; stop myself. Also, sometimes I’ll think in my head, “you’re crazy, stop doing this.” And I’ll think “why am I referring to myself as “you”, is that a symptom of psychosis?” The other night, I had a hypnagogic hallucination before bed due to stress. It was right before dozing off to sleep, and I was playing over scenarios in my head of people that I don’t know, one was an old lady. And the thoughts were saying weird stuff, “you’re not crazy, it’s ocd.” And next thing you know, I get scared and get up. My first thought was, “Do I believe people are living in my brain? Why did that happen? Do I have DID?” Idk if that was hypnogogia or if I’m developing a disorder. I also have existential OCD that makes me thing, “Is this real” or “What if I’m dead?” or even “what if I wake up everyday as different person built with memories?” It weird. This is accompanied by DPDR. With all of this going on however, I do have insight &amp; I’m aware this isn’t normal. Sometimes I think I’m going psychotic and start hearing stuff. I read people with OCD more are likely to develop schizophrenia, which is my worst fear. I often question if I’m schizophrenic, but convincing myself I have ocd as a form of denial. What do you all think?",Could I be schizophrenic or just my ocd ?

OCD,"TW: POCD, mention of : HOCD, HARMOCD, ROCD, INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS 

I was formally diagnosed with OCD about a month ago but i’ve been dealing with it for eight years. when i first developed OCD my major presenting obsessions were POCD, Harm OCD and guilt/confession issues. for a long time i worried that like if i thought a child was cute in like a child way that meant i felt some sort of attraction to them (I don’t) and i’ve since sort of grown out of that thankfully. although now my issues are more associated with my relationships, and if i’m a morally good person and when i am not thinking or obsessing over something i worry that like i made the ocd up and that i’ve lied to everyone and been misdiagnosed and this is something i worry about a lot because my biggest fear is lying. i don’t want to inaccurately relay events to another person let alone lie about an identity (which i know is just another ocd issue but i still worry) and like when i’m not actively guilty about something i feel like i need to find something to feel guilty about. i’ve been trying to fight it off with physical and mental compulsions and rituals but i’m scared that when i am not doing anything and alone that i will remember something terrible i’ve done or a thought i have since proven to myself was untrue will come up again and i’ll feel the same guilt and confession issues (which are by far my worst issue. the guilt literally kills me. it’s constant.)

Or off meds that treated it 6 months ago 



Slowly the traces of it that remained seem to be getting worse ? 


For example here is my night routine 



1.	Check showers to make sure no ones there, make sure my eyes go to the middle tile where the light strikes a little. 
2.	Make sure I am on the right tiles for step number one while avoiding parts of the tile struck by light. 
3.	check area to the right of sink where shelves are, bottom right top left bottom middle and middle top. 
4.	walk back and fourth from sink tile area to shelves area to make it 3 times that I passed by the mirror 
5.	look in the mirror. This one is tricky. I have to make sure I don’t mind how I look because I think that if I look ugly in the mirror, It will make my ugly. This can lead to me rearranging my hair right before I sleep. 
5.	step on a particular tile in the bathroom, then on a particular tile to exit. Turn off light, make sure that I am showing on the right panel of the mirror, if for instance it’s folded in I go back in bathroom close it mostly and do step 4 2 more times to make it 3 
6.	close door while making sure i see myself on all 3 panels of the mirror but specifically the one all the way to the left 
7.	turn off light if didn’t do already before step 6 
8.	pull on door slightly to get it as ajar as possible before closing it 
9.	close SLOWLY while making eye contact with the area above the toilet without blinking to make sure no one / nothing is there. I can’t look at the toilet out of fear it’ll make me ugly/ something bad will happen. 
10. Once closed I move on to kitchen and living room where I have other routines tho not as complex

So I’ve been having issues with harm OCD. I’m afraid I’ll harm myself, babies, and people who have wronged me. Naturally I would never kill anything. I couldn’t even kill an animal. But I’m worried and here’s why

When I was a kid I remember taking little big catchers and catching Crain flies and shaking them until they died. That makes me cringe even saying that. And when my dad saw I told him “well there’s more out there anyway” like it didn’t matter I killed it. I also would step on a ton of ants. I would never even do this now but even like last year when flies get into the house i kind of enjoy trying to swat them with a towel and trying to hit them. I heard psychopaths start on small animals. Does this count?!?!? I would never ever even harm a Crain fly for no reason now, let alone something like a rat or dog

Now here’s why I think it’s just OCD. My dad always says I have a huge heart. If I was a psychopath would my parents be able to tell since an early age i didn’t have a huge heart? And like 2 weeks ago I almost cried arguing with my mom lol. And I also woke up in panic after dozing off a lot of times because I remember one day my old dog is going to die.

My reasoning is that they would know I own the computer, so even if I move into my own apartment, them merely knowing about the computer and it being on their minds would feel kind of intrusive, it's as if they would be in my new apartment with me which leaves me feeling like I have no privacy at all.

OCD,"Ever since my OCD came into full effect, I have a hard time completing simple, everyday tasks.

For instance, something as simple as putting an object back in it's place in my room...I will place the object in it's correct spot, but then I will become fixated on it, straightening it out, making sure it is ""just right"", but even after I straighten it out, I will continue to feel ""stuck"", staring at the object to make sure it is straight, and it just feels like the task is not complete.  I will then eventually let go, but it is hard.

This can really happen with anything...even if I feel like I didn't say something ""right"", I will feel compelled to say it again to correct myself, but even doing that does not make it right, and so I will feel stuck.

OCD,"I've been getting better about managing my obsessive thoughts, but one issue I have is that my OCD doesn't like it when I'm not obsessing over something. I sometimes get breaks from my obsessions, and it feels almost as if my OCD is just looking for something to obsess over when it isn't fixated on something. When this happens, I feel a general sense of anxiety, almost as if my OCD is saying ""Wait, this isn't right. Shouldn't you be obsessing over something?"" It'll even bring up things that I haven't obsessed over in a while and make me start doubting those things again even thought I had previously proven to myself that I didn't need to worry about those obsessions. Is this a sign that I'm ""starving"" my OCD and it'll get weaker if it can't obsess over something?

OCD,"Hello,

I have magical thinking and harm OCD and I recently started to feel guilty because I didn't see a therapist until I became very sick. During 10 years, I had OCD thoughts, some involving harming people around me. I feel so bad that I stayed in the OCD cycle even if I knew something was wrong with me. It's like I didn't care about the people around me that were part of my thoughts. I feared I could be dangerous and knew my thoughts were bad, but I didn't do nothing about it until it became too hard to live with this. When taking important decisions, I often had to chose between two ""consequences""; for exemple, if I chose the option A, I had to harm a family member and if I chose the option B, had to harm a friend. I never listened to these consequences, but they created a lot of distress, guilt and anxiety. Now,  I can't believe it took so much time for me to seek help. I know that, younger, I didn't know what I had, but when I started to realize it was OCD, why didn't I consult right away? It makes me feel guilty.

Hope someone can help me clarify this :(",OCD guilt about not seing a therapist earlier

OCD,"Hi, I'm 19 years old, and I can't live with myself anymore. I am so scared and I just want somebody to listen to my story. 

This all started for me around last october, when I watched a video on somebody trying to catch pedophiles. I was disgusted by what they did, but after that I started getting scared about maybe being a pedophile. I got over those thoughts relatively quickly, and I was fine for a month or two, but then it came back in january, when I saw a picture of a 13 year old girl, and I was worried about if I thought she was cute in a regular way, or if I was actually repressing attraction to it. This time, it hit me way harder, but eventually I sort of started to get better, until around a few weeks ago, when a memory resurfaced. I had rembered it before, but had always just put it off to being a kid. I grew up very sheltered, and I don't know how much I knew about how much it was wrong, but when I was little, I was in the kids class at church, and I had a little girl on my lap. I got a spontaneous erection, and I started bouncing my knee up and down and started feeling sensations, and I kept bouncing my knee because of that. The memory is sort of vague, but I know it's real. I think I was probably somwehere in middle school, because we started going to that church when I was in 5th grade. Now I'm terrified about it and the implications of what it means. I'm terrified im a bad person, and I'm worried I'm misremembering it, and I did even worse things, which dossnt even make sense bc there were adults in the room. My pocd focuses more on being afraid of being attracted to young teens, but ever since I remembered that, i also started being scared of being attracted to little kids, and I just don't know what to do anymore.

The issue is,  I constantly ruminate on my actions. Silly things. I’ve managed to keep my confession compulsion at bay which is a victory for me, but it’s like I always have this feeling of being guilty?

Examples of things I’ve ruminated over are:

-I found nudes of my ex on my phone, I felt aroused by them but deleted them permanently.

-a girl I used to chat with sent me a dm last month and I didn’t reply at all, but didn’t tell my gf because I just forgot about it until the other day and now think it’s silly to bring up

-I’ve looked at porn a few times since being together. 

These sorts of things that my rational brain KNOWS are not cheating or infidelity, but things that my OCD brain latches onto and says “see dude, this is why you don’t deserve her.” 

Can anyone else relate to this? If so, things you do to help yourself? My compulsion is definitely confession, which my therapist says I just need to “not do”, especially if the confession involves something that’ll make my girl feel insecure.

OCD,"For the last week or two, especially when I’m working, I have intrusive/unwanted recollections of dreams I’ve had over the years. The dreams were significant, and not all of them make sense. It doesn’t really stop me from what I’m doing or cause any thing else to happen and it’s only for a second or few seconds. I’m not seeing anything I’m just thinking of the dream or remembering it. I have this sensation like 10+ times a day it seems. It’s not really deja vu because it’s not like I look at something and am reminded of it. And there is not really any trigger to it. And I’m not thinking about dreams when it happens. 

I did have deja vu once recently where I was sending a person a picture of something they asked to see and I wasn’t sure if it felt familiar cause I did it before or I dreamed about a full 10-12 hours. I don’t really have trouble falling asleep either but I’ll occasionally twitch when falling asleep. Like a jolt. 

I don’t take melatonin and haven’t anytime recently. But I do dream frequently and always have cause I have an overactive mind (ADHD/OCD) 

I believe the flashbacks started around the time I started taking a single pill (100mg) but could have happened before. I don’t think this is the cause because I used to take 2x 50mg daily which equals 100mg.

It's always food that I make at home, never when I eat out. I'm scared to even look at the back of a box because once I see a calorie count that is what I deem high I immediately have to change my whole entire meal plan, and if I do actually finish making it I can only eat a few bites before my mind starts to overthink it.

OCD,"Trigger warning, sexual abuse, no details though.

I do not have a diagnosis. But, I don't think it matters that much because of my history with mental health and getting diagnoses. I've had anxiety my whole life, and depression starting at 11, but I just didn't have the resources/ability to get a depression diagnosis until I was 19. It took another year (and being a patient in a mental health PHP) to realize that my baseline thought process was very skewed, and that anxiety is pretty much built into my personality.

I had a really difficult time coming to terms with even asking if I had these diseases because I was scared that I actually didn't, and it would come across as if I had so little mental fortitude that I believed my superficial sadness or worries were actually mental illness. I kind of feel the same way now because, at this point in my life, I don't know if my intrusive thoughts cause as much distress and avoidance as they would need to to be considered symptoms of a diagnosable disorder.

I know that I should speak to a psychiatrist about this, but I'm thinking about telling her the fucked up thoughts I have verbally, and I just think it would be easier to air them out here, anonymously and through writing, first. I'm kind of just going to monologue here, and I'd appreciate any comments this community has to say.

From the ages of 8-11, every time I would be on an unprotected subway platform, I would be overwhelmed by both an urge to jump and by an extreme fear of doing so. I would turn my back to the platform and grip something so that there was an extra step between me jumping (letting go of whatever I was holding on to). This urge/fear was completely alleviated by protected platforms (some stations had these automated 6 ft tall fences between you and the tracks). This feeling also happened whenever I was around something high I could jump off of.

I think things get a little muddied when my depression came into because I feel like my suicidal thoughts were ""real"". They weren't distressing, it was actually very comforting that I had an option for a way out. Years go by, and just because my brain is fucked up, I had such a disconnect that I 100% felt like my suicidal thoughts were just thoughts and that I wasn't suicidal at all.

So, freshman year of college comes around (last year), and I have this realization/mental breakdown, where I realize I actually do not plan to live out the rest of my life, my thoughts are real and that will my future if I do not intervene. That's when I started treatment for depression. I stopped smoking weed, and whenever I'd try again, I would just be plagued by thoughts of suicide. I don't even know if they were real now. They felt real. It also felt intrusive.  I don't know.

Last summer, I started smoking again. Things went well for a few months, and then I had another breakdown, and the thoughts I had keep coming back to haunt me. I am very afraid of them. I am afraid of having those thoughts enter my mind, the imagined feelings, and imagery. I feel the need to introduce some context before I say these thoughts.

For a while before that breakdown (like 2 years of time), I was somewhat suspicious that I had been sexually abused as a child. And, that's just not something you're allowed to be wrong about if you verbalize it. At this point now, I have worked out that that most likely did not happen, but there was a good amount of evidence suggesting that it was true (although none of those points would definitively say it happened). I don't think getting into the details is important, but my long-term boyfriend told me he also suspected that was true based on some things I've said and some behavior I've shown in the past. My point is, I didn't just make something up out of the blue.

In those two years' time, I would go through phases of tirelessly searching the internet, trying to science my way into figuring out if that happened to be or not. I never really found anything one way or another.

So, that second mental breakdown had to do with me ""realizing"" I had probably been sexually abused as a child. The thought process isn't important, but is is that immediately after, I was terrified that I would remember something, that I just would have this thing in my head that I, unwillingly, could be forced to relive over and over because I know my own mind would do something like that to me.

Even after I worked out that it most likely is not, I still am so scared of being in a mental space where I end up imagining it happen. So, I had to stop smoking of course. But, also, over the past 6 months or so, I have been struggling with panic attacks, primarily the dissociation aspect (which happened during both of my breakdowns), and each time I am terrified that my mind will produce something unspeakable for me to experience while I'm in that state.

I've written a lot here, thank you for listening. Do you guys think I have pure O? I feel like I could have had other obsessions but just not know it because of all the other things I just didn't know were mental illness thoughts. I really miss smoking, but I am so scared of the power my thoughts could have over me. In my pretty limited research into this subject, I've read that an effective treatment is to confront your thoughts instead of do things to avoid them, which makes them stronger. Do you think I should just smoke and actively try to think about these things to show it won't actually hurt me? I know this sounds absolutely ridiculous, but I just enjoyed smoking so much, I have great memories smoking with my friends, and it makes me unhappy to think it will never be in my cards again. I've done acid a couple of times, and I really enjoyed it too. I felt like it was something I'd like to do again (like 1 or 2 times a year), but it seems like that option is closed off too.

Edit: I just started college again this semester after literally putting everything on pause to treat my depression and anxiety. I just want to live normally. I want to have fun like people my age do, because I haven't been able to that much. I feel like my life has just been a series of disruptions to a person's normal development. ",I think I might have pure O. I don't know where i should go from here. Can someone help me.
OCD,"i wasn't specifically diagnosed with ocd along with the anxiety and depression, but recently i've been feeling increasingly perfectionist about the way my handwriting looks and i'm suspecting it could be related. my handwriting has always been good and i received compliments on it all the time, but each letter needs to look absolutely **perfect** or i have to erase the whole word and rewrite it. luckily i take most of my notes on my ipad so i don't have to physically erase and rewrite, but every time i mess up the tiniest bit i feel this irrepressible frustration at it, but i always have to wait until i've finished writing out the whole word or sentence before erasing the whole thing, otherwise the frustration grows. i can't seem to accept the mess up no matter how small it is, nor can i erase it right away instead of wasting so much time writing out the whole word and rewriting it. this has significantly prolonged the time it takes for me to take notes for class and adds so much more frustration to my life. i'm not asking for a formal diagnosis or anything and i'll try to bring this up to my therapist the next time i speak with her, i was just wondering if anyone has had this experience since i haven't seen much info about it online. if you have any advice on how to overcome it, they will be greatly appreciated. thanks!",extreme perfectionism about my handwriting

OCD,"Hi all, I struggle with sexually-based intrusive thoughts and due to this struggle with groinal responses. When they first started it was very troubling and confusing, but I’ve more or less gotten used to them now. The thing is at a certain point liquid started coming out of my penis when the groinal responses would happen. I am unsure if this liquid is urine or pre-ejaculate, but I really need it to stop. 

I believe that I may be developing contamination OCD as well. This combined with the liquids from groinal responses is very troubling. Whenever I go to the bathroom I fear that I will have left some of these liquids behind and if I don’t try to clean them up with soap and water I feel as if I’m committing a sex crime. I wash my hands way too much as well, to the point where my knuckles have become dry, red, and raw. 

I don’t masturbate anymore really because I’m afraid about getting cum on things, so I only really do it in the shower now. Due to the infrequent masturbation I have been having frequent wet dreams, which of course I feel as if I have to clean everything after. 

I think I may have developed a physical condition because my testicles and taint feel tight and uncomfortable occasionally. There must be something physically wrong right? Otherwise these liquids wouldn’t come out of my penis. 

Anyways I know this was all a lot, but my two questions regarding all of this are: 

1) Does anyone know what may be physically wrong with me?

2) How do I stop contamination obsessions?

OCD,"Stay the fuck away from weed. That shit will utterly tear apart your psyche and you'll have to spend 2 hours in a mindfuck loop of hell.   


I'm very curious if anyone of you guys ever had a fucked up experience on Weed similar to mine. I'd love to know your stories. Apparently can come from Derealization/depersonalization, general anxiety, OCD and ADHD. Just know that you aren't alone and I understand how horrible it is.  


&amp;#x200B;

I felt trapped, and extremely panicked, I wanted to escape from reality. I was seeing demonic hexagonal shapes, my vision was divided in these fucked up diamond shaped patterns that all represented the shit I was fearing. It felt as if the real world was made out of this hellraiser metallic material. I'd see borders from my vision and out side the borders were purple and pink visual hazes and they would contain picture example of any metaphorical thoughts I'd have.  I'd get a barrage of these existential thoughts and would try to solve one of these horrible thoughts to get a grasp on my sanity only for the evil voice inside my head to completely disprove my solution and add an even harder obstacle for me to solve while millions of other horrible thoughts added up and multiplied into groups and then group from those groups. I remember seeing a visualization of the level of mental understanding my brain was on and the number honestly was something like ""Uzihexalterafaux"" and it represented a shit pantsingly high number. and I'd go into another cycle of whatever the hell I was going through much more intense than the last. My brain mapped out the type of hell I was in and it was Daemonic Black x8 out of x10. Crazy shit.  


I'd have these waves/pulses that would hit me like waves of sudden realization that would add more and more ""realizations"" in my brain. I was convinced that I was either in hell or that I was facing a punishment that no mortal could even experience but that of a god. And I was cursed with immortality to endure it.   


At times I'd start to lose consciousness and see this blue type of tunnel, it turns out I was on auto pilot, I'd be in the house during the auto pilot and regain awareness outside my home with my loved one freaking out telling me that ""I'm going crazy."" The my loved one said that to me honestly gave me an overwhelming since of tragedy. Everything felt like a movie, that all of life only existed from my perspective and that it all led up to my experience, like some fucked up final trial to discover the ultimate truth. Constant Deja Vu, everything had a very overwhelming sense of familiarity but at the same time perceived it all as alien and weird. A huge constant paradox that my brain had to balance otherwise I'd be consumed by it all.  


Near the end things got better and my constant thoughts that would just give me horrible conclusions finally turned I'd now be challenged with questions that I'd answer with bad solutions only for now a good voice inside my head to give me good solutions to the questions of reality that would make sooth my panic and it would keep repeating there, each with better answers of my constant questions of reality that would plague me. At this point my high was now telling me that my questions and worries I'd have out existence was being solved and that what I experienced was just a trial for me be cured and that the ultimate understanding was actually good and all my worries and anxiety was for nothing. Afterwards I felt confused and decided to sleep. Even though the high ended on a good note the prior experience was deeply traumatizing for me and I was afraid I'd never be normal. After a few weeks I felt empty and a bit depressed. But I noticed my existential OCD was nearly gone.   


So in the end I honestly believe what happened was some fucked up exposure therapy that resulted in my existential OCD anxiety to pretty much go away. But good god the shit I went through was honestly fucked up. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy and would honestly prefer a bullet to the leg then to experience that shit again.  


I'm glad that something good came out of this experience, it cured my existential OCD and it honestly made me much more stronger mentally. I wear it as a badge of honor, it serves as a huge learning lesson. Respect the substances that you do.

OCD,"Hi All! 

I'm a 28F with OCD that dates back as far as I can remember. My OCD mainly manifests itself into responsibility and moral perfection. It is, frankly and excuse my language, fucking exhausting. Before the pandemic, I felt like I had made so much progress and then being in endless lockdowns and away from the routines that brought some perspective and routine into my life, I feel like I am in the most vulnerable place I have been in a long time. I know I will be okay, but I am not okay right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Despite this struggle, something that has really helped recently is joining OCD support groups. I am doing this over zoom and it is essentially an open meeting where you can share (or just listen) to others people's experiences with OCD. This is the first time in my life I have talked with people who have OCD and it has made me feel so much less alone. OCD manifests in so many different ways and it's easy to feel like no one might understand or relate to your struggle but trust that there are other people out there who completely understand what you are going through from their own experience.

Have a look online for OCD charities in your local area as there are so many different options, and feel free to message me if you are looking for any recommendations in the UK!",OCD Support Groups- You are not alone
OCD,"During period of OCD peak .one day my friends was talking about the explanation of being gay. My intrusive thoughts pop up and i had a groinal response i checked my penis and they noticed that then they look at themselves. No one told me anything ,but they know i saw him do that. they tend to believe that i am gay. I took meds for OCD i almost recoverd but they become a  big trigger of my OCD. When i set alone i feel good. Sometimes they ask me why you don't you get there with us as before.",How can i deal with that?
OCD,"I'm not sure if I have OCD; I've never been diagnosed. 

However, I do have extremely obsessive thoughts. Here are some examples of what I struggle with:

•First off, I worry excessively about things that I can't control -- random things. 

•When I read a book about a certain genre like Sun Tzu's Art of War or whenever I watch any politics-related video(s), my mind involuntarily starts thinking about a place near the south side of my former high school. Even after I finish watching the videos, my mind stays dwelling on the thought of that specific place. 

•Whenever I think about learning a specific language, my mind begins thinking about my grandmother's home. 

•When I call someone or I hear someone having a phone call with someone I know-- a friend, a family member, or whoever -- I begin thinking about their house or wherever they are at at that specific moment. 

•A while back, my family and I traveled to my uncle's house. After we returned home, I went back to doing my homework and focusing on doing my daily chores. However, my mind was still thinking about my uncle's home as if his home was somehow the default mode of my mind for that while. 

Does anyone struggle with this?",Does anyone with OCD or any obsessive thoughts struggle with getting specific places out of their mind?
OCD,"So, when I get intrusive thoughts, they will be like, for example- If i had a gross thought about a family member. 1st will come the thought. I try to ignore it, sometimes I will feel a pang of guilt, sometimes I can brush it off and move on fast. But when I think to myself: asking, checking,  It isn’t really that I think I am GOING to hurt them, it’s me obsessing about if i WANT to hurt them, or if i HAVE hurt them... does anyone get this? Like i know In my heart, mind, and soul that i will never actually in my life, rape anyone. (Well actually I do worry if i will do it on accident or when drunk or something, but much less often..) anyways, What i cant get over are these questions: “Do i like it? Do i actually secretly want this to happen to them? Do I want to do this to them? What kind of human being does this make me?” It’s less about me actually taking the action and more about if I WANT it to or checking if i LIKE the thought. Can someone please give me some insight??? Pleaseeee. I feel as if this isnt what is it and im terrified..",Can someone please tell me if I sound like I have OCD??!?!?!?!?

OCD,"Hi everyone!

I'm sure there's quite a few of you that struggle with this combination and know what it can be like. I've had anxiety and OCD ever since I was a kid, but the panic,  dpdr and existential OCD has been around since the end of 2010.

Usually I'm able to cope (mainly through distraction lol) but I'm just having a rough couple of days and hoping that someone on here has found healthy ways of coping/overcoming these - maybe even little tips from therapy or something!

When all of these feeling flair up I'm ashamed to say it but I instantly fall into bad depressions and feel suicidal despite trying to think of pretty much anything else (hormones throughout the month don't help either..).

Anyway, any advice or help would be hugely appreciated. I hope you're all doing well ❤️","Existential OCD, DPDR and panic."

OCD,"Warning: this may trigger my fellow existentialists in here!!

So i deal with obsessions and doubt here and there because i have constant dissociation.

So here's the obsession i'm stuck in right now:

While i think there are infinite ways to live, and each fragment of infinity could flower into much more infinite possibilities (and by infinite i mean, there are Ecosexual people out there who enjoy having sex with a tree, or people with so many different interests and desires) 

And given the fact that we are raised a certain way by human society to act a certain way within a certain social frame (that if we delve into it, we may choose to live differently than other ""normal"" people)

OCD,"I have OCD, not entirely sure this is OCD but it could be, I can't tolerate any physical discomfort anymore and the minute a task is even slightly difficult I lose all motivation and just despair. I'm talking really simple things like walking and doing chores. My mind focuses in on these minor discomforts which I feel like I ordinarily wouldn't even notice and makes them a massive deal in my head. I know this might sound like depression and I'm definitely not happy right now but I have no trouble getting out of bed, washing, eating etc. so don't that's likely. 

For example, I was walking my dog today and it wasn't strenuous but because I didn't want to be doing it, every step felt like a chore and this really minor ache in my leg was exaggerated massively. I just have no tolerance for anything anymore. I still get the job done but it's way more miserable than it should be.

I'm just locked onto this and noticing things like this all day. I have no idea how to deal with this stuff. Tried ERP, tried being mindful and letting it pass. This kind of works sometimes but it's unrelenting. I really don't wanna be on SSRI's if I can avoid it but this is making me reconsider.

Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this and would they have any idea how to deal with it? This is easily one of the weirdest manifestations of OCD I've had. Closest thing I've been able to find online is obsession with bodily sensations.

OCD,What do you do if someone that you hurt won’t respond when you text them? Years ago I hurt someone and I haven’t been able to speak to them out of fear so I decided to get the number from somebody and I text them. They never responded so I didn’t send them a voicemail again never responded. Now I’m thinking what if they never got the message because they have their phones filtered so we can message people that they know? Or will they never check my voicemail? Should I call the private? I did something horrible I don’t know if it’s in basis to force them speak to me by calling privately any advice would be very welcome,Do I keep trying to apologize ? No response from victim
OCD,"What I’m experiencing I’ll use this analogy for. Say I’m playing a game like GTA5 or something. My character is my body and I am my mind. Say I’m playing but then I put down the controller and go make a drink. The character still stands there, maybe performs some simple actions, but the mind isn’t really consciously doing them and is busy with something else.

I know there are degrees to dissociation. I don’t really know what people mean by out of body experiences, I assumed that meant like I can see myself from the other side of the room or something. But I feel like my mind is mostly disconnected from my body for a short period of time (usually less than 20 minutes). This is mostly happening in lessons. To everyone else around me, I’m concentrating and engaging in the lesson, I’m nodding my head, giving simple answers like ‘yeah’ (if I’m asked to answer a question about what was said I’ll usually come back to ‘the real world’ but not be able to answer it and will just lock up and be awkward). I still hear noises from real life but they don’t translate to words or meaning, maybe I’ll pick up the odd word here and there but definitely not a sentence and I can’t remember anything meaningful. 

It feels like I’m a ghost looking through the eyes of a separate autonomous block of flesh but trapped in a world of thought rather than reality. 

Whether this is dissociation of not, it’s really fucking up my revision/learning etc. 

It also happens at night a lot. Like I’ll be downstairs about to make a cup of tea but I’ll just stand there trapped in my head, maybe look around a bit but it takes fucking 15 minutes for me to make that cup of tea.

Any responses will be appreciated, thanks :)",Can someone explain what dissociation is like? I don’t know if it is what I keep experiencing

OCD,"I had an argument with my girlfriend last night. The night before she told me that no matter how bad my OCD gets and no matter what happens, she promises she’s not going anywhere. Of course my OCD didn’t listen to that and instantly assumed that because we had an argument the next day that she might leave me or wanna go on a break. I know that’s ridiculous and the OCD is just lying to me, but I tried to sit with it and instead spent all night throwing up. I feel somewhat better now, and this morning she gave me some of her hoodies to wear while she goes back home for a bit and she said I love you and joked around with me, and I apologised for the argument. She seems fine and I know she’s not going anywhere but these thoughts just keep coming and I don’t want to be sick again. Like I literally got a thought saying “she’s only giving you her hoodies so you can wear them for the last time before she might leave you or go on a break”. That’s so stupid right? What’s even more frustrating is that this month two years ago we had a short breakup for a couple of weeks and my OCD is relating to things that happened before that happened two years ago to events that happen currently, so part of me is scared and thinking “what if it happens again?” even though I’ve been told a lot it won’t and we are pretty happy right now. I don’t know, OCD is just a massive convincing asshole sometimes.

Right now I'm sitting down while writing this on my computer, I have 2 chandelures, one to my left and other a bit to my right.. I have the need to look at the left one first and the second one after in a specific order and speed (I usually just look through the corner of my eye)

OCD,I added support for flair because i want that but also have a question.

When my mom accidentally touches my butt or some other area i just dont do anything for two seconds and let it happen because in the moment i think i like it or want it to happen and it happened a few minutes ago. I felt kind of turned on thinking this is hot even though i do not view my mom sexually and would never do anything w her bc that is absolutely disgusting. Anyway after those two seconds i moved away and sort of jumped back. But it feels like i had acted on something and i immediately started feeling gross and like i did something with my mom. Incest completely disgusts me and i get a lot of ocd thoughts about unwanted sexual thoughts w her and i get disgusted so why do i like it when these things happen???? I also have a bf and i feel like i cheated on him in the most foul way even if nothing much happened. I dont know if I should tell him so he can get out of a relationship with someone as sickening as me. It sort of felt like i froze up bc i liked it or something but then i decided to move. I should have moved quicker than i did and not have felt the way i did. I feel sick to my stomach please help,I dont know why my brain is like this
OCD,"Throwaway account. I've not been diagnosed with OCD, I'm here because some of my loved ones have suggested I do some research.

I've been looking into OCD and there's a lot of stuff I identify with but there's even more I don't. I've been battling anxiety (and winning) for the last 13 years of my life. Went to therapy for GAD years ago but got frustrating by the format and stopped going. I've abused weed and booze since I was 15 because I feel like I can't get any peace without something that alters my mind. Whilst it has been terrible in the past I am now in a place where it's manageable.

I spend all my time trying to improve who I am as a person and I think I've done an incredible job. The scared, anxious little boy I used to be would be excited to see who I am today... but I still get intense feelings of failure. Logically know I am a decent person but no matter how much I try to rationalise that with myself I get into these dark loops of self hate that convinces me I'm a degenerate.

My work flow is sporadic. 14 hour work days followed by 2 hour work days. When I finish a long day of work I've never achieved enough. The anxiety makes it impossible to work sometimes; I'll be sitting at my desk with all my programs up but make zero progress because I'm thinking about not making progress.

OCD,"Hi all:) I hope you're doing okay on your way to recovery. 

My OCD symptoms have decreased a bit I would say. I still have occasional bad days, but not as bad as the weeks prior. 

However, something I still struggle with is having a good sleep rhythm as well as motivation to do things. 

Basically, I can't fall asleep before 2 am, sometimes even 3 or 4 am. I sleep at least 10 hours, sometimes up to 12. My whole day is just gone then. I hate it and yeah, I kinda criticize myself a lot when it comes to this. I have tried a special alarm clock but it doesn't work. However, if I need to get up for an appointment, I will do it. But that's more the exception, I'm lacking structure.

Now, I have already tried to create a structure. I have plenty of things I would love to do. But then I don't. It's like something is keeping me from doing it. Like something's holding me back. This means I don't do things I would enjoy and that would help me feel better - sports, eating better food, reading.

OCD,"Just joined this subreddit today, and honestly reading about the posts in this community have made me feel less lonely. So I just wanted to tell you guys about my journey.

Many post I’ve seen about OCD, more specifically PureO, often mention a “guilt” and for me, it certainly stemmed from my cocaine addiction I used to struggle with a couple years ago. Fortunately, I was able to stop, but the recovery process (Approx. span of 1 year) involved a lot of ruminations where I would have no drive or energy to do anything, rather just sit/lay in bed and constantly say the same reassurance over and over and over again until it just... felt right? After recovering for about a year, these thoughts have seemed to stop, and for a second, I was super proud of myself. No more laying in bed for 2-3 hours at a time thinking the same thoughts over and over. My nose/septum was pretty messed up due to my past usage and coke’s known to form a hole in your nose in chronic users due to the deterioration. But fortunately I don’t have a hole in my septum, but I do have a skinny septum now. 

It wasn’t until recently that I’ve randomly started having these thoughts again. A constant worry about a hole forming in my nose. I don’t do that stuff anymore, but if I do, I’ll just gum a little here and there, but never snorting through my nose. Although I know I didn’t do enough of it in the past to form a hole in my septum, I constantly seek self-reassurance through long lasting ruminations which involve squeezing my nose together to reassure myself that my septum is fine. Usually, I’d reassure myself once and that would be fine for me. But recently, I’ve been having this deadly urge to do it over and over until it just feels right, but it’s been getting so much harder to reach that “sweet spot” to ease my anxiety. I feel like my septum is getting skinnier and skinnier which causes me to do it over and over again. I know that I have no reason to worry about it, but I still do. And this is what’s driving me crazier every single day. I used to ruminate for multiple hours multiple times a day, but I’ve been able to reduce it from multiple hours to multiple minutes. Even though I’ve been able to reduce it down, I’ve noticed that I’m starting to develop an urge to do it more frequently. I don’t know how to stop these urges. I’ve read everything, but I just can’t seem to prevent these thoughts from coming into my head. It’s getting so much more tiring, I can’t even study anymore, dread going to work, and would rather just lay in my bed doing absolutely nothing besides watching Youtube videos or scrolling through social media because it gets my mind off of it. I go to sleep with these thoughts and instantly wake up with them every single day.

OCD,"I have never owned a bathroom scale. When I was in high school a decade ago, I developed an exercise obsession. I’d go to the gym for at least an hour every single day. After my long workout, I’d always go into the locker room and get on the scale. This, of course, turned into an unhealthy obsession with my weight. I was never really underweight and my mom praised me for taking such an interest in my “health”, but it messed with me mentally for a long time and I realized that I needed to stop because I was bordering on eating disorder territory. I went to the gym less and made a very conscious effort to avoid the scale. This is before I was officially diagnosed.

Recently, I went to the doctor and found out I have slightly high cholesterol. My weight was also not where I was hoping it would be. Not overweight, but not a number I would be comfortable disclosing to loved ones. My SO and I are making an effort to be healthier these days because we want to live long happy lives and also look great for our wedding next year. I was working out three times a week, but with the recent discoveries at the doctors office I decided to increase that to five days a week. We don’t leave the house much these days for obvious reasons and I want to do what I can to be healthy, so I thought I’d set a goal wedding weight. My doctor approved of the goal weight, but now I’ve reached a conundrum...

Do I buy a bathroom scale?

Pros: it would help me keep an eye on my weight to make sure I don’t keep gaining it, it would encourage me to keep exercising if I see some results (even very mild results), it would give me something concrete to hold myself to when it comes to health goals

Cons: the obsessions I had in high school could come back in full swing

OCD,"Ok so this is a rant. I have OCD, and I have been fixated on angel numbers for the last year. I constantly have weird synchronicites with numbers where I have an intrusive thought like I am going to hurt someone I love, and I look at the clock and it says 222. It's really freaking me out, but part of me knows that confirmation bias and subconscious awareness plays a part in this, and sometimes weird coincidences with no supernatural origin will happen. I'll scroll through media and say ""universe, give me a sign that I'm gonna hurt this person that I love (I'm leaving this vague, but it's a specific violent  obsession I have) and then boom I'll scroll and see a mirror number or angel number and it scares the hell out of me.

OCD,"I've been dealing with a particularly nasty obsessive flare up after dealing with years of horrible intrusive thoughts ranging from pretty much every Pure O-type obsession topic one can have. I've never spoken to a soul about it in about 7 years. So I've never actually been diagnosed. There a lot of reasons why I have never spoken to someone about it.

1. Terrified that I actually wont get diagnosed with OCD and whoever is seeing me will try to section me/contact the police/put me on a potential harm watch-list or even try to tell me that my thoughts are real and try to council me on how do deal with it. 
2. I'm also scared of an official diagnosis in that I really want to be able to adopt children one day and some mental diagnoses mean you're unlikely to be allowed to adopt. 
3. The diagnostic criteria for OCD doesn't seem to cover pure-o and its not exactly very well known about so I worry that the person assessing me will just see it as a box ticking exercise and I won't fill that criteria because I don't have physical compulsions.
4. The idea of having an assessment and talking to someone about the most f\*cked up stuff in my head over ZOOM just sounds like an absolute nightmare. 

I'm so desperate for a diagnosis though, for even just to tell someone because keeping it in makes it so much worse and further exacerbates the feelings and fears of secretly being a monster.",UK Pure O sufferers - How did you approach getting help for it?
OCD,"So I have a compulsion related to the fear of losing precious things of mine. I will have uncontrollable thoughts about how I will lose my teeth if I don't do this or that.

OCD,"TW: Pedophilia, cancel culture, abuse, sex, incest, rape  


Before beginning the post I want to clarify that I'm under treatment right now, so a lot of the things I now know thanks to the team of professionals that were and are working with me right now (And that i've been lucky to find my old therapist, who helped me through that stage of my life a long time ago):  


I always had sexual related OCD (Aside from many other things within my OCD, but they doesn't come to the case of what I want to vent today), in which I would fear that I actually liked my mother and intrusive thoughts about her or figures like Virgin Mary (not a Christian any longer but was raised pretty Christian so that stuff stuck with me) naked or being raped and I asked to myself: Do I like this? What if this is exciting me?

And that is something I worked a lot on therapy back in the day, but I dropped out of therapy sometime around 2014, and I was pretty much on my own since back then. The times I wanted to take again, I had all bad experiences and never found my old therapist contact to be with her.   
So this stuff ranged from being pretty obsessed and stressed about it for months, to calm me down and have the blessing to talk with people around me who understood my situation.

So, fast-forwarding and omitting the stuff in the middle (Else this is going to be even longer):

It was the mid-2020s, and quarantine here (Argentina) was pretty severe and long (In theory, we still are in quarantine). I was under heavy depression and anxiety, and all of a sudden I started to read a lot of people on Twitter being outed for being child groomers, pedophiles, and stuff. That's when it has begun. I knew I did stuff that was cancellable back in my late teens and I was digging thru my memory, and I recalled some of those things. I started to feel unforgivable, that I have committed the ultimate sin, that anytime soon I was going to be called out and canceled. But what was worst is that it started revolving around the idea of me being a Pedophile or a Groomer.  I remembered that I was an asshole with people and that I experienced some sort of backlash in a Facebook group I used to be. And in this memory, I was between 18 and 20, and I was flirting with a 14-year-old child on Facebook. I kind of started to believe that more and more, didn't have where to look for actual proof or who to ask about it. So I was asking everyone around me if I was a pedophile, that I have done this, that I believed that happened. The answers ranged from my uncle saying that he didn't remember that (I used to speak to him about my problems where I wasn't on therapy and I wouldn't have hidden this from him) and the rest of my family saying it wasn't a big deal, that I should let go of it.

So I started to speak to friends from here, which said that sucks but it's all right if I can understand that was wrong. But I was convinced I was a pedo and that I deserved punishment, torture, and death.   
I ended up talking with someone who was my friend on Twitter (We share the same interest and pursue visual arts) after they talked to me about the pedophile behavior of someone being outed and I started 'confessing' in a parade of telling them that I was feeling guilty and anxious about it, that I supposed that I'm better than this people... and then asking constantly ""Am I better than this people? Was I a pedo? Are we still friends?"" of course it didn't end well after pushing them around for a couple of times. But I had what I was looking for, reassurance and punishment: they told me everything I wanted to hear, from the part that I was a child predator and have no way to be better, to tell me that I was acting like I was acting because ""I was caught"". 

I believed them, thanked them, and move out from Twitter for... like a month apparently, I ended creating another account because I wanted to keep looking at these call-outs and punish myself.  
And I couldn't do anything, I couldn't study, I couldn't draw, if I drew I did just one line and perhaps finish it days later if I shared art on a server or with someone it was after a long time.   
I remember that back in this time my sister got tested for Covid-19 twice and I was pretty stressed over it too.

I finally decided to get help and met a therapist online, we were doing great and she made me see all these stuff were related to OCD, we worked a couple of months and it helped a lot, but ended leaving in some sort of breakdown (plus she has some views of the world I didn't agreed with a lot and made me a little iffy) 

From there I've spent time going to one, and another, until like some miracle, my old therapist contact appeared on the internet. And I tried sending her an email... and she answered!  
From then I have my sessions with her and updated her on my status. What happened next is that I talked to her about these events, and she told me what happened (She still has my clinical notes, which I didn't expect)   
So I wasn't 20, it was in 2011, it was between my 16-17, I was a dropout of hs and I was all day every day in my home because I was afraid to get out because I was robbed and they tried to kidnap me on a trip (This is why I started treatment originally). So I entered a bunch of Facebook groups of fandoms that I wasn't really that interested but I wanted people to be friends with. And somehow people hated me for, I guess that I was pretty much an annoying edgy, weird, stupid dude. So one day I kind of blow up and sent all of them to screw with the most hurtful stuff I could say to people who had actually suffered heavy stuff. With also being kind of creepy with the girls of the group saying to everybody that I liked them because I knew they were already mad with me. And that years later I apologized to most of them and my apologies was received positively.   


Now I don't know in which part of my mind has fitted the story of me and a 14-year-old. I never dated anyone more than two age younger than me, and even if I had some creepy behavior in my 19s it wasn't grooming minors.

I still battle with two thoughts: one is the fear of cancel culture, that if I get successful in what I like this person might come and say ""No, don't trust this person is a pedo he told me this"" and how do I explain myself? Who is going to believe me when I say that my mind fucked me up? I will forever be shunned and even if people understand, what I did is still unforgivable and people will shun me anyway. I imagine the discourse over and over again, imagine my defense, her statement, mine, people taking opinions on it, people bullying me. I live this situation in my head nearly every second of my life.

And the second is the fear that I actually I'm lying to myself, to all my therapists, and that I'm actually a pedophile and sexual predator that is manipulating her and everyone around me to believe me and not being held accountable for my tremendously heinous crimes. If not, why would have been obsessed with this? Why would I put something that wasn't real as real in the first place?

And something that helps me to feed the second thought is that I actually ended sympathizing with someone who I thought was unfairly canceled because people didn't let him grow up from his mistakes... but then I learned his ""mistakes"" were a year ago... and watching the victim's video I learned that he was actually manipulating everything and was an actual groomer, and I felt stupid to sending him my support thinking that it was all hysterical cancel culture. And again, if I defended a pedophile, then I should be one, and I'm manipulating everyon-AAAAAH I CAN'T TAKE THIS SHIT ANYMORE! It doesn't matter if I have logic, and facts (what my therapist told me about the incident) I still having this thoughts and is stressful as fuck...

Thanks to anyone who read up on here, I know it is a long post, but even with therapy, I feel lonely and that I don't have many people to talk about my OCD and what's causing me. Most people around me got sick of me asking every time for reassurance. And still, I fear that what I really did is even cancellable and I must be thrown into a hole forever.

This space though makes me feel a lot better, and that I'm not alone. I see a lot of posts of people struggling with the same or almost the same issues, and I feel companion. Thank you.","My struggle: POCD, real events, false memories, cancel culture."
OCD,"Ok so I have suffered with Pure O type obsessions/thoughts for years now (not diagnosed, read previous posts if you are curious as to why I have not been diagnosed) I'm certain I have OCD, surely I must do considering the mental rituals, routines, intrusive thought loops etc that I've had for years. 

So my boyfriend who knows nothing about the whole pure-o thing has recently been begging me to get professional help for what he thinks is OCD (kind of funny to me as he just has no idea about the 7 years of OCD-like thoughts that I've had). I have this issue with people touching my things, specifically my clothes and my bedding. I kind of categorize people as 'dirty people' and 'clean people' and if someone touches my clothes then I have to wash it because its now dirty, I get very upset if I can't wash it. Bed sheets are the same, I wash my bed sheets every day and struggle to cope with it if they are not clean. I personally never thought this could be related to OCD as I don't have any particular intrusive thoughts of anyone getting hurt if I don't do it but I definitely get thoughts like 'you're going to look like a gross dirty person if you don't wash it' and 'that person has made your clothes smell and be dirty now they've touched it'.

OCD,"My sister has OCD and I attribute aspects of the disorder to her behavior but I also don't understand her form of OCD.

But she's never that way with me or my mom. She blames me or my mom for her issues and has punched walls or has outbursts when I fail to do things she's asked of me that aren't even serious. It's like she comes home and releases her upsets on me primarily. I'm on the Autism spectrum myself, and also have panic disorder and generalized anxiety, and CPTSD. I also study psychology but I've never found anything about the abusive aspect of the disorder. I don't believe OCD innately makes anyone abusive or volatile but I don't know what else it could be as she sees a therapist and they've never diagnosed her with anything else. And she's said herself she can't distinguish her OCD from her personality, which I understand as I have my own issues but I'm at a loss for want to do besides stop interacting with her altogether.

OCD,"Hi, I know this isn’t really a typical post here but I do believe I have ROCD and most people on this sub are much more understanding and nonjudgmental than relationship subs.
So I’ve been with my bf for over a year and a half although we did for a few weeks over 2 years ago now but I didn’t fancy him enough so I broke it up but stupidly kissed someone a few hours before I ended it - feel absolutely horrible and guilty enough for this please don’t hate on me.
Anyway, we got back together 6 months later, I confessed and he forgive me. I started to get suspicions about his female friend and if they had any history so I asked him. Initially he lied about it and said nothing ever happened between them but then he fessed up 10 mins later and told me they had had sex more than once in the past. Obviously was before we were together so I wasn’t mad I was just upset he lied to me and tried to hide it. Anyway that was almost a year ago and I let it slide, moved on but I let him know at that time that his friendship with her made me slightly uncomfortable. Anyway, summer came along and I noticed he was super weird with his phone. He would open all his other friends Snapchat’s bar hers if I was next to him, I ignored it for a few weeks but then brought it up and he said he didn’t even realise blah blah. Then the next time he opened her message in front me she happened to call him “boo” which I guess can be friendly but also not comfortable with someone calling my boyfriend of a year, boo. Once again, ignored it. 
Then last night I got the urge to go on his phone. Which I do not condone and I think it is such a stupid thing to do! But if I hadn’t, I wouldn’t have found him telling her his new address on the 2nd day I had moved back into my uni accommodation an hour away from him in September last year. I was on his phone for approx 30 seconds and as soon as I seen that realised I was being a stupid idiot and left it. But now I’ve seen this and I’m worried.
I don’t tbink he’d cheat, or anything like that. But the fact of the matter is, he knows I am not the most comfortable with their friendship but he still decided to invite her round to his flat alone and didn’t tell me because he obviously knows that I wouldn’t think it was okay.
I believe if there’s something you’re doing that you don’t want to tell your SO about it then you shouldn’t be doing it. 
I had absolutely no idea this happened, I didn’t think they had seen each other since summer last year and I’m a little upset. Although my anxiety is telling me that I’m the worst person ever for the way I found this out and that it’s all my fault and he deserves someone better anyway and I have no right to be upset because of what I did 2 years ago. I have a bad compulsion of confession stupid irrelevant stuff but my mind is telling me I need to tell him this or I’m a horrible person. I also have a bad compulsion of looking up what other people think online and everyone seems to think snooping is horrible which I agree with it but I only was on his phone for literally 2 seconds. Ugh I don’t know I feel so shit

OCD,"When I was diagnosed with ocd my doctor told me a bit about it but also told me to read up on it. When I did I KNEW I had it since I was a child. I remember not being able to sleep at night because I was focused on my breathing, heart rate and the deafening sound of silence. Even as a child I was overly concerned about my health thinking I was going to die if I didn’t pray or drink water at certain times. In class I would move my eyes in different shapes and count how many times I did it. (Teachers thought I had adhd because I would be too occupied doing stuff like this). I remember as a child when going on car rides thinking about how I was the only person who can experience my reality and just feeling an intense amount of sonder. I would spend way too much time thinking about how everyone had their own complex lives and I would think about where they would be going, what their name could be, family etc etc. I get overly aware of how my arms and legs are positioned when I’m talking to someone.

OCD,"I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and OCD when I was about 12 years old. I used to be more compulsive but that went away with age. Emphasis was always put on my depression and I have never given much thought into the OCD diagnosis I recieved back then.

Fast forward. I am in my late twenties, married and just had my first child 18 months ago. Having my child has exasperated all of my mental illnesses. I had bad depression during pregnancy and after the birth. I am still on the highest dose of Lexipro. Lately its not cutting it. I feel imprisoned in my own mind. 

I want to be clear that I love my child with every fiber of my being. I have a good life and am fully functional. I work full time and have been trying to get into dental hygiene. I am a top employee at my work and come off as an extrovert. People say i brighten the workplace and am fun to be around. However, when I am at work, I get about 2 near panic attacks a day. No one would be able to tell this though except that I do get a little edgy. I constantly think my coworkers are thinking bad thoughts about me or that they are talking bad about me behind my back. Its plagues me and follows me 24/7. I can't even have interactions with people any more. I latch on to innocent parts of conversations and twist and turn it into something that seems like an attack.

I keep realizing that I should have never been a mother or that my kid and husband would be better off if I just took off and disappeared. I suspect my husband thinks I'm crazy and just tolerates me while also thinking negative thoughts about me. 

I feel this impending psychotic break is coming. That a dramatic change needs to happen in my life or I may become more of a burden. 

I don't know what this is. Like I said, my whole life it was that I had depression and anxiety and the OCD was just a funny quirk. But now, as I reflect, I realize it may be the root cause of everything that is wrong with me.

I'm so terrified of being aroused by the things mentioned that I have had to move to all online college courses and I don't leave my house or spend any time with my family.

OCD,"TW: sexual assault, miscarriage, pregnancy




For some background, I do not want (at least bio) children and never have. I have had a miscarriage before due to an unplanned pregnancy. I am also a sexual assault survivor. All of those things could be contributing to this, but I just want to know if anyone else struggles with this or has any suggestions on how to mitigate this. 

I have always experienced this and only recently thought that this could potentially be either caused entirely by my OCD or at least made worse by it. 

Any time I have sex, I get INTENSE fear that I am pregnant. This anxiety is to the point that I have often caused my periods to be late, which only exacerbates the fear.

I have been on birth control before, and the phobia was still there because of that .01% chance a person can get pregnant on birth control. With any contraceptive I use, I extensively research. Of course, no method (except abstinence lol) is 100% effective, and I always find myself struggling to enjoy sex or feeling “dirty” after sex partially because I am so scared that I will get pregnant. 

The anxiety about being pregnant and obsessiveness about checking stats and basically begging my period to start is really detrimental to my life. It’s been detrimental to relationships before due to me not wanting to have sex.

It’s so scary. It is also just plain embarrassing. I know I am being crazy, I know I am worried about “nothing”... I am fully aware, which makes me feel even more alone and ashamed. 

Every single person in my life that I have opened up to about OCD has said something along the lines of “I don’t think you have it”. It’s because I am not washing my hands every 5 minutes. But it is very real for me in other ways. I can’t sleep, eat, study and I keep having to leave work early. 

How do you deal with the stigma? I feel like I cannot open up to anyone because no one will understand what I am going through.",Do you ever feel like no one ever really understands your OCD?

but it did make me immediately think ""are we not all doing that? Is that not normal"".....and apparently, no.  It made me realize that I, too am stuck in that obsessive cycle. 

I will not buy any food that I can't cook (so, no fresh produce), I use gloves to transfer all food to new packaging when we get groceries, takeout has to be done with gloves on and the food has to be put on the floor so it doesn't contaminate seats.

I was in my naitive and I sent a nude to my friend and he sent me back and I used to masturbate while thinking about it for at 5 to 7 days but I felt weird that I didn't wanna be bi so then I stopped jerking off to him. 
When I came home I used to get anxiety that I'm bi and used to get scared that I might get aroused or masterbate thinking about him and one day I was masturbating I thought of him while Orgasming and I came. After that I got so much anxiety I used to get so scared that I'm bi and used to cry for hours I now feel I'm in denial after 2 months my dad took my to a doctor and he diagnosed me with OCD after that I felt ok coz I knew its my ocd and after that another theme came -schizophrenia ocd that time I used to jerk off thinking about girls and I felt good

OCD," 

Hi everyone! I have suffer from OCD for around 6 six years. The theme of my OCD is about masturbation. I always have the scene of masturbation in the public area. During these six years, the most severe stage of my OCD is the first two years. At the time, I was suffered from instantly false memory, urge and impulse and false memory OCD. I also have vivid images in my mind. I can not distinguish the difference between a through and an action. It is because no matter you act out these actions or not, you brain still pretend it really happens. Also, when you try to retrieve your memory, you can only retrieve your false memory scene or nothing. It seems like the RAM of my brain was disappear. I can not remember the actions I acted out, which was just a few seconds ago.

Regarding to the physical compulsion behaviors, I always check whether I am wearing my trousers or not within a certain interval of time. It is because I have the impulse of taking off my trousers off and do some embarrassing actions. In some occasions, such as shopping center and school, I do produce more false memories and compulsion. Sometimes, through action fusion and false memory can be formed at the same instance. For example, when I experience an intrusive through and impluse, I will pull my trousers in a slightly manner and pretend I am pulling off my trousers intentionally. At the same, I experience a physcual sensation on my skin because of these movements. Meanwhile, vivid images will form in my brain and I have no idea of what I am doing at that present because I was suffer from foggy memory at that moment. After the whole process, when I reforcus my mind into the present ""realty"", which is the real world situation. I was shocked, I thought I acted out some of the following actions: take off my trouses, masturbation, doing some embrassing behaviors and take on my trouses. In other words, when I refocus into the present ""realty"", it just like I have already resumed into the the situation very similar before the through action fusion begins, such as sit properly and did nothing. Sometimes, you can experience physcial sensation even if you do not carring out physcial compulsion. The reason why I will try to simulate the action of pulling off my trouses is because I will to experience the differences between through and action. Also, the pure ocd makes think that if I really carry out these actions, I will be releaxed from the anxiety. However, the more I do reassurance and do these simulation actions. I produce more anxiety about my OCD and the simulation. I worried about what if I really acting out these thought during the simulation. Also, it is possible that I am crazy and really acting out these thought to realse my pressures without considering any consequences.

Under some circumstances, OCD will not make you feel anxious and pressure but it makes you feel relax instead. In these situation, what I worry about is that:

NO1:  
Why did not experiencing any anxiety at all?

NO2:  
Will I I act out these through automatically ? It is because it makes me feel I am safe and just like I am at home.

NO3: OCD can fake my subconscious and say "" Here is your home and you can masturbate here. You can use your OCD bug which is the foggy memory to fake your mind. You can pretend the people around you do not exist or it does not mattet, you just masturbation at all cost.

The reason why I am scared is because sometimes you really did something but you can not remember. For example, in real life situation, sometimes you can not remember what you have said before just a few seconds ago. One example is that my lecturer did not remember what he was talking about after he answered the question raised by one of my schoolmate. Also, OCD can merge different memories into one memory. It can exaggerate the situation. For example, a few seconds later after you tied your shoelaces, OCD makes your think that you take off your schoes and socks and wear them back and tie your shoelaces. It makes me feel crazy.

Fortunately, I did lesser and lesser compulsion in these days, I know the term of thought and fusion and magical thinking. I know that when I was severe in OCD situations. It just like a blind people walking down the road. The ultimate decision is under your control. I can decide at that second but I can not rely on any of my memory even a few seconds ago.

The problem is that will I harm myself even I notice what I am doing at that particular second? Will I hurt myself even I know I am hurting myself in terms of real situations at all cost. In other words, I am huring myself physiologically even I notice the real alert signal with clear mind but not the falsely signal of the OCD.

Now, I also suffer from OCD. I did not produce any new themes, but as a OCD sufferer, I suffer the OCD that OCD the past OCD. If the theme of my past OCD is washing my hands, I will not OCD that OCD. However, my theme is about masturbation. I really want to cry.

Q1.Did anyone experience what I have experienced?

Q2.Did anyone use a video recorder to recoder their own behavior before ?

For example, you wrote down your OCD thought action fusion and the things that OCD makes you think you have done and view the video and see whether you have done these action or not.😭😭😭😭

At last, I want say foggy memory is horrible. Now I am seeing cp and mental docotor. I really want to know the answers of the last two questions Q1 and Q2.

OCD,"I've been dealing with this for a long time and i think its time to get some awnsers. I'm just doing the very best i can to self improve

- i have an urge sometimes to talk to myself. Like if i think of something funny i just laugh to myself. Sometimes i mutter or mumble to myself. For some reason i just have to say whatever it was i was thinking.

- i used to have feelings of dread when i thought about sad things like death, rape or anything tragic.

- i tend to have intrusive thoughts. I do tend to have weird like WEIRD thoughts like juat random bullshit and it goes away but it's still pretty weird like ""what would it be like to have sex with my mom"" like it gets really weird.

- i tend to replay things over and over again. Any little incidents, criticisms and painful memories i overthink about it. Everyday for the last 8 months i thought about a bullying incident that caused me to have depression and it was always in the back of my head man.

- i tend to act weird, like socially awkward. I tend to sometimes overthink every little movement i do. From getting up from a chair, to walking and talking. I just examine every little thing i do to mot screw myself up.

- i always had trouble with sleeping. It's hard for me to just relax and take a nap and it took me almost an hour to fall asleep. Lately I've been having sleep deprivation and it's killing me man.

- i tend to replay parts, do repetitive behaviors. Like if I'm listening to a certain song and i love it, i play it to a specific part of the song i like every 5 sec.

Its such a disgusting feeling because a child shouldn't not want to become their father it makes me feel bad because he's not a bad person (debatable but) he's just very sick and I know he's been fighting wars 24/7 so a part of me has empathy for his shit side.

An exterminator came on Tuesday and put out some stuff that would draw them all out of the wall and then kill the whole colony. It's Saturday now and it's getting better but they're still everywhere, including the bed. I've been sleeping on the floor in the living room (I live with my parents and sister) since Tuesday night and not having access to my own personal space and alone time is kind of making me freak out. This has been one of the worst weeks of my life for several reasons in addition to the ants and I feel like I am perpetually on the verge of a mental break. I am taking five college classes online in addition to working on transfer applications and I am literally so exhausted physically and emotionally and all I want to do is be alone in my own space to sleep and relax and recharge but I can't because I literally don't have my own space right now. I can't focus on my work because there's nowhere to be alone, and falling behind is making me panic even more. I feel like my family thinks I'm being overly dramatic refusing to sleep in my own bed until the ants are all totally gone and I'm inconveniencing everybody by taking over the living room but just the thought of going back there right now makes me panic.

Basically I drink a lot of water, but I only drink it with some foods, which is totally normal. But I have to brush my teeth before I ever drink water, especially if I have eaten. If I’m unable to brush my teeth or am too lazy to do it, I will go hours without drinking or I’ll drink soda or some type of flavored drink. I feel like the food that I have eaten will flavor the water (I’m about to gag thinking about it). Sodas or flavored drinks kills the food flavor I guess. I also can’t drink water if I just drank a soda or flavored drink. It’s like the soda leaves a coating in my mouth then when I drink water it gets inside the water. I hope I explained that well lol.

Hey guys,

So tried to stay off this for a while as i used to be on this for hours every single day. Recently over last couple of days I have really wound myself up so much with anxiety due to my fears and thoughts. I’m stuck in a loop of fears of schizophrenia. All the obsessive thoughts like what if people want to hurt me, what if government are out to get me, what if my food is poisoned or my family have poisoned it. Causing absolutely horrible spikes of anxiety. I try and rationalise it everytime but it seems to grow even stronger. I never realised anxiety could cause thoughts like this, I’ve been obsessing over this for around 3 months now and my thoughts come and go and usually die down at night but in the morning they just ramp up. The bad thing is I don’t know if anyone else does this but I feel like I think of the thoughts on purpose to see if I react to them or I’ll create the scenario or thought in my head? Does anyone else do this? One more thing do intrusive thoughts always start with “what if” or can they start with anything?? For example instead of “what if the foods poisoned” just before I eat it I’ll maybe have the thought like “it’s poisoned don’t eat it” which then freaks me out because it’s not a what if thought. Just wondering if anyone can relate or has any advice on this? Plus anything I read I seem to latch onto an example of this would be I read that a schizophrenic once said that something went wrong with something they were doing and they blamed someone else for it saying “they’re in on it” right after this is shook me to the core and I started worrying about that thinking “what if they’re in on it against me” absolutely rubbish because there was nothing for anyone to be in on but my thoughts just jumped to that because it was a symptom of what I read about what this person said who had schizophrenia. Can anxiety and OCD do this or am I schizophrenic for having these thoughts? I’m fed up of questioning and rationalising every thought but I feel as if I have to do it mentally to try and calm my thoughts and fears down.

Thanks guys",Fear of schizophrenia.
OCD,"(Sexual tmi here guys so please be aware before reading) 

Hey guys, I just have some questions about HOCD I was hoping you guys may have the answer to. I realized that I was a lesbian when I was 15. My family is quite homophobic so I didn’t come out until last year (I am now 20) and I guess there was a lot of internalized homophobia growing up because of my family situation. So anyway, I’ve been diagnosed with OCD and I have a lot of harm OCD intrusive thoughts and such but one thing I’ve also had my whole life is sexual orientation intrusive thoughts. Ever since I realized I liked girls it got much worse. I constantly question myself. I don’t feel attraction toward guys but I constantly check if I do. When I’m not having the intrusive thoughts, I’m confident in my sexuality and I feel fine and guys really do not do anything for me in that way. However, when I’m having these thoughts, I’m questioning my sexuality, constantly trying to think of guys or put myself into situations in my head to check my reaction to them, and what’s worse is I even feel arousal at times when I experience these intrusive thoughts despite otherwise thinking that the situation would be gross. It’s the arousal too that really gets to me because it makes me think “oh great so this must mean I really am into guys sexually, that’s gross. I don’t want this” and then I start to panic. I even purposefully imagine situations to see if I will get aroused only to feel extremely ashamed afterwards when I in fact will experience arousal. It’s been awful and even during sexual experiences I’ve had with women these intrusive thoughts will occur during it and it ruins it for me because I’ll be thinking “what if this means I want a guy instead? What if I don’t actually like women? Why when I’m experiencing sexual experiences/orgasm/arousal do guys pop up in my head?” and it really bugs me. The thoughts will either cause arousal like I said and/or they gross me out so much i will literally feel sick to my stomach. A few times it’s gotten so bad to a point where I just tell people I’m bisexual because I am so confused by these thoughts and I don’t want to be lying about my sexuality to others and sometimes just saying I’m bisexual to myself makes the thoughts go away because it’s like I’m not fighting them anymore if that makes sense? It just is almost a way for me to be like “okay whatever sure, I’ll just say I’m bisexual then. Please stop” even though it doesn’t sit right with me. I don’t understand why this happens and I guess I’m just wondering if this is OCD or if I actually like guys. Does anyone else experience this or something similar?

OCD,"Tw: Self harm

I have a lot of rules when it comes to numbers and sounds. I'm writing this post as a bit of a confessional as I feel quite ashamed of how much this disorder has taken control of my life. 

I have misophonia and if I hear a trigger sound I have to pinch my thigh 3, 5, or 7 times depending on what it is. The pain of the pinch ""cures"" the repulsed feeling I got from hearing the sound in the first place. But lately the pain has not felt like a cure enough and I'm scared I'll relapse into more extreme self harming, and I've also found myself pinching 3 times for any feeling of disgust, not just the trigger noises. For example I was watching a TV show with a grisly scene and had to pinch. It's getting fairly warm outside but I have to wear long pants all the time to cover the bruises from the pinching.

I also have a fear/superstition around the number 4. When I'm grocery shopping I can only buy 3 or 5 of an item. This used to be an inconvenience but lately I have been applying the ""rule"" to factors and multiples of 4 as well. For example I won't buy 2 because 2x2 is 4. I won't buy 12 because 3x4 is 12. Thankfully I am financially stable but it costs me a lot more over time to follow these arbitrary rules. If I'm eating something and there's 5 pieces left, I'll eat 2 at once to leave 3 behind so I don't have to ""land"" on 4. If I accidentally end up with 4 of something it causes extreme anxiety and panic attacks, sometimes including pinching or scratching myself as well to ""wash away"" the disgust. I don't know how pain became the opposite of disgust in my mind but that's how it is. 

I don't get out of bed if the number 4 is on the clock. I try to avoid looking at the clock when I know there will be a 4. If I see it my heart starts to race and I get a feeling of dread. Usually I can tamp it down and not have an immediate reaction but this past week I had to call in sick as I woke up around 3:30am and then couldn't fall back to sleep before 4am, therefore I ended up staying awake until 5:05 which I felt was a ""safe"" number and I was able to close my eyes and drift off. 

I feel embarrassed admitting to this but it's been getting harder to function. Ive been to a therapist before but I felt too ashamed to admit to my superstitions. There's no doubt it's getting worse but I feel helpless to stop it",Superstitions/rules getting out of control
OCD,"She has been in a a bad state with her depression and hasn't been able to get up the motivation to clean her room and i know what thats like and I wanted to help her in some way because whenever I try to talk with her about how shes feeling she just jokes about it and brushes it off. The room has also been cusping on being a health hazard and the smell has been seeping under her door into the main area for weeks, the cat litter box was full and there was old food and rubbish everywhere..it was bad. But i know what depression is like so I don't judge her for ""letting it get that way"". I knew asking her to clean it would have started a fight and a response of its none of my business. Which i know it isnt. The smell was, but the room isnt. Besides I wanted her to feel better. Needless to say it did not turn out that way.

I know it was crossing a line. I know I wouldn't particularly like it if someone did it to/for me. I would feel uneasy and ask that they not do it again. 

But the impulse won. I feel like I did something nice but also something wrong. I knew it was crossing a big boundary. I didn't go through any personal items nor did I take anything. I still knew that it wasn't right even though i didnt do either of those things.

She is very upset with me, very very upset. And says she doesn't trust me anymore. Which is fair enough, I understand that.

I feel horrible and don't know how to fix it. A big part of me feels like I have to make up for crossing a boundary but another (smaller) part feels like I will be doing more when I already did something.

Similar things happen at work too when someone wants me to do something else and to organise something later. But I do it because they always say that and it always stays messy then I cant find something easily or have quick access to it if i need it. I do realise that cleaning things up at work is different than going into someones personal space. But I mentioned both because both situations are impacting mine and others lives negatively and im constantly stuck in a spiral of shame and for something that (cleaning/organising) isn't typically a negative thing or something one usually feels shameful for.

No I don't want to be told that what I did was ok, but I dont want to be made to feel worse for it either I felt bad as soon as I had the thought, While I was thinking about if i should/will go ahead with it or not, while I was doing it, after I did it and still do now and will probably think about it continually on a loop forever.

OCD,"Yesterday a carton of milk in my fridge went bad. I disposed of it without drinking any of it, but ever since that happened I've had obsessions about all the food in the fridge being bad.

I can't really eat anything without worrying about food poisoning. I had my partner go out yesterday and buy a fresh carton of milk, but even drinking that was difficult for me because of the fears. I also keep opening food, taking a bite, then disposing of it because I'm scared of getting sick. None of the food was actually warm or looked spoiled, but I still am having trouble. 

I have no clue what to do, and the only thing I can think of is throwing the food out and replacing it, but I would hate to waste like that. Anyone experience something similar or have any solutions?","Obsessions about food poisoning, what to do?"
OCD,"I have OCD and one of my compulsions is logging in/clicking around/looking at the class website. 

Well, yesterday in class, my professor mentioned something about being able to see who has accessed course materials, etc.. There are some days when I’ve probably logged in and out close to 100 times in a row. She doesn’t know about my OCD so she is probably super confused/creeped out.

I just tried to put a new ring in, disinfected the skin and the ring with alcohol and salt water but had to immediately take it out because I still felt like it was going to give me an infection.

I hate that I can’t even get myself to do something that I used to love about myself.

OCD,"Hi, I have one of the the most horrible OCD themes imaginable. I don’t want to explicitly state it because I’m too terrified but I was doing well disregarding until something happened.

I had an intrusive thought/urge about a family member and when it happened I forgot that I had OCD. I didn’t act on it but it felt so real and so true that I can’t help but think that it’s my reality. It feels completely different to all the other thoughts. And now I feel like everything has changed, I can’t stop ruminating and wondering why my body felt so inclined to do that thing.

I’m panicking I feel like my fears about myself may be true to some extent and idk how I’m gonna live with myself if they are. I’m seeing a therapist and last session I told her about all the real events from my childhood/teenage that have lead me to believe this about myself. She helped me work through all of them but now I don’t want to go to her with a new thing in the next session.

OCD,"I'm a 19-year-old male college student. I had an incident wherein I had a pattern of adding people on Snapchat from quick add and asking girls out who I barely knew. I was desperate to get a girlfriend because I was happier when I was in a relationship, and therefore I am desperate to get back what I had when I was with someone. I also had a pattern of asking girls to hook up whom I barely knew (I suppose because I didn't understand how hookups work and just assumed it was appropriate to ask a girl unprompted, which I found out through someone complaining to an RA in my building that it is not appropriate). I would ask girls I had talked to for a little while, but whom I still barely knew: ""Would you be offended if I asked you if you wanted to hook up?"" I told my therapist about this, and at his suggestion, I deleted Snapchat with the intention of getting rid of the temptation to ask random girls on dates and ask girls to have sex with me. I'm aware, now, of the inappropriate nature of my behavior and I'm making a concerted effort to stop these behaviors.

Despite this progress (I haven't propositioned a girl I didn't know for a sexual encounter or a romantic relationship in about two weeks now), I am still deathly afraid of my behaviors getting worse and escalating to a point that is either irreversibly damaging to my ability to form and maintain relationships, or even to a point that is criminal. For example, I have been watching videos of people being tried and sentenced for sex crimes and murders, worrying that this is what I will turn into.

I'm very ashamed of what I have done, and very, very terrified that it will escalate to a ""point of no return."" Is this common among people with OCD? I bawled to my therapist about this fear, and he assured me that I will learn and grow and that my fears are irrational, but I am still afraid. Advice would be appreciated.","My therapist says my behaviors are linked to my OCPD and that I will learn and get better, but I'm still afraid of getting worse."

OCD,"Hey all,

Sorry if this is a bit long, will try to keep it short!

Does anyone else really struggle when it comes to other people using the bathroom and trusting they washed their hands? This is where my current issue is starting.

So, basically i work with a close friend, and twice in the last few years, ive seen him leave public bathrooms and not wash his hands (he said he feels the taps are dirty). he knows about my ocd and i think he has been better with hand washing (although at work the other day he used the bathroom when there was no soap in there...)

Today i was at his house as we needed to sort something out for work. He has a new pet who i know has made mess in the house previously, so im getting thoughts of what if it peed or peed on the chair i sat on. I didnt worry to much as my normal routine to make myself feel comfortable, would be to chuck my clothes in the wash basket when i get home and shower, as i get paranoid i could have urine or faeces on my from being at his. I did those things when i got home, and this evening i planned to go to to the shops, but when i got to my car i got all these thoughts of what if there is urine or faeces on my car seat, or on my seat belt from my jumper i wore to his, and i cant get myself to get in my car...

I keep trying to rationalise it and say there wont be anything there, but im so scared there will be and im gonna end up bringing it into my sofa and in my house if i sit in that car seat. 

I guess im posting here as i need an outlet and i dont what else to do as im on a waiting list for therapy currently to help. Is this all just crazy, im so scared of something being in my car, then itll get on my sofa and spread untill everything is contaminated. 

I know some people may think i made it worse by going to my friends house which is fair, but they are such a close friend and i dont want to let ocd ruin this. Ocd already ruins so much, i dont want it to stop me being able to do a simple thing of going to a friends house you know?

OCD,"My OCD seems to attach itself to everything I love-and make me doubt that my love for said thing is authentic and pure or that I deserve to love it.

It all feels so tainted. 

I struggled with these thoughts prior to COVID as well but to a far lesser extent. Why did it have to escalate into this?

OCD,"I was doing really well for a few weeks after I quit drinking, but last week I had a very bad episode where I obsessed over very, very old memories. It sent me into an episode of derealization. Everything is so absurd, I cannot leave the house without my mind warping what I see, what I do or say. I genuinely thought it was getting better and I was glad. It's so severe, I feel that I don't deserve to have friends, I feel that I deserve to die alone. I don't know if I'm a bad man or not, or whether I've done horrible things. But I'm afraid that I'll be exposed for the monster that I am. My memories are so distorted. I cannot imagine the shame people will have for associating with me. I don't even know how I still function normally at my job, I just come off as shy and that's it. Life is so odd, but I'll keep chugging along. I think I'm ok with being alone, I enjoy nature, hiking, bouldering quite a bit. It's surreal but it is what it is. I'm planning on buying a camper van shortly and driving in between cities and working out of co-working spaces. I was surprised to find that the cost of campsite hookups is so high.

It went so bad last year that multiple times my ""getting into bed to sleep ritual""; the proces of standing in front of the bed and laying down in bed took me 15 minutes!!

One time I was laying in the baththub and I saw a youtube recommendation of a documentary of a youtuber with ocd, called Lele Pons

The documentary was not bad, but I cringed because I was ashamed and shocked that I also do very strange things to please my mind. 

This cringe turned into a wake up call and since then my ocd decreased so unbelievably much. 
90% of my rituals that took me ages to complete and made me cry so much are now gone.

I still have some rituals that are hard to dismiss 
(for instance, telling myself multiple times that I love my dog equally as much as my family, I do this because maybe he hears my thoughts? I don't know)

I’ve noticed a number of trigger warnings on this OCD sub. It is by no means every post or even close to majority of the posts, so I’m not saying it is a huge problem. But I wonder what you all think about them? I didn’t grow up with trigger warnings and safe spaces and all the other stuff that has become common over the last 10 years or so. Frankly, they seem quite frivolous to me. Perhaps trigger warnings might make sense for some areas of life, like sexual assault or domestic violence (although there’s a case for them never being useful). But for an OCD sub? Being triggered and provoking anxiety is the entire point. As if exposure and response prevention therapy is going to be nice and comfortable? You will expose yourself to what causes you anxiety, and not do your compulsion, even if you cry nonstop for the entire hour. These warnings and similar things are shields and avoidance.

OCD,"TW: panic attacks, panic disorder, BPD

I think my OCD/AvPD whombo combo is driven by a deep-seated fear of rejection and abandonment.  
The fear of having to be able to fully thrive on my own, with nothing and nobody but me to blame for my suffering.

OCD (at least for me) is the desperate need to address something that is completely outside of my sphere of influence. So far outside in fact, that I can comfortably distract myself from some unaddressed trauma that's festering much closer to home.

Every time I obsess about something or do any type of compulsion, I am taking the scenic route to my destination. It's not really efficient and it's a bumpy ride, but at least I can arrive a little later and avoid my responsibilities a tiny bit longer.

Instead of confronting my primal fear of abandonement and dedicating myself to overcoming it,  
I am remaining in denial of an uncomfortable truth.  
Unfortunately my name is not Cypher. My ignorance is not blissful at all.  
It's easier for me to give in than to stand my ground and do the hard work.  
It's easier to blame a mental disorder than to face my demons.  
It's easier to receive pointless suffering than to actively recover.

I guess growing hurts not only in a physical sense, but also on a psychological level.  
Aching backs and stretching legs have been replaced by emotional turmoil.

Also I think that tics may be a sudden urge to recalibrate your emotions when the anxiety suddenly spikes and threatens to become too much to handle. Maybe they're some sort of reflex to prevent a full blown panic attack, because for me they definitely reset my ability to cope with my emotions.

Does anyone else feel similar with their OCD or OCD-related disorder?

OCD,"I feel like I have had my fair share of OCD. I have suffered from hyperawareness OCD for about 3 years, and only recently I found out what it actually was. My first obsession was swallowing and being extremely aware of how much saliva was in my mouth. After searching up on the web and finding out about this OCD, I used one of the treatments suggested. It was basically just getting comfortable with the thought and sensation of swallowing and it kinda worked. Now I don't stress about it anymore (maybe a bit but that's not my concern for this reddit post). Unfortunately, while I searched for help on Google, most of the articles I read gave examples of obsessions. After reading the list I ultimately gained more obsessions (ironic lol). The one that stood out the most was the obsession of minor itches and pains on the skin. The reason why it stood out so much was because the method I used to help my swallowing OCD relied on the thought of being comforted about it and feeling the nice sensation of it. But obviously, itches and pains aren't a nice sensation to feel. Can someone please give me some help and advice as going to therapy is kinda impossible now with all this covid stuff and I'm not willing to pay for it right now.

OCD,"I don't know if this an OCD fear or not. I have a fear of not receiving treatment the right way. This comes from a long time of not having access to proper help while needing it very badly and being misdiagnosed. I have finally found an OCD specialty clinic but I am scared that I am not receiving treatment the right way. The therapist conducts it in a very slow way. On the internet when they talk about ERP they talk about it like its supposed to be done in this very structured and organized manner and even IOP programs have that sort of structure. But my therapist does it in this slower and more scattered way. A lot of that is because I have a lot of different issues and so we spend time talking about different things sometimes and then we focus on ERP at other times. All of it has to do with the OCD, but we spend a lot of times talking about my life and things. And I keep worrying that it is not the 'right' structure like they talk about ERP on WebMD and things. I don't know if that is a normal way to conduct OCD treatment? Does ERP only work best when it is delivered in a potent and constant way. or is it okay to do the same amount but in a more scattered way? I keep doubting that my therapist actually knows what she is doing for some reason. Even though intellectually I feel she makes sense and has the best qualifications for treating OCD out of all the therapists I've seen so far, I keep doubting and analyzing it.

OCD,"Hello, I'm going to describe you my situation. So, I think my OCD began a few years ago when I heard about HIV in elementary school. I only knew that it can be transmitted via semen or blood, which I got extreme obsessive thoughts about. I thought that if my semen touches my wound I'll get HIV (which makes no sense and I wonder how I even managed not to find that out at that time). I searched the web all the time about it. It went away somehow. Later, summer before the thoughts in the title, I saw that before bedtime I was constantly doing things in a compulsive way like : 1. brush teeth then smile 3 times at the mirror 2. check dog outside if he is asleep 3. drink water until you reach the number you count in your head etc. Then, when it was time to vaccinate my dog, I researched the web about rabies and vaccines. After that, I got extreme obsessive thoughts about it and I constantly checked my dog (Golden retriever). Then the fear went extreme and I was afraid to touch anything, if I did I had to wash the part of my body that touched it ( not so good if you have eczema). I overcame that by exposure therapy when I worked with a relative of mine (he thought it was a good idea if I worked with him) . After that, with the thoughts present, I left the house and after locking the door I turn my back and a bat flies right in front of me ( about 1,5m or 5 feet) and since I developed the sense to constantly feel that something spits or touches me, I ran inside the house to check. Went to the mirror and I saw something wet on my mustache ( I drank water before), and I got so scared, I screamed, cried, wanted to get vaccinated ( Rabies is transmitted via bite or lick, not by some animal spitting you). After that I always check behind me if something touched me or if there were bats on the street, I am afraid when somebody opens the front door that a bat would fly in and that I wont see it. I am afraid of animals, even my regularly vaccinated family dog. Any tips to overcome this?

OCD,"Hi all, I thought I would share an achievement. Since the approval of the Covid vaccine, I have had daily obsessions/intrusive thoughts that I would go into anaphylactic shock/die from receiving the vaccine- something far removed from reality (I've never even had an anaphylactic reaction to anything). Counter this with daily thoughts of dying from contracting Covid, I was between a rock and a hard place. Die from Covid or die from the vaccine? 

Yesterday, I had a Covid vaccine appointment. I decided to use the technique, ""radical acceptance"", used in DBT, up to my 4:15 appointment (a morning appointment to spend less time working myself up would have been preferable but I'll take what I can get), and it worked. I waited 30 minutes after the shot for observation and was able to not only not obsess during this time about anaphylactic symptoms, but not drive myself into panic. 

I wish I could tell myself my past self that the torture I was putting myself through was for nothing, but alas, that is part of the ongoing journey of dealing with OCD.

 1)I enjoy being close to him and his company and even feel slightly awkward near him although it could be because we're not the closest I have a feelings its cause im attracted  


2) In a way I find him very pretty and look at him a lot, but this cancels out because I literally look at anyone and find them gorgeous,even my mom and my brother. so I guess its just in my nature to think people are insanely good looking  


3) Ive grown more attraction to older men in the years as I grow in maturity??? And he has the same maturity as me as I view him as more of a sibling than dad and like arent people attracted to their mental age?  
4) I still view him and want to see him as a dad but oh god the awkwardness between us makes me avoid him 24/7 and I can only communicate to him by roasts  


5)In a way.....he is my type? like smart I mean - and bad at handling emotions uh, so I could see me compatible with him, which is a hugeeee problem because this is a sign Im attracted to someone.

Or what if a better but more expensive component gets on sale? Etc....

I admit I even thought of not ordering anything at all because avoiding it altogether was the easier choice.

OCD,"I used to have major (bacteria) contamination OCD, but it’s really simmered down in recent years, and I am now more or less fine with touching most things—well, except greasy things. In the past few months, I’ve gotten a new obsession/compulsion regarding greasy foods (yey).

As with most parts of my OCD, I struggle to know what is “normal” and what is my OCD exaggerating things. Like, it _is_ normal for people to wash their hands after eating popcorn and not touch their keyboard or phone while eating popcorn, right? But I also have a hard time eating things that aren’t really greasy, like apples and bread, and feel like I should wash my hands after eating bread because my hands feel greasy. If I make toast with butter, I have to make sure to wash my hands thoroughly until the greasy feeling is gone. I’m not making up that my hands are greasy—they *are*—but are normal people who don’t have this kind of OCD fine with having greasy hands?

My brother eats food while on his computer and doesn’t wash his hands. He’ll eat chips or toast and just keep using his computer. Whereas I have to wash my hands or at least wipe it on something if I even touch my hair because I have greasy hair. And I have greasy skin, so if I touch my face or body, my hands feel greasy. I think that greasiness is a real feeling and not something my mind makes up, but surely it’s not normal to have to wash your hands even if your hands are slightly greasy, right?

I am terrified of having greasy hands and spreading that to my belongings. I have to wipe my phone with a wet microfiber cloth every time I wake up because it gets greasy from having it next to me in bed, and I usually shower after waking up because I feel so greasy. I think my greasy body and hair is a combination of stress/anxiety and not getting enough nutrition, as I haven’t been eating right due to depression, but I also have to wash my hands after touching things I perceive to be greasy, like my stove—or after I’ve made dinner or have eaten dinner.

OCD,"Hey everybody,

My girlfriend has OCD and went through some pretty intense treatment a couple years back, and now she's doing great! 

I don't have OCD myself so my explanation might not be great, but from what she explained to me, she has the type where she'll have these very intrusive thoughts that scare her.

For example, even though she's heterosexual, she'll walk past another girl and think about how pretty/attractive that girl is while she's with me, and feel confused about having that thought and also guilty because she's afraid she's wasting her/my time. To combat this, I'm pretty sure she did exposure therapy, where instead of fighting that thought, she'd instead welcome it and be like ""yeah, maybe I'm gay, so what?"" which normalized it in her head and made it less frightening.

It's done wonders for her, but now we're in a dilemma. We believe we may have uncovered some trust issues that lead back to her parents who were flaky and emotionally distant. This is great, but we don't know what kind of therapist to talk to in order to address these issues. 

The reason why is because if she goes to the same type of exposure therapist, she's afraid they might tell her that it's just another frightening ocd thought she has to normalize. On the other hand, if she just goes to a normal therapist, they might not be able to understand as easily how ocd may play a factor, and not really be able to help her.

OCD,"I’m already triggered from HOCD now I’m triggered from harm OCD. So here’s the most of it. I sexted a girl last night. It was going good and at the end of the night I asked her if I did anything wrong or if I made her upset. She said no and that she was happy. Flash forward to today. She says she wants to stop talking to me because to her something doesn’t feel right from yesterday. She says it’s not my fault and that I’ve been really kind and supportive of her, and that it’s all her and not me. I feel like she’s lying to me and that I did something to her or something like that. Great. I now have HOCD, POCD, and harm OCD to boot. I’m already triggered from POCD as it is. I remember watching a movie called Moonrise Kingdom by Wes Anderson when I was 16. The characters were 12. The movie explores child sexuality a lot. And there’s a scene where they are playing in the beach in their underwear and there’s a scene where they kiss. I remember feeling shit in my groin and getting panicked. To make matters worse I can’t remember whether or not I got a groinal response from it. Ffs. I DONT WANT TO BE A DISGUSTING PEDO OR MAP!!!! I ONLY WANT TO BE STRAIFHT AND LOVE WOMEN MY AGE!!!!!!!!!",I need advice right now
OCD,"Hi, so I’m a positive person. I pride myself in being a positive influence on those around me. I also have obsessive think that comes and goes. Anyway, two years ago i started to casually use an online chat site called ‘talk with stranger’. It was just something to go with porn, like talking to a stranger anonymously was just something I’d do sometimes. Of course most people on these sites are also men looking for a woman to have a quick sexual chat with. So id skip the men. It was an escape and I didn’t think of it as me as it was anonymous so I’d do it then wake up and have good times with family friends like that never happened, no big deal. 

Anyway I’ve been really happy lately and also barely ever used that site anymore, certainly not now. But the other day my OCD kicked in. My OCD thinking sometimes makes me think of the world as concrete black and white and statistically. And now I feel so dirty and ashamed because I value myself in my positive interactions but my brain won’t let me stop thinking that I only meet a certain amount of people I do good for and that may be statistically low compared to the ‘M or F? m *skip*’ interactions on that site. 


So I feel like yeah I may be friendly to someone on the street, and friends and family and people I meet but then I also had a so many interactions where it was ‘m or f? M *skip*’ (it’s easy to just skip so u go through a lot of people)

OCD,Ive been texting this girl and i really like her but we started talking flirty like sexual and I told her i dont wanna take advantage of her but I feel like I dont mean it. I feel like im faking being a nice guy to get close to her and i don't deserve her. Idk if im faking or not i feel like a sociopath,Am i bad?
OCD,I’m so terrified that I actually want to hurt people/animals. I can’t be around my pets without getting images of hitting them or smacking them. The second I get these images my brain is like “Do you like that? You like that.” and I can’t tell if the image makes me feel good or not and it’s scaring me. I am completely avoiding my pets in fear that I hit them and like it. There are even thoughts that are like “Smack them to see if you like it” which terrify me. I’m so terrified. I would completely isolate myself from everyone and everything before I hurt anything. It doesn’t help that as a child (after a suicide attempt) I would get angry at my dog and spank him after he would attack my mother (he has aggression issues). I stopped doing that mannnnyyyy years ago. But I get thoughts that are like “Do I even feel bad? What If I don’t feel bad about that?” Im so terrified. I don’t want to be an abuser. I’m going back to therapy next week. The second I got these thoughts I contacted my therapist.,Afraid of hurting animals/people

Whenever a big life event that I’m hopeful for is happening or going to happen I feel as though I can’t think about it or plan for it because if I do it won’t happen. Every time I have to think about I feel the need to knock on wood.

OCD,"i have been struggling with sexually themed thoughts for the last couple of months and they are very unwanted not the ones that you have control of, but recently i can’t tell which are mine and which aren’t. 

I try my best to just not think about anything of sexual nature because it makes me very very uncomfortable and I just do not enjoy the feelings of stuff like that. I find that even seeing or watching men makes me uncomfortable (i’m not asexual by the way) not only because if i find them attractive it can lead to terrible thoughts very quickly and overall just discomfort. 

I’m fairly young so maybe it’s just hormones and being angsty (i get very socially anxious) so maybe the thoughts are just a product of my discomfort and i end up just focusing on the bad things but i don’t know. I struggled with a porn addiction when i was really young (like 8-15) and so maybe it’s my discomfort with my past and the smallest things can trigger what i saw in those videos. Never went through any sexual trauma. 

Not sure why i’m like this but i just get really disgusted with myself, maybe this is just an ego thing i need to grow out of but i’m not sure. I don’t really know where else to post this but any advice or support would be awesome.

I was an avid watcher of porn unfortunately and I have stopped now and I just was clicking on random videos and then I came across this one video where I was thinking oh this girl looks young but it didn't occur to me that she could or is a child so I watched most of it whilst focusing on another adult woman but I just clicked off it later and I didn't even think much of it. Fast forward to now I see this guy going to jail for something like watching cp and im like that's gross I don't think I have done anything like that and then this memory pops up of that video and I'm like fuck what did I watch why did I do that. It obviously was a child looking back and I would never watch cp obviously and im definitely not a pedophile I just can't believe I did that and now I hate myself. I need to tell my therapist but idk if she will make me go to jail? idk if I did see similar videos or whatever my ocd is like what if u clicked on it again cause I can't remember but it's been torture I've been crying and I just want to end my life I won't because I'm a coward but I am a monster I think I am ace anyway I just really don't know what to do because nothing can change what I have seen I just want to be able to go wtf cp I haven't seen that but I have but I never wanted to I just did.

OCD,"-TRIGGER WARNING-

-TRIGGER WARNING-

-TRIGGER WARNING-

I don’t know if this is a huge trigger for others but for me even the mention of this word can cause very long agonising cycles. I have a weird symptom where I can get stuck in a loop of constant yawning. The two reasons I believe that it is an OCD symptom is because it can be triggered by just the mention of breathing and because it is very dependant of things feeling “just right”. If I even have the thought of breathing my breath will automatically be switched to manual breathing which is absolutely torturous as it will continue for as long as I am thinking about it and OCD makes it very hard to forget. I will have to yawn about every ten seconds and often I will get “failed yawns” like a yawn that didn’t work and didn’t give me the satisfaction of an ordinary yawn. This gives me an indescribable but absolutely horrible feeling and it will make me need to yawn again straight after. I also get feelings all over my body that things need to be just right. As a random example I’ll touch me left leg, then adjust my arm position, move my right arm up and so on. This may be influenced by my Tourette’s syndrome. If I can’t do all of those things and make the feelings go away, the yawn will be unsuccessful. Just to emphasise the sensitivity of the trigger for this, I have been in the yawning/manual breathing loop the entire time I have been writing this.

I have lost countless hours of sleep over this and it can has gotten to the point where it is mental torture and I have given up on trying to sleep and just gotten up at 4 am and had a coffee and watch tv or go for a walk until the sun comes up.",HUGE TRIGGER WARNING
OCD,I watch a lot of true crime and I have since I was little because my mom would always watch it with me. I feel like I'm too desensitized and sometimes when I hear a fact about a true crime incident I'm almost fascinated instead of being disgusted? Is that bad? Am I desensitized because I grew up watching true crime or is there something wrong with me? Does anyone else have this problem?,Am I a bad person for enjoying true crime?
OCD,"i suffer from contamination ocd, have been since 2016, been to therapy, on meds, i was making improvements but i dont know what the fuck got into my dad but he rubs his dirty hands on my face and lips every fucking day i dont know what to do i wanna kill myself. im unemployed and poor, didnt graduate so i have 0 opportunity to move out. the only thing i can do to get away from this is becoming homeless , or k!lling myself . fuck my life",dont know what to do i wanna d!e
OCD,"So this is kind of similar to intrusive thoughts that I think some people with OCD struggle with. Like you think of a terrible thing you'd never do but then feel terrible for thinking it, then you obsess over it...

Anyway. I had a very weird thought earlier today. I noticed that in my mouthwash the cap had tiny little black specks, I thought that was weird and then the next day I thought. *""What if my landlords are trying to poison me?""* They have no ill will towards me, they are good and decent people, and trying to kill me by poison me using my mouthwash cap is a really inefficient way to do so.

So now I feel weird. I feel crazy for even entertaining the thought, and now my OCD won't let go of said thought lol. To be honest, I don't know if this counts as OCD, I've heard of Pure-O (where it's just the obsession portion, minus the compulsion part, but I guess thinking about it and going on Reddit could be a compulsion? idk). Nonetheless, I do have OCD, some fairly bad anxiety, and depression.

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this and just get my mind off of this?

I am in therapy and will be seeing my doctor on Monday about the possibility of getting on some anti-anxiety meds and maybe something targeted at the OCD.

I don't think I'm crazy but I feel like it some days... lol. Any advice is appreciated, thank you.",Do you guys ever find yourself latching onto a seemingly crazy thought and then thinking you yourself could be crazy?
OCD,"Okay. Phew. This is a long one and it’s my first time on here. This is my story. As to whether this all truly is all OCD or not I honestly do not know and all I want is to just get better cause I’m sick of waking up everyday not able to be able to feel like I’m living. When I was a kid, I always did weird shit. I don’t mean that in a totally negative way or anything. My thinking was really just black and white, basic, I liked everything in a system. I liked everything to be seen through and experienced perfectly. If I read a book, played a video game, or watched a movie, I had to make sure I was viewing it right. I had to be in the right mindset, I had to hear and understand each word. I had to do everything 100 percent in a game. It was just the way I did things. I never noticed any anxiety with it but it got worse when I would inevitably fail. It escalated to having this thing where I would wanna restart my life perfectly and do everything right. I wanted to be the absolute best I could be. I got bad in middle school. I got obsessed with the concept of morality. Like I couldn’t think or do anything. I couldn’t eat chicken or meat without obsessing over is it right to eat animals? Are we good people? Etc. it got worse and worse. Everyday almost I kept resetting and resetting. I had this mental ritual where everyday at exactly 6:00 pm I would try to perfectly restart my life and delete all my social media, video game files, and try to do it all over again just perfectly and to where it felt just “right” and epic. This was my life All throughout elementary and middle school. It sucked. I never got to truly get that perfect start and because of that I never got to just live in those moments and feel as though I was living. It wasn’t all bad however. There was so many amazing things and the friends I had I’ll never forget. When high school came, I began to try and get it together. I learned briefly what ocd was and by then I had already come to terms in my head that okay I’m just really different. I wasn’t anxious about it. I was a little worried yeah but when I heard what it was I told my friend and he said yeah that sounds like ocd. This is where the story is going to go for a full 180 so bear with me. In 2016 I was in high school and I was in this really manipulative relationship. I was honestly really messed up obsessing whether or not I could trust her when I learned and saw she had lied and used to me and had a big time victim personality. I’ll spare the details but one night I felt so terrible that the next day I woke up and I couldn’t feel anything. Not happy or sad or anything and I started obsessing about it. I couldn’t tell whether I was making myself think I was or not. I definitely “felt” like I was. But after that for a full year it was an utter and absolutely terrifying life for me. My obsessions got terrifying. I was having intrusive thoughts that I was a danger to people, that I was gonna snap and at any moment I could harm or hurt someone, I had intrusive sexual thoughts of the people that I loved and cared about, I was scared I was gay( my attraction for girls was super strong all throughout middle and high school until that incident and I never felt attracted to anyone. Just nothingness. I had nothing at all against being gay. I just did not want to lose how much I loved girls. It just wasn’t me or what I identify as as heterosexual.) My junior year I got put on Prozac and in 3 months of summer I felt so much better. The thoughts left. I wasn’t 100 percent cured but it was easier. I later was taken off of it and for a year or so I was fine. Flash forward to 6 months ago. It’s gotten so much worse. First all the terrifying intrusive thoughts from then returned and it was really hard but I pulled through. Now is here where I’m at now and this is where I have no idea how to move forward. My obsession with perfect starts and just living my life to the best of my ability is eating me alive. All I want to do is always make the right choice but I dont know if this is all me. Am I truly trying to be a good person or is it just cause my ocd is forcing me to? Am I going to be the same person after treatment? I really really hope I aim to do great things and be selfless and help others. I really do. Lately I had a massive anxiety spike a few days ago. I was playing the original donkey Kong on switch. A super very BASIC GAME right? I couldn’t do it. I have this thing where in my mind I can’t get the full experience out of a game unless I play the absolute first game in the series that came first with that feeling of “okay I did this perfect the way it should be”, I also have to know everything about its development cycle and I need to 100 percent the game. Donkey Kong is a super simple game but in my head I said okay I need to jump over 5 barrels on this first floor then 5 on the second then 5 on the third and I have to get all the items and I have to play it like I’m really in the game and it’s real life and I have to make the right choice and - you see why I’m really really freaking out right? You’re probably reading this and thinking Jesus this kid needs some serious help. I’ve “always” been like this and I’m sick of it. I want to stop being obsessed with starting on perfect days. January 1st. In my head last year I said okay 1/1/2021 sound so perfect and feels right to start fresh. When I was in middle school I was set in my head that I had to learn everything. I would obsessively read and restart taking notes in textbooks from school if I didn’t feel I was learning and taking in everything “right”. Honestly, as I’m writing this, I feel kinda anxious in my chest. It’s like my anxiety is throwing up all over this electronic keypad. Neat huh? Basically I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I don’t know why I’m like this. I just deeply deeply inside just want to be a good man with a good heart, not make the same mistakes as my parents, and go after my dreams and have friends and family behind my back but I can’t do any of that because I can’t tell what or who I am or want cause it’s all just obsessively doing things in a order and having that feeling of “perfect”.

OCD,"Hi everyone, I recently was diagnosed with an obsessional form of OCD by a therapist when I finally started sharing intrusive thoughts I've had for years. At first I felt relieved, but now I'm worried that maybe I don't have OCD after all. I've been reading a book she gave me and my obsessions just don't line up with the ones the book talks about. I also have noticed that I tend to have several different obsessions at once, like sometimes I worry about being a horrible person deep down for a few days, and then for the next few days I'll obsess about something different. Sometimes I have an intrusive thought and then feel the need to research that thought or find an answer to it and feel emotionally consumed by it, but within hours the thought has disappeared and/or no longer bothers me. Many of my obsessions have had the same general theme for years, but I'm worried that I might not actually have OCD because I have not read about people who have intrusive thoughts that are intense and scary for a few hours and then go away. Has anyone else had this? Thank you so much.",Could this actually be OCD?
OCD,"I've been weighing the idea of going on medications for OCD for a little while. I really wasn't looking forward to going on SSRIs and dealing with side effects, and being dependent on a medication that causes withdrawals when I go off of it. On the other hand, I was still having a difficult time functioning even after ERP. My biggest intrusive thoughts were mostly gone but I still had other annoying symptoms.

 So I decided to try NAC after reading a few small studies that say it helps. It is a supplement that affects glutamate in the brain and can be bought over the counter. I found no difference at the recommended dose (2400mg a day) so I upped it to 3600 and my mind is very quiet. The intrusive thoughts are less frequent, the background chatter is mostly gone, and the constant rush of uncontrollable thoughts is just silent, as is the creeping sense of dread. I don't fall into ruminations, which used to last 4-6 hours a day at my worst. OCD had infiltrated every corner of my life, but now it's just.... quiet?

The only issue I have with NAC is that it doesn't last very long, so I've been taking them at 7am, 12pm and 5pm. Anyone else have experience with it?",NAC for OCD is working

I don’t feel like I had to post this out of any immediate fear or anxiety, I voluntarily came here without any anxiety, and that’s what’s confusing me.

Is this just my OCD? I feel like a terrible person even tho that’s not me,My OCD is trying to convince me I’m a terrible person. Do I subconsciously want this?
OCD,"Hey, I’d like to start off by saying that my libido is EXTREMELY high and I watch a f*ck ton of porn to the point where I can safely assume that I’m a full blown addict 😐

I’ve had a few sexual obsessions growing up but this one’s been bothering me on a whole different level. Therapist says it’s OCD but all I do is doubt, doubt, doubt. A few weeks ago I’ve been at probably the lowest point of my life where I have seriously considered suicide with the blade on my wrist and have gone way too far with this self harm shit. My OCD revolves around pedophilia... 

Now just to make this clear, as horny as I am, I only fantasise about women and girls my age which I do naturally, not because I choose to in order to prove anything to myself. I am 101% certain of my attraction to adult females because only I know how thirsty I can get at times lol. I have never fantasised about or had the slightest urge to do anything with a child. Even when I watch pornography and get intrusive thoughts I can feel myself getting turned off which eventually leads to, well... a bad orgasm. I find myself jerking off way too often lately because I can’t feel satisfied unless I get it right. I mean it literally hurts at this point. 

This is what’s constantly worrying me though: there are moments (rarely but still happens) when the thought pops up into my head and I feel like a tingling sensation. I have never managed to get the slightest erection from the thought but something tells me that I would be able to if I tried hard enough, which scares the sh*t out of me. I’ve said this to my therapist and she told me about conditioning and how because I’ve been having these thoughts while orgasming could lead to some sort of sexual reaction, which doesn’t mean I like the thought but what it reminds me of. Which is porn. This did bring some relief but I still can’t be sure of anything unfortunately. 

My worry isn’t about being an exclusive pedophile but the idea of there being even a very slight attraction makes me want to kill myself to be quite honest... now I’ve read a reply from a real pedophile saying that the reason POCD is a thing is because people don’t know what pedophilia is, and that a pedophile would always pick children over adults. But does that really have to be a rule? Why can’t it be the other way around? At the end of the day I’m assuming it’s a spectrum. Another thing is, if it was to be real surely I would’ve figured it out sooner, right? 

Anyway, I’ve been ranting a bit too much but I’m basically asking for reassurance which I know I shouldn’t be doing but oh well... lately I’ve been managing to deal with my anxiety by simply trying to ignore the thought, avoiding anything to do with children, repeating stuff to myself and all of that which surprisingly seems to work quite well, even though recently I realised that being anywhere near a child gives me extreme anxiety. 

Some info about myself:
I’m 16/male, obsession started around last year and lasted for about a week (nowhere near as intense as it’s been for these past 2 months) then kinda went dormant. Lately I’ve been a bit better by not exposing myself to the thought as much but I used to be getting very intense panic attacks, breakdowns and anxiety. I feel like I’m kind of breaking the rules by seeking reassurance right now but I really need an answer. Thank you.",SOCD / reassurance - please help
OCD,"I was wondering if people with Ocd have less dopamine and therefore need it to feel good. Or is it the other way around? Reading discussions online about dopamine detox made me wonder about this. Where yes, maybe it is something that logically can work on healthy people, maybe just stressed. But those of us with this disorder, who are stressed because of intrusive thoughts, etc... 24/7, shouldn't it be the opposite conversation? 

&amp;#x200B;

I remember some time ago I read a similar thing about serotonin where we chemically because of the disorder have the receptors high. Logically, if serotonin is missing, dopamine is also missing or plays an important role, right?

I still feel the impulse to do certain things (count everything 5 times for example) but.. it doesn't rule my entire life. I can forget about it. This is life changing.

One thing I didn't expect, is it makes me forget about picking my nails and skin. I've often had the thought that ""I will literally never reach a point in my life where I can stop picking my skin"" or something to that effect. I still kind of do it. I'm still fixated around my nails a little bit, except now it's growing them out instead of picking them. Also, still kind of messing them up in some ways that isn't picking. (Kind of hard to explain without a visual) There's one thing I used to do with my skin but it's too gross to mention. While I'm still preoccupied on it a little bit, I often completely forget about it.  I didn't even think this was possible.

I am ''obsessed'' I guess with making sure there is not too much good happening and if there is, purposely sabotaging myself in various ways to make sure it offsets the good. I have avoided getting a new job and staying with my current dead end one because right after starting it, my brother died. I got myself a dog and my other brother died. I started going to college, my grand father died.  I have purposely avoided new opportunities, extras and good fortune to make sure my life stays average at best.

OCD,"I have a phobia that my phone causes cancer, and because radio waves emit outwardly it’ll harm other people. I thought I had it under control, I had it under control for months, but a new study has come out finding that phones cause cancer and I’m going down a spiral.

The fear is that if I use a phone, I’d give someone else cancer. I’d accept the risk if it only harmed me, but unfortunately if phones cause cancer then the risk would still be present to everyone around me. I’m sick to death, I went through months of not using a phone,
TV, computer, Laptop, WiFi and it shattered my life into pieces. The amount of friends I lost, the news I missed, the catch up with my family, it fucking destroyed me. I went through therapy, but it didn’t really work. They tried exposure therapy (via phone because of COVID) but all throughout that time I was researching about phones causing cancer, and it simply didn’t stop my compulsions, they stayed for months after therapy. I don’t know what to do, if I stop using technology then the next 5 years are going to be constant pain, and it’ll destroy any hope and joy in me, but if it’s starting to look like phones cause cancer I can’t just use a phone around people knowing it’ll hurt them.","I’m really struggling, I’m sick to death."
OCD,"Just venting because I’m very frustrated that I have to think like this...

I’ve had contamination ocd for a bit now, but it’s usually related to my hands and needing to wash them a lot. 

However recently it’s turned into fears about my face masks being contaminated. It started with something somewhat more reasonable, I used to always pull my mask down when I got in my car so that it was resting over my neck. One day I thought, “what if there’s Covid on your neck, and now you’re going to get it in your mask and breathe it in when you put it back on.” 

Scary thought, so I got back and left my mask out for a few days since Covid dies on surfaces after around that period of time. I use reusable cloth masks and have three of them. 

So, I have two others that I can use. Except now my contamination fears start to get absurd. I generally have contamination fears relating to viruses, molds, and toxic chemicals. 

So now that my fears have spread beyond my hands, it’s making things more difficult. For instance, after using chemicals to clean my bathroom, I wash my hands. But sometimes my brain tells me that not all the chemicals are off. I itch my face a lot at home, so after itching it, I get thoughts like what if it’s now contaminated my face, and then when I put my mask on, the mask will then be contaminated with chemicals which I will then breathe in constantly. 

I know. It’s absurd. But it’s frustrating because I get immense panic before I put my mask on to leave now. When it first started it got so bad that I just didn’t leave my house until I washed them all throughly. 

It’s just frustrating. I have a pack of throwaway surgical masks that I could use and do sometimes, but they don’t fit as well as my cotton masks so I don’t really like using them in public. 

I’m trying to fight this obsession though. I keep getting the urge to throw my masks in the washing machine after any trigger but I know that constantly doing it will wear down the masks and make them less effective in general...

I wish I could go back to when I didn’t have these contamination fears lol. For like the first 8 months of using these I would leave my mask on the floor, throw them anywhere in my car, and would go weeks without washing them. I know, gross. It’s just strange how much my mindset about it changed. But for the worse.",New contamination fears related to my face masks

Anyways sometimes I will tell myself I have to forgive myself because I was only nine years old and at the time I was getting abused myself. I also tell myself tht I’m not a bad person because I understand what I did was wrong and even in tht moment in my nine year old  brain I still decided to stop what I was doing cuz I realized it was wrong. But sometimes I feel like I’m a monster, and this is where I think it’s ocd, I feel like every new person I meet or any friends I hang out with or anyone who thinks I’m a good person needs to know what I did when I was nine because if not then in my head I’m lying to them. Like even if it’s someone who just glances at me I feel like they need to know what I did when I was 9. Like I obsess over something that happened years ago.

Researchers at Johns Hopkins are conducting a brief online survey about the effects of psilocybin in people who have used a moderate to high dose of psilocybin mushrooms (also called “magic mushrooms”) while taking an antidepressant medication, or within two years of stopping such treatment. Psilocybin is a compound that occurs naturally in certain species of mushrooms, and is currently being studied for its possible antidepressant effects. However, people who are currently using or have recently used antidepressants may react differently to psilocybin, and this interaction is not well understood. Your participation in this research study can help improve our understanding of how psilocybin works in people who have used antidepressant medications.

OCD,"trigger warning: racism, intrusive racist thoughts

Hello all,

I've been having lots of thoughts about racism lately. I am still not sure if these are intrusive thoughts or not, but I want to be sure what the distinction between intrusive thoughts and actual racism are.

I was talking to a friend of mine about dating, and they told me something that was racist. They told me that they had a ""racial preference"" in dating and that they did not want to date black people. They told me that they felt uncomfortable around black people, and that they felt that black people usually talked in an aggressive manner that made them uncomfortable.

I felt a little bit put on the spot, but I tried to politely tell them what was wrong with their beliefs. I told them this ""preference"" was not the same thing as a sexual preference to a specific gender, and was instead affected by culture. I told them that not all black people talked in the ""aggressive"" way my friend said they talked like. I told them that dating black people is not intimidating in the way my friend was making it out to be, and that they should not avoid dating black people, because they may be missing out on an opportunity to meet someone that's perfect for them.  

It just scares me because I notice that I have acted uncomfortable around black people before, and it makes me think that I am not much different from my friend. I remember having a period of time where I was not extremely fixated on racist thoughts and a fear of acting racist. Of course I still had racist/sexist/homophobic/etc. thoughts and stereotypes in my head, but there was not the fear that came with the thoughts. I could avoid fixating on them like everyone else can.

Before I was super fixated on these thoughts, I could have a normal conversation with a black person without thinking about it. Once the thoughts gradually took over me, a conversation with a black person would make my face go red, I would think about how uncomfortable my stance, my facial expressions were, even looking at my expressions after conversations in a mirror to see if I was acting uncomfortable and racist. When I was walking down a hallway and saw a black person, I would think about all the ways my body could be acting to be uncomfortable and racist, which would make me feel uncomfortable, which is racist. I even struggled with not feeling extreme stress when looking at an image of a black person, because I would tell myself that I was perceiving them in a racist way, even if I did not think of any racist stereotypes.

What I've been trying to do to address this problematic behavior of mine is to start talking to black people when I am out in public.  I also noticed that breathing exercises from my Cognitive Behavioral Therapy that are aimed at my ADHD and Anxiety are weirdly helpful during stressful moments!

With one step at a time, I seem to be improving my behavior. When I first talked to black people while out in public, I would get so nervous that my face would go red, but over time I stopped having this problem. On my less anxious days and I am walking by a black person down the hallway, I can let go of my thoughts that are telling me how uncomfortable I must be acting around black people, and just walk down a hallway like a normal person! I do not feel extreme stress anymore when looking at a picture of a black person. 

Perhaps the difference between my friend and I is that I see acting uncomfortable around black people as a racist act that needs to be fixed and my friend does not? I try to talk to black people, and tell my therapist about my problem so that my therapist can help me to stop acting uncomfortable around black people, while my friend just tells themself that they are perfectly fine acting uncomfortable around black people, that this is a ""race-based preference"", and that this is ""what black people deserve"" for acting stereotypically black. But my guess is that my friend doesn't experience the same amount of anxiety with their ""discomfort"" as I do, and that they just see a black person, think of stereotypes about them, and never question those stereotypes.

What also scares me is that I notice that I sometimes have the thought ""I don't want to date a black person"" and then an stereotyped image of a black person in my head and how it would be ""so awful"" to date that stereotyped image. To respond to this thought, I would tell myself that I have seen racist stereotypes all my life, but that these thoughts are not reflective of what I believe. I have had crushes on black people and dated a black person before, so I know that I do not actually hate dating black people or am ""incapable"" of falling in love with a black person. I would also tell myself that not every black person fits the stereotypes of black people, and it is toxic to assume a person is a certain way because they are black. Black people face the emotional burden of those stereotypes, and black people are usually forced to go out of their way to avoid being perceived as that stereotype. So I now know that this thought is racist but not me, so I should just move on from the thought.

In other words, as a result of living in a racist society, it is normal for white people to have these racist thoughts and stereotypes in their heads. What matters is the *second* thought that comes after it: do I genuinely believe that this racist thought is true or do I correct myself for thinking of a racist stereotype? At the same time, I should not tell myself that I am a terrible person because I am having the thought, since then I will pressure myself not to think of the thought and then I will think of the thought even more.

Is this the appropriate way to approach these thoughts? I've been acting off-kilter for the past few years due to thoughts that are racist/homophobic/ableist/etc., and I've noticed that the intrusive thought approach towards my negative thoughts helps me to think of them less and get less anxiety over them. I just want to be sure that I am approaching this in the right direction and not acting the same way as my friend did.",Intrusive Racist Thoughts and Racism?

OCD,"So I have mindfucked myself through a stupid decision I made last Saturday. 

After going on a walk in the afternoon and spending an hour trying to dodge dog shit whilst pushing the baby’s pram I noticed that I had a suspicious foreign entity on the the bottom of my shoe when I got home. Anyway it looked like dog shit.....not loads but enough.....so I scraped most of it off using a small block of wood laying about and sorta tossed it behind the shed, not properly so I kicked it further behind so my in my mind (later on that day) there is/was some loose dog poo in that area .

I made the stupid decision,  without thinking,to rub the remainder off on the grass in my garden. It was quite stubborn so it required a lot of foot wiping and I ended up rubbing through a large area of grass.....at the time I didn’t think it through.

Meltdown 1 - I stepped into my house, having already took my shoes off and by avoiding stepping on the back door mat I sorta lost my balance slightly....with my shoes in my hand and I became convinced that my shoe that I had just been rubbing furiously (side of the tread) touched me on my leg or belt or jacket/shirt and this triggered  my first OCD meltdown, I wasn’t certain if I did touch myself with the shoes and this in itself was driving me crazy. so I got undressed and completely froze as I didn’t know how to react or feel, especially about my belt....it’s not machine washable and was a gift from my partner for Christmas. I literally stood at the top of the stairs pretty much stripped and holding this belt down I couldn’t move. I felt stupid for needing and wanting to shower over it all yet I really wanted to cleanse myself. I told my partner what was going on and she thought I was being OTT....I probably was but my brain was melting down over it. She tried to convince me to just wash my hands but in the end I put the belt down the side of the wardrobe (it’s still there) and I jumped on the shower where I spent over an hour cleaning.

Meltdown 2 - Come Saturday night after my meltdown shower....... and it dawned on me.....we have 2 cats and all I could think about was the cats trodding through the areas where I rubbed my shoe ......1 of the areas is a definite where 1 of the cats passes through regularly to his sleeping spot...... now all I can think about is this dog shot being spread all around the house and it was too late, the cats have already been in and out a lot and I think it is everywhere...floor, carpets, their beds, back of the couch, window sills etc and because I think they have bought in....I am thinking me and my partner are spreading it further through walking through it and around the house....ITS EVERYWHERE!!! it was late and I couldn’t deal with it so I went to bed.

Meltdown 3 - Sunday morning, first thing I do in the morning is go into the garden and hose down the areas that are contaminated with dog poo....but first things first.....the hose nozzle has split from the recent frosty weather so it was not at full spraying strength....but I carried on and drenched the fuck out all the areas I could remember wiping my foot (I forgot about the piece of wood I used for scraping annoyingly) hoping that would at least stop the contamination further in my mind....I was at it for about 20-30 minutes.....and as soon as stopped I noticed my lower part of my pants where covered in splashes.......OMG IM COVERED IN DOG POO IM CONTAMINATED AGAIN!!. So again  I stripped off and off I popped into the shower for another hour or so.

The garden clean didn’t work as sometime between the garden soak and Monday morning one of the cats had walked their ultra muddy wet paws along the floor and onto the back on the couch......I was almost crying as I was convinced it was full of dog poo remnants soacked into the floor and couch and once again I just keep thinking it’s being spread everywhere through walking around the house by us and the cats.

And since then all I have done is clean the floors over and over, the couch has been scrubbed to death and the cats keep walking in and out everywhere here and there and I’m just going out of my mind.

My partner’s brain is still working correctly and is relaxed about it like any normal person, it doesn’t bother her at all as she doesn’t think any of what I think is happening.

I’ve been using antimicrobial wipes on everything over and over, on different days, my hands are wrecked from the cleaning and washing. I bought 10litres of cleaning vinegar for the garden and poured that the best I could over the areas which were contaminated (I ordered a big spray bottle but It came a day late). My partner is stressed to fuck with me as I’m cleaning so much and I’m not available to help with baby duties. My work has suffered as I can’t concentrate or I’m in the shower when I should be at my PC.

I’ve had at least 2 further meltdowns over cleaning certain things as I get confused over what has touched what and where etc....

I’ve always had a few OCD tendencies which came out in a massive a massive flare up about 12 years ago (where the squeaking of fruit packaging made a horrible squeak sound that cut right through me which turned into a sound and touching stuff problem for about 6 months, I couldn’t walk on grass, touch toilet paper, lots of,other things without getting that chalkboard scratching shudder feeling) it took me about 6 months for that to calm down.

I’ve always been a little bit OTT with hygiene related cleaning but it was always manageable before COVID-19 and having a baby so I think those have amplified my cleaning tendencies. I have been washing the delivered food shopping and quarantining post for a year now and it has become completely normalised as well as washing my hands about 4 times for everything I touch that may have coronavirus on it from outside the house.

As it stands right now I’m planning on cutting the grass in the morning, flooding the garden with a new hose and keeping the cats out all day while I clean the inside of the house as much as I can. I have 10 more litres of cleaning vinegar which I may or may not use (not decided). I feel like I am fighting a losing battle of stopping the contamination.

So I think I am suffering from contamination and association OCD. Everything about my garden feels wrong and I’m worried I will always view it that way.",7 day OCD meltdown (so far)

OCD,"I just joined the sub a few weeks ago and finally mustered up the courage to say hello! Happy to be amongst a group of legends willing to admit to their struggles with OCD. The encouragement from everyone is heartwarming to read. Together we can seek solace in knowing we aren’t alone. 

I was diagnosed my freshman year of college (I’m 28 now). Had to move back home to seek some help and live in a more comfortable environment. I’m still not where I’d like to be mentally, but I’ve shown improvement. The bad days don’t heavily outweigh the good ones anymore.

Recently, I’ve begun meditation, and I’ve noticed a difference! I had a weekend about 2 weeks ago where my headspace was totally free - I was shocked. It’s the first time in a long time where I felt present. I didn’t have any ridiculous thoughts constantly passing through my mind and was able to just genuinely enjoy the day. It was fucking awesome and I wish that feeling for all of you. 

Anyways, happy to be here!",New Member! Hey!
OCD,"Ugh, I feel like my ocd is making a shift.  I have dealt with ups and downs in my relationship before and had a major down about 3 years ago.  Well those obsessions have returned again and knocked me off my life orbit.  For the last 18 months my ocd has focused on fears of harm but now it is back to guilt over fears that I emotionally cheated a few years ago or if I didn’t do that directly I was too eager to thinking about that.",Shift in my Obsessions
OCD,"So I'm going to a get together at a friend's house with some other friends. This morning I had an apple with peanut butter for breakfast, but then I remembered that I'm going to be hanging out with a friend who has a severe peanut allergy... and I managed to get some peanut butter on myself. I've changed my pants once, and my sweater twice, but I'm still scared to go to the party because I feel like the Typhoid Mary of peanut butter right now...",Peanut Allergies
OCD,"Look at my previous posts for context. My anxiety went down after 11 days and asking every single person on the zoom call (they must think I’m a mess but they were all really nice). 

I tell my mind that if I did say a whole offensive rant (for no reason) what did I say? That calms me down bc throughout this whole anxiety week I have yet to actually even pinpoint what I even could of said.

However now I constantly have to think of all the reasons it didn’t happen and say that I have no reasons/proof that it did. Multiple times per day I go through that list. I want to get back to my regular self. Usually I only worry about things for 4days max but this shows no sign of retreating.",How to stop or limit ruminating thoughts.
OCD,"Since I was about 8 years old, I would always count everything to 4 and when I touched something accidentally 2 times, then I would have to touch it 2 more times so it adds to 4.. I know it sounds a bit crazy or weird but idk it’s just normal for me. It’s always very satisfying to me, when it’s either 4 or 16 (16 because 4x4). Idk i guess my brain is like obsessed with this number??????

I’m 16 now, and it has never been so severe, I’m not sure if it’s because lately I’ve had a lot of stress because of school and friends. Especially my grades, since I’m on the edge of repeating the year. During exams it’s very hard to focus sometimes because I’m just touching my pen the whole time counting to 4. 
It’s honestly quite exhausting because when I go hangout with my friends or have to be someplace, I also do last minute counting or have to place objects neatly there and make sure everything looks about right so that I can go, which leads to me often being late :/

(((((((( If you have something similar please share your story in the comments as it would interest me a lot!! I would love to know your experiences ))))))

Here are a few other examples of my daily counting,

- When I touch the door handle I count to 4 in my head, and I always have to press it down 4 times too (this is basically with any item but the I’m naming the most common ones)

- If I blink to fast 2 times I need to blink with the same speed 2 times again so it adds up to 16

- Before I mentioned the number 16, that is because if I accidentally touch something for than 4 times I need to count more until its 16 so that’s  its ok

- When my mom takes the car at night to go pick up my sister from a friends house, all of a sudden I am forced by myself to touch everything way more than usual because I then have this feeling if I don’t touch everything exactly the correct way mom will get into a car accident or something bad will happen

- I’m half French meaning fluent in it as well, and for some reason I always have to count in French when my “ocd” hits, its like a made up rule that has just always been there

- When I type on my laptop accidentally 2 times the same letter after another i also do it 2 more times so it adds up to 4 and the continue writing, so when I write essays it takes a lot longer

But it’s really just anything I touch, it needs to be 4 times said in my head in French. 

Anyways, there are so many of these that happen daily and I honestly I don’t know anyone else who can relate to me, they all say its so ‘weird’ and no one understands.. If someone has something similar please share your story I’m so interested to hear and to relate. If you want you can also message me privately about it that makes you feel more comfortable :) 

Thank you for listening to this and hopefully understand, please share your thoughts or stories if you have anything to say, thank you all again!

OCD,"Hey folks. Looking for what it is called when your OCD has convinced you that there's some sort of eventual catastrophe that is coming for you. In short, I'm pretty sure what I'm dealing with is a variant of false memory OCD.

When the symptoms are spiking, I've got this sense that I can't enjoy life since it's all about to be destroyed because of one of these things. For example, I've been convincing myself that I cheated on a major exam for my profession (which didn't happen, I have people who took the exam with me who said I didn't).

My OCD is trying to convince me that should that be ""found out"" my life will be ruined. What is this called? Does anyone else experience it? Essentially my brain is playing out the consequences of my obsession being true, and being found out, and it's difficult to enjoy life with the fear that it's going to be ruined. Finding a name for the symptom will help me deal with it, because I can actually talk to someone about it.",Feeling of remote impending doom. What is that called?
OCD,"I kept pulling all nighters last week and when I did sleep it was for 2-4 hours, really unhealthy and I’d always end up falling asleep in class and missing a lot of important stuff. I don’t use a hairdryer to dry my hair and that week I was washing my hair about every day and not drying it properly afterwards, I have about shoulder length hair and it’s fairly dense so it doesn’t dry properly even when I want it to. And I’d just go to bed after taking a shower and I came to find that there was mold on there two days ago, this happened before a couple weeks ago, but because I kept putting wet clothes on my bed. My mattress had like a 25 year long warranty and a year long return policy so everything was alright but I wasted a lot of time going to the furniture shop and driving back, my dad was surprisingly okay with it, he just told me to make sure it doesn’t happen again and now that it has idk what to do I feel guilty but I can’t live with mold on my bed it’s too upsetting. Even before my ocd became this bad, I always drew the line at mold. My therapist reassured me the last time this happened that mold can’t hurt me, I don’t have an autoimmune disease and I’ll be fine but it’s not easy to accept.

OCD,"Today, as the title reads, I broke up with my girlfriend of nine months. As of typing this, two hours ago I broke up with her. She was my first actual love and person who I’ve felt connected to and genuinely cared and we broke up two hours ago.
It’s a bit surreal, all month I’ve been having my normal obsessive thoughts but they mainly focused on us splitting up. I tried my best to shut them down, reaffirm myself, and talk to her/someone about it to limit it and it worked most of the time. And then three weeks ago or so, we got into an argument. Mainly started by me. About how I felt like the relationship was extremely one-sided. It seemed to be me doing everything in my power to maintain it and fix things. And if by the chance I was bothered or upset by anything, I would bring it up to her, and she would respond with the usual, “thank you for talking to me, i’m sorry, i will try harder next time,” simple reparations that very often did not lead to solutions by her and led to me fixing her own problems. Needless to say, it had been boiling up for a month or so before this argument so although it felt good for me to release it, it was a lot for her to digest. This time, she did recognize her wrong. And she specifically said would she would do to fix it. And for once after an argument, I had a positive outlook on the relationship’s future. It looked promising. 
Today comes around like a normal day, wake up, text her I love her, continue on with the day, texting her occasionally to update her on what I’m doing or to check in. But, this past week has been dreadful. I’ve been drowning in school work, stressed by my family, and been trying to repress the most prominent and striking obsessive thoughts I’d ever had, us breaking up. This entire week it was a pain throbbing in my brain, nonstop. And every time I would tell myself to calm down, to reevaluate what I’m thinking and observing, to talk to her about them, they just got worst. Today, I told her for the second time this week that they’ve gotten worst. I’d told her specifically everything and she was supportive. She did what she could to help. It was nice. I went off to do something for school, came back two hours later, and we facetimed. It was a normal facetime, discussing our day, what we did, and how we’ve been feeling, until the idea of sex came up.
I brought up the fact that we haven’t had any romantic or sexual encounters within the past two months and whenever I would engage, I would get shot down or made fun of. It was a serious issue for me and she recognized it. I drove over to discuss it in person and as we talked, she recognized her wrong. Various different things, including wrong doings on my side and hers lead to it, but then she said those vital words, “thank you for talking to me, i’m sorry, i will try harder next time,” and something clicked for me. I decided to address it and said everything I felt. I told her how those words were just reparations and I always became the one to fix things. And things spiraled out from there. It became a whole observation of our entire relationship. Quickly, things got serious and eventually I remembered my obsessive thoughts. Suddenly, it all made sense. I brought up the idea that maybe these are just fundamental differences in what we need in a relationship. I said that we might have drifted off while maturing in what we need in a relationship. She was hesitant to recognize and acknowledge it, cause to her, it admitted defeat. It admitted we had to break up. But eventually, after talking it through, she agreed with me. After a thoughtful and meaningful discussion of reminiscing and jokes, we broke up with tears in our eyes and snots in our noses. It was nice, mutual, and what seems to be a good note, as of right now, which I hope will stay.
This story is strange because for so long, I thought my valid thoughts and emotions was my OCD acting up. I thought it was Obsessive Thoughts that were ruining my mental image of the relationship but, they turned out to be true. So many times my obsessive thoughts tend to be exaggerations, lies, or hurtful, but this time they were helpful. They were led by emotion and knowledge. And I would have continued to push off this break up from happening if I continued to devalue my emotions and thoughts.
Sure, your mental health plays a factor into your perception of your relationships and the world around you, but they are valid. Your emotions, thoughts, and your actions are all real and valid and you have no reason to hide any of them. Listen to them when you know to. Discuss with those around you them so it will be easier to tell if they’re hurtful or harmful.
This relationship was straining my livelihood. I was carrying it on my shoulders all by myself, like I’m sure so many of you have, and once, I decided to stand up to myself, and that’s because of my OCD.

tl;dr - OCD can exaggerate things but even if your OCD controls your thoughts, your knowledge and emotions are valid (or something like that idk)",Today I broke up with my girlfriend of nine months.
OCD,"This has been on my mind a lot lately, it's my most recent festering conundrum. My past is always haunting me, even when I'm fixating on something innocuous. And every time I convince myself that there couldn't possibly be someone else in the world that does/did what I did I eventually discover that I'm dead wrong, and it gives me a huge sense of relief to know I'm not alone. So I figured I'd come here because I see myself reflected in the users of this sub more than anywhere else on Reddit.

All through 1st through 4th grades I made these odd drawings where I'd cover a sheet of paper with a random swirling line, then color in the spaces the line creates. It's difficult to describe it clearly, so I made an example: https://imgur.com/a/D03FnEM. 

The only rule was to try and prevent neighboring spaces from having the same color. Outside of that, it was completely random. Color choice, picking a space, I didn't plan any of it. I just grabbed a marker, filled in a spot, rinse and repeat. 

I made hundreds of these things. Sometimes I'd make as many as 4 or 5 in a day. I've never met anyone else or heard of anyone making drawings like these.

I've never thought much about it but lately a bunch of largely unrelated events has been bringing up those old memories. I think it's because I've discovered in recent years that a lot of the early behavior I *thought* was normal or just a little weird was actually early signs and symptoms of serious mental illness. Because of that, I've been putting all my childhood quirks and habits under the microscope.

I tried looking up some childhood psychology resources, I've known for years that a child's artwork can be interpreted in a similar way to one's dreams. I just wanted to know what it means when a child draws completely pointless abstract images. After reading a bit about it, I only feel worse.

None of the guides on interpretation mentioned anything even remotely like what I used to make. OK, that could just mean it's uncommon. But then I dove into some articles that examine the purpose behind drawing. 

Psychologists used to think younger children that had little motor control drew scribble blobs simply because they enjoyed the feeling of pencil or crayon rubbing against paper, that it was a tactile practice, but they eventually realized that every time a child draws something, even just a line, they have some kind of corresponding story playing out in their head while they do it. For children, drawing is less about what ends up on the paper and more about what's going on in their mind in that moment. For a child, even something as simple as a single straight line means something. 

All children (except for those raised in situations that are so dire they don't have any writing tools) play around with both abstract and realistic art, it plays a big role in their development. In some ways, everything they draw is abstract, even when they're trying to realistically replicate an object.

But I wasn't like that. I almost never tried to draw real objects. The only time I did something like that was when a teacher instructed us to do so. Outside of that, whenever I was given the chance to draw whatever I wanted I either drew symbols (about 10% of the time; compass roses, peace signs, and ying yangs were my favorites) or the weird abstract things like what I showed you above.

But the thing that bothers me about it is there was no story in my head, there was no meaning behind it. Like I said earlier, even scribble blobs are supposed to be something, to mean something. It's common for children to start randomly drawing and figure out what it's supposed to be while it's in progress, but I never did that either. Even after I was done, I never saw anything in it. I never named them, either. 

Children also usually draw something with the intention of presenting or giving the end result to someone, like a parent, friend, or teacher. I never even showed any of my abstract art to anyone, let alone gave them to anyone. I tucked them away in my desk or dresser as soon as they were done, then eventually threw the whole stack away when it was time to clean everything out. I never felt any attachment toward them, they didn't seem like they were worth keeping. 

I'm just trying to figure out what this means and how it relates to my mental status. The more I know about how my mind works the better I become at trying to work around or with it to create a comfortable, healthy life. 

Based on what I've learned, I'm thinking they may have been a compulsion, that it was a precursor to my desire to make pointless yet complex bullet lists about the fictional worlds and characters I create during maladaptive daydreams. 

So, did any of you do anything similar to this when you were young?","Did any of you make a bunch of unusual, pointless abstract drawings when you were young?"
OCD,"Hi there! I am a third year undergraduate at University College London. I study medicine but am taking a year out to do anthropology. For my dissertation I am really interested in looking at the experiences people have had with using forums and online support groups for OCD (I have OCD myself, but am new to these), particularly during this pandemic where so much of our lives have shifted online. I am also interested in talking about previous experiences of mutual aid groups. As part of this, I am looking to interview (via zoom) adults over the age of 18, who have visited an OCD related forum (including this one), or used a support group for OCD at least once since March 2020, and identify as having symptoms of OCD. It does not matter if you have only posted once or not at all!

Due to the nature of the topic, there is a possibility that the interview could lead to recall of a distressing period of time. In the interview you will be in charge: if there is a topic of conversation that you are not fully comfortable discussing please let me know either in advance or if it comes up. I will ensure that you are made aware of the nature of the conversation and proposed questions in advance.

OCD,"Vent/Question:

How the hell do I cope with living with people who don’t respect me and my mental illness. Even pre-Covid I’ve struggled with contamination based obsessions and compulsions but they’ve gotten exponentially worse. As time goes on, and people get more impatient with stay at home orders my anxiety only gets worse.

My family don’t respect my requests to keep their distance from me in the home, they go out, visit family and friends without wearing masks, it just pisses me off. Without OCD it would piss me off due to the lack of empathy and selfishness that they display when doing these things but I feel like I’m going CRAZY!!!! They gaslight me, sneak behind my back to go to non-essential social event, and I have to constantly overhear by accident or find out on Facebook that my family members haven’t been safe and have been out and about. 

Every time I start to let my guard down and my mental health and triggers seem to get manageable I find out something that my family did behind my back that makes me spiral over and over again. I don’t have the financial means to live on my own, and I’m terrified to move during a pandemic anyways. If I could have it my own way I’d live completely on my own so I’d have a bit of control over who comes into MY safe space..

What the hell do you do when the people you live with invalidate and disrespect you all the while make you feel like you’re crazy for wanting them to do there bare minimum that the government demands?

Also I got vaccinated last month because I’m a healthcare worker, but my obsessions have gotten almost worse sense then. Half of me thinks I may have a tiny bit of protection but I still am extremely cautious and only go out for work or grocery shopping, meanwhile the other half of me thinks that my vaccine was ineffective because I had no reaction to it and that I’m just as vulnerable to getting sick and possibly killing my family and patients that I work with whom are all extremely high risk. The constant fear of killing others in general have been BAD, but COVID has only made these things exponentially worse..

I know this rant is going on long and I went on a bunch of tangents but how do you cope with not even being able to feel safe in your own house or even your own room? I spend hours doing cleaning rituals every night and I’m losing sleep and I’m extremely stressed out because of all of this.

Let us please remember that when people have intrusive thoughts or worries- we all want reassurance that something bad isn’t going to happen. 

Most people with OCD have anxiety. I myself will ask the same question over and over until I feel reassured. 

Also Remember that OCD also comes with the compulsion to confess and people have the need to urgently clear their minds. 

Please try to recognize that people are not over posting to be annoying but rather are suffering with a thought or compulsion and are in need of reassurance. 

EDIT: Instead if reassurance I should have said positive comments and love

OCD,"It's been nearly a year since I noticed that one of my closest friends started suffering OCD. Since lockdown he rarely leaves home, so we see him less. He stopped answering to text messages, so we can just talk to him if we ring his house-bell.

We never talk about it with him, because we can't find a way in which it's organic and not intrussive. 

I tried to talk about it with him once, we were on our own. I asked how he was doing with OCD. Maybe it was too direct, or I did something wrong, but he told me he stopped going to the psychiatrist and taking his medication because he wanted to take over this on his own, and that he thought that his condition had inproved.

That was about three months ago, and we see him less and less. 

His mom told us he doesn't want to tell you more than his son does, because she would find it disrespectful.

I would appreciate some suggestions or help for us to have the possibility to help him out with this. Should we talk with him about it? Or we should just try him to spend as much time us possible with us forcing him to leave his house?

I'm a psychology student so I feel like I have the most responsability on our group of friends (maybe it's an irrational thought, tell me what you thing about it)

OCD,"My partner of 1.5 years has ocd. We live together. In the past year, their symptoms have gotten worse. They can’t really cook in the kitchen bc any form of “contamination” leads to an angry meltdown. They are distracted 24/7 with pressure from work and other stressors, which only leads to an amplification of symptoms. I have been asking for over a year for them to get help. They kept saying when they get a minute of rest, they will schedule an appointment, but so far that moment has not presented itself. I keep putting pressure on them to seek help, despite knowing they don’t like the pressure bc I feel so alone and isolated in supporting them. 

I love my partner so much, and it hurts seeing them buckle under this disease. What can I do to support them? How can I get them to finally schedule and appointment with a trained ocd therapist?",Partner has ocd. How do I help?

OCD,"Hello everyone, it's been 10 years today since I've developed my first mental health issue. I was 16 y.o.

At first it all started with a panic attack disorder then then into an agoraphobia then into depression and now in obsessive mind disorder. I've been in therapy with my psychiatrist The last four years, I've taken my meds (mostly xanax and antidepressants) and right now, in this very moment, I'm not taking anymore. So you can say step forward have been made. Life has been rough. I've spent my best years worrying, paranoic, thinking always the worst, fighting for a Better future. I honestly think I Will Never be the sale happy guy I was when I was 16.

My psychiatrist says I should be proud of Who I am and what I've done so far, that I've done a lot and I've changed a lot in Better during these last 4 years.

But I think I will never be satisfied until I will Be Free and I'll know that I will never be free again.

A Year ago My psychiatrist said that I know developed an obsessive disorder. Weird thing is I have my mind full obsessed but I do not suffer of compulsion. It's like my mind is always thinking 24/7 and I can't stop it in any way. Even under xanax, it just keep going, the only benefit is that most of my thoughts doesn't make me so anxious as normally does.

My obsession are of different kind, sexual, violent, sometimes depressing (i.e. I imagine to be at the funeral of people which I love and are alive), sometimes are instead focused on new hobbies which I don't really like, or things wich I could not care less or even dreaming a better future, but in an unhealthy way, making plan the obsessive way.

I don't know how to deal with this and honestly I'm tired. It's been a 10 year fighting and I just can't take it anymore. Does anyone suffered of the same problem? How did you deal with it? I have the feeling that I will always be like this and there is no escape.
I feel like there is no solution anymore and even when I some the problem what do I have? I wasted my golden years being a lone weirdo. I know have a girlfriend but I'm not happy about myself and I watch my past life full of remorse.

OCD,"Hi, I'm 27F and have been on 20mg Escitalopram (Lexapro) for several years now. Recently, I have felt my OCD getting a bit out of control and my doctor recommended switching to Paroxetine (Paxil). Naturally, I have become obsessive about this (it has been 4 days since the convo with my doctor and I have spent 24+ hours researching Paxil in research journals, etc). The anxiety about switching is now completely consuming my life and I literally can't focus on anything else. I have called my doctor to discuss further, but she can't fit me in until next week and I do not think I can handle feeling this way until then. So, I'm hoping to hear about others' experiences. 

&amp;#x200B;

Questions/concerns I have:

1) Does anyone have experience switching SSRIs? Did you have a better experience upping the dose of your current SSRI or switching to a new one altogether?

2) I've done a lot of research and it sounds like Lexapro is generally much preferred to Paxil. I am now having panic attacks at the thought to switching to Paxil because it sounds ""less tolerable"". Does anyone have experience switching to this (I realize everyone is different... but some positive experiences could be comforting)?

3)  We are tapering off the Lexapro over the next two weeks... I'm on the 10mg now and I literally feel out of control. I can't stop crying and am having withdrawal symptoms (chills, night sweats, bad dreams, headache, brain fog). This is making me feel like switching is not worthwhile :(

OCD,"———TRIGGER WARNING: TALKS ABOUT OBSESSIVE/INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS THAT INCLUDE VIOLENCE AND SELF HARM——— 
So every night before bed, I take my medicine because it makes me very tired (fluvoxamine.) Last night, I crashed early after I got home from a long shift at work and when I woke up I realized I forgot to take my meds. I had a pretty busy day planned, so I was a little nervous but thought I’d be fine because I already went so long without being medicated. I was insanely wrong. I have obsessive and intrusive thoughts about really gruesome acts of violence happening to me, like really  really messed up things. I am obsessed with the idea that someone I love is going to kill me or torture me and they are going to do it when I am not looking, they just won’t do it because they know that I have the feeling it will happen to me. Obviously I am dead wrong and I know that, but my body feels like I am preparing to have to run and fight for my life all the time, it’s dead set on the fact someone is going to mutilate me to the point where I wish they would just kill me. 

I went on a trip to a rural small town today to go with my aunt to an appointment and to see some cool local shops, the entire time I was slowly starting to be consumed by unwanted thoughts.
-“She is going to put that cigarette out in my eye. Look away so she doesn’t have the chance.” 
-“She is going to swerve into a car on purpose and it will kill the both of us. Where are your legs, how can you protect them from breaking if so?” 
-“it would hurt if you bit off your thumb” 
-“it would hurt if someone skinned you”

Those were just some thoughts running through my head at the time. I went home and soon had to hang out with my boyfriend who I had planned on going to the gym with. We skipped today bc decided to get a healthy dinner and go for a short hike. We had many conversations but I kept really focusing on violence. We started talking about animals and immediately thought about all the things that could maul me; then he started talking about going to Kodiak, Alaska for the military and BOOM guess who is thinking about Kodiak bears and being pinned and eaten alive by a bear!! This sexy mentally ill gal right here that’s who. Here are some thoughts I had through out our time hanging out that played in repeat in my head. 
-“A bear could pin you and eat your organs while you’re still alive and you could do nothing about it.” 
-“imagine being mauled by a tiger”
-“what if someone slit your throat. It would hurt. There would be so much blood and you’d know what was happening too.” 
-“your boyfriend is going to bite your jugular out, do not let him hug you or get close to your neck.” 
-“what if I slammed my leg in the car doors until it was mangled. What if it happened to my fingers.” 
-“don’t ever use a gun. You will end up shooting your self.” 

As soon as I got home tonight I took my meds and I’m getting tired and feeling better. I think I need a higher dosage because I have horrible panic attacks induced from the stress my OCD causes, it gets to the point I can’t move or breathe properly and no one can touch me because I feel like they are going to hurt or kill me. I still have small intrusive thoughts here and there, but the anxiety often isn’t nearly as much and the feelings aren’t so overwhelming. 

I will have visions of someone taking a bite out of my skin on my forearm. I will see (all in my head ofc bc these are intrusive thoughts/visions) someone shooting or stabbing me while I’m out anywhere, even at work. I have trouble sleeping at night because I’m obsessed with the thought that someone is my household is going to kill me in my sleep. While my family isn’t perfect, they would not hurt me like that and I know it, but I don’t believe it if that makes sense. 

Anyways, does anyone else have a similar obsession or issue with that? Has anyone else stopped taking their meds on accident for a day and getting really squirmy and uncomfortable and sometimes nauseous? Also, does anyone else get a nervous twitch or tick when you get a really bad and messed up intrusive thought because often my head will snap to my shoulder or I will blink hard and excessively and shake my head. Sorry for all the questions, but I have been struggling for so long and feel like I’m going crazy and I kinda just need some kind of understanding or validation from people who understand how hard and frustrating this is.

OCD,"Hi there,

&amp;#x200B;

So I'm in the middle of a bit of a dilemma. It's with my current therapist. See she is what is considered an ""OCD expert"", by that I mean she's listed on the [iocdf.org](https://iocdf.org) website and is apparently the kind of therapist I should be seeing.

The thing is and I know this myself because I've done the research - we have done ZERO exposure therapy - and as you all know- that's the gold standard therapy for OCD. Truthfully, I don't even really know how she has helped me OCD wise. She often confuses me frankly.

Now the problem is she's one of the nicest/most caring therapists I have yet to encounter - I had a few difficult moments and didn't hesitate to accommodate me when necessary. 

But the thing is, ultimately the reason why I am seeing her is because she's an ""expert"" at treating OCD. And if I'm not making any progress with my OCD while seeing her, as I haven't - why should I see her?

The problem lies with insurance frankly. See another big reason why I'm seeing her she's ONE OF FOUR therapists (out of like 30) who take Medicaid, and if you don't know what that is - that's the government sponsored insurance program for people below a certain income - here in the United States, where I live.

And truly, I'm sort of in between a rock and a hard place. If I stop seeing her altogether then I risk being caught with out a therapist in general and will be forced to scrap around somehow (if possible). Truthfully, I want to stay with her, but I also want to get better.

This whole time I've been waiting for her to give me some sort of program or guideline to follow so I can finally make the progress I need to make. But she doesn't say anything about ERP. I've also out of necessity have had to resort to self-education through books on Amazon that do help administer some sort of ERP, ""Freedom From OCD"", by Dr. Jonathon Grayson being one of my favorites. 

Now like I said, I could use the help, but I suppose if I have to do exposures on my own, I might do that (which I've already started). But like I said, help would be nice.

Anyways, if you read through all that and have some advice to give - I would appreciate it.

OCD,"hey. i’ve had ocd for around 4 years. i recently had a really bad panic attack after smoking weed that put me into a state of depersonalization. i get so many scary thoughts about things like eternity, the fact we’re on a giant flying ball going through outer space, and existence. i feel nothing but panic every single day. i am scared i might kill myself/something will happen to me 24/7. i feel so disconnected from reality and i cant even function correctly anymore. everything just feels so scary. i wanna start therapy but i have to wait a few weeks. i don’t even know where i am going with this. i just feel so trapped and hopeless. does this sound like existential ocd? i don’t know what’s wrong with me and i can’t take it...",is this existential ocd?

OCD,"Well now my intrusive thoughts have me scared that I may be a sociopath. I am a 27 year old woman with OCD and health anxiety. Suspected borderline personality but I don’t meet the criteria anymore (since a few years ago). 

Some background info: In childhood I went through trauma. I have always been the black sheep of my family. I was bullied relentlessly and I remember feeling depressed as early as 5 or 6. I have always had a very strong sense of embarrassment. I was very shy and didn’t have a lot of friends. I was also very sensitive. I loved my pets, and I remember their deaths being very difficult for me. I wrote a poem for my grandmother’s 20 year old cat who passed when I was 12. 

I had depression and anxiety in high school and I have been on many SSRIs, benzos, and even an antipsychotic. I’m not on anything now. I used to cut, but I haven’t in years. 

When I watch an emotional video about animals or old people, I cry. Sometimes I can’t stop. There’s a poem that goes “when tomorrow starts without me” that was attached to a video on a TikTok about a cat who had passed away and when I think about it I start to tear up because I think about my kitty who suddenly passed away when I was 21. He died in my arms of a heart attack - I heard him screaming from another room and ran out to see what was going on. It was too late by the time my mom got on the phone with the vet. Losing him was incredibly painful and I don’t think I actually recovered properly. 

Regardless of these things, a friend will tell me she’s got a stomach ache or throwing up, and I don’t think I feel anything? Like I mean, it sucks and I hope they get better, and I would do what I can to help them, but I just feel empty about it? Am I supposed to have a heart crushing feeling of sadness to experience empathy? Or is it enough that I understand that she is feeling unwell and crappy and that her day is ruined cause of it? When a friend says they got rejected, I mean I know the feeling of rejection, but I don’t feel it when they tell me they feel it. 

I have done morally reprehensible things in the distant past which I don’t want to talk about but I am working through forgiving myself for those things. I feel immense guilt/shame for those that were affected by my actions and actually lately it has even been all consuming... like why did I do those things in the first place? If I feel guilt/shame/remorse, I can’t be a sociopath. So what makes someone do hurtful things to others? Pain and suffering of one’s own? 

One more thing I wanted to add, I am in love. I have a beautiful fiancée and I’d do anything for her. She is amazing and I never want her to feel hurt or sorrow. I feel a sense of well-being when I hug her or cuddle her. I think it’s the oxytocin. I just know when I am hugging her, I feel ok. When she cries, I cry. We don’t fight or argue. I always try to be the best I can for her, I try to surprise her with treats when I can. 

But still... sometimes I feel like I don’t have empathy. Do I seem like a sociopath??? I don’t want to be. I want to grow old with my fiancée and get married to her, and have a simple life. I don’t want to think that I don’t have empathy. I WANT to have empathy but sometimes idk if I really do. I’m so fucked up over this I don’t even know how to continue with my life. I’m stuck on something bad I did a few years ago (I won’t speak of it but all parties involved are okay, that is all I wanna say). Like I said I am consumed with guilt and I have been praying that the individual I hurt has found healing and also that I will forgive myself one day and that God will forgive me. 

Idk...",Intrusive thoughts about sociopathy
OCD,"I have ocd but I dont know if this is part of it so I dont really know where else to post this. Here's the story:

So basically a little background, my girlfriend and I have been together for 5 months already (LDR and met once last feb 27) and we've spent most of those 5 months time together. This is my first relationship and my girlfriend came from a relationship where she got cheated on. For the time that we have been together, I can clearly tell that she's already moved on from her past relationship and that she doesn't miss her ex at all anymore. In short, our relationship is going pretty well.

Recently, we had encountered and are dealing with an issue. She doesn't have that much of a close relationship with the older people in her family so her family started spreading rumors that she was seeing her ex since january this year. It came to the point where she even heard her aunt wanting to talk to my parents about it. She basically got so fed up about her family picking their nose in our relationship so we decided to be on a break for a while. (My girlfriend was the one that told me all this).

So the problem now is that I keep imagining my girlfriend and her ex seeing each other even if I know damn well that it didn't happen. This thought has been popping up in my head for the past few days now and it's the first time in my life where I'm getting so affected by a rumor to the point where I'm even imagining how it happened(or how it didnt happen). I've been dealing with intrusive thoughts for quite a while now so I don't really know if it's part of it.

At the time the issue was happening and how she was telling me all about it, I felt fine and wasn't affected by the rumor at all. I would say that I even handled the situation pretty well but as mentioned, a few days later, the rumor kept affecting me.

I've been telling myself that it isn't real, it didn't happen and that it's just a rumor. I've even tried accepting it and mocking the thought but it somehow just keeps coming to me and I'm so tired of it.

I really want to know if anyone else experienced/is experiencing something like this, if it's part of intrusive thoughts and how to deal with it.


Note: Idk if this is relevant to the situation but I've always hated her ex after what he's done.

Another note: My girlfriend is really loyal based on a lot of evidence and experience so the rumor didn't happen

Another another note: I've been dealing with my intrusive thoughts through self ERP and it's actually working pretty well. For example, I would get thoughts that I would cheat on my girlfriend and I might lose control. So I would challenge myself to try to flirt or message other girls and it would make me more anxious. Because of this I get less of the thought and it doesnt affect me that much anymore. Would also want to know if anyone knows how to do ERP for this thought",Heard a rumor and now it's affecting me
OCD,"Okay, so I’m undiagnosed but I just had a question. 

I’ve dealt with hair pulling since I was about 5. I think I do it most when I’m incredibly stressed (when I was a kid it was moving and being kind of lonely, now it’s quarantine and school and intrusive thoughts stressing me out). I don’t necessarily get an urge to do it. I just subconsciously start pulling, yanking roots off, etc etc what have you. HOWEVER my partner really tries hard to help me stop (it’s also a source of stress as my hair is VERY thin now), but often if they try to  move my hand or distract me I get almost angry? I know they’re trying to help and I feel bad for feeling so angry about it.

I’m mostly just wondering if anyone with OCD experiences this type of compulsion as well? I’ve looked into Trichotillomania (sp?) but I’m mostly just seeing if anyone else has this issue

OCD,So I’ve just learnt that the government can make rain and snow (I didn’t know this). Am I crazy to think they could do this where I live? Also am I crazy for thinking this could be what happened in Texas? I’m always leery with taking this stuff seriously but it was on big news channels and things. It honestly makes more sense to me that’s what happened in Texas than it being out of nowhere. But this has made my OCD worse and I’m freaking out that I’m going crazy,I have a fear of going crazy. Does this make me crazy???
OCD,"I have this overwhelming sense of dread and it’s becoming so hard to deal with today. It’s been nagging me for a little bit now but it’s becoming really bad today. I can’t pay attention to anything because I feel like I did something wrong or need to do something or something bad will happen. I hate this feeling because it makes no sense. I’ll be sitting there feeling it and think to myself, “nothing bad is going to happen why am I feeling this way? Why don’t I just stop?” But then I can’t just stop and I get so angry at myself. I’d give anything right now to just get rid of this feeling. I don’t get why I have to deal with this and other people don’t. I hate that I get jealous of other people for that.

It went away after that and now I'm 19. A friend expressed possible romantic interest and I can't stop feeling bad about it. Its been almost a year and he's long since lost interest. I genuinely believe him when he says that he's not hurt and wants to be friends still. But fuck. I can't stop thinking about it. Can't stop looking up reddit posts about best friends falling in love, can't stop replaying our interactions over and over in my head. Can't stop feeling guilty, both because I didn't date him and both because I get paranoid that deep down I do like him.  It's even affecting me liking other people because I can't even enjoy my attraction to women without wondering if ""maybe I don't really like women as well as men, maybe I'm trying to use them as an excuse for not dating""). Nothing he's said or done since has hinted at him wanting anything more with me anymore, and I know he wouldn't lie about something like that.

OCD,"Don't even really know why I'm writing this. I'm 21 years old, in community college, living at home, and my mental health spiraling downwards exponentially. For the past 5 years I've dealt with depression and anxiety and thrown my life entirely off track. I dropped out of high school to ""do online school"", quit that, got a GED and sat on my ass for years in my parents house smoking weed and playing games all day. Honestly looking back I thought it couldn't get any worse than how I felt then. Boy was I wrong...

I think going back at least 2 years ago I can identify OCD like tendencies forming, really just little things, making sure my door was locked an extra time, double checking the fridge was closed, making sure my car windows were up etc. Thought it was just anxiety, but slowly I began to realize that these once somewhat benign thoughts turned into much more aggressive intrusive thoughts. Those simple ""rituals"" turned in serious time sinks. Going up and down the stairs to make sure the door was locked over and over, back and forth to the car to check the windows/doors, and closing the fridge door repeatedly until it felt right or until I was seriously so mad I just forgot about it.

I already thought that was bad enough, but when covid started, it went downhill fast... Before I could even realize I was fully engulfed by contamination OCD. I was constantly analyzing every single thing I touch, not eating with my hands, reheating food, and of course, washing my hands an insane amount. It got to the point where my hands were incredibly dry and cracked it actually hurt physically just as much as mentally.

This was just the beginning. I already had health anxiety and have spent thousands on finding out if small symptoms were going to kill me. From one thing to the next, colon cancer, melanoma, nasal cancer, HIV, getting a girl pregnant, stis, and god knows what else. Time and time again I'd through tests and wait to see the results. Just to find out nothing is wrong, and within days or weeks I am on a new thing to obsess about. 

The most recent is where I really realized this is not sustainable long term. My house has mice in it and honestly never thought much of it, kind gross but was w/e. I went to fix something with my cars ventilation system and found a mouse nest. Carelessly cleaned it up and then after realized that was not smart. Started reading about hantavirus, the plague, infections etc. etc. I went into full blown panic researching everything, calculating my chance of infection, chance of death, on and on. This was already bad enough

Of course after this, just to add the cherry on top I was sitting in my room (researching that bs) and a mouse jumped on me and bit or scratched me on the hand. I legit lost it, I actually didn't know what to do, I stood in my bathroom for hours with my hands out in a full blown panic just not knowing what to do. Could have been easily 4+ hours of doing this, absolutely lost on what I should possibly do. Eventually passed out of the toilet and awoke to still be in the nightmare, thoughts of rabies, the plague, hantavirus, etc. etc. Went to the hospital and did the whole nine. Rabies shots, antibiotics, ""wound care"". Cost an arm and a leg. Really the rabies obsession is still fizzling a bit but at least I can mentally fall back on the vaccine. 

I don't know what to do anymore, I'm broke as a joke, have to leave my parents soon, still in full blown contamination OCD, with the new obsession being HIV ofc... I don't know how possibly I can get a job and function like this. Maybe I deserve all of this, idk... I messed up my life with addiction and spiraled down since.

What really makes me so hopeless, is when I am finally free of my current obsession (whether its a day or a couple weeks, MAYBE a month if I'm lucky). I am in increasingly worse bouts of depression. Where honestly I really wouldn't care what happens to me.

Before this all started I really was the happiest and most outgoing kid that was just happy to be here on earth. Through my own poor decisions and I guess genetic predisposition to mental illness, my life has fallen apart and I see no end in sight.

I'm honestly just so over this... I have done so much to try to make myself better: therapy, diet, exercise, getting into college, getting a job, meeting new people, trying to do fun activities, and putting myself out there. And everything just gets worse...

It was one thing dealing with anxiety and depression on their own (not trying to downplay them), but adding OCD makes it really seem impossible to ever be able to function normally.

I could go on and on about different obsessions and compulsions but honestly just thinking about them stresses me out as some of them are so insane it honestly makes me cringe.

I really wish I'd just wake up one day and this nightmare would be over. Or maybe just not wake up at all. I really wouldn't be too opposed to that. To be honest I don't want to die by any means, I would love to be happy, and well... sane, but it honestly just doesn't seem realistic anymore. Regardless, I'm still fighting this fight... Just seems to be a never ending war...

I guess after writing all of this, I really just wrote this for myself. Don't expect anyone to read it, because I sure as hell wouldn't in all honesty.",I'm lost

Before I start. I am a STRAIGHT male always have been BUT i struggle with sexual ocd and many other OCDs but for the sake of this post I will talk about sexuality ocd. I don't wanna hear ""oh its ok if you question yourself or feel attracted or think that you are..."" because I am straight and I have heard that plenty of times and it certainly doesn't help someone with OCD. Anyways here it officially goes...
All my life I have been a straight male and never ever struggled with any sexuality stuff. My first crush was a girl in kinder. I was a jock in hs basically so typical sporty guy. I started watching porn at 13 and never struggled with sexuality. Again I have always been straight and I know I am. However, three years ago I started suffering from severe sexuality ocd. At the time I didn't know this was ocd because although i've struggled with ocd all my life, it never escalated to that severity. I have my life planned out, would tear up thinking of an amazing life with kids and a wife that I can care for. Then thes thoughts hit me. It was a phone call with my ex and she started talking bout some gay guy at her job and LITERALLY out of no where my brain spoke to me ""what if you're gay."" And that made me very surprised that my mind even thought that. Hell I cringe in seeing two guys because I am straight. And i kept obsessing on it severely because I wanted to know ""WHY THE HELL DID I THINK THAT, WHY IS MY BRAIN TELLING ME THAT"" and it went on and on for about a year. I got depressed because I wanted to date a giel but the thoughts were severely taking a toll on my life. I ""lost attraction"" to females for a while when my ocd was extremely high. My mind tricked me into thinking i was maybe attracted to dudes which man just typing this makes me feel f****g weird. Doesn't sound like me, i cringe hard. Anyhow, i stopped obsessing over it FINALLY after counseling and my attraction to females came back again like normal and my thoughts never completely left but they sometimes come haunt me in different severities. I started obsessing to 'prove' my sexuality with women and i read a post here that it does harm to prove it. And it did. Now, I would like to live my life how i desire it and planned all my life. Will these sexuality thoughts ever leave? I get disturbed by them. I know I am straight, no doubt in my mind. But these thoughts come and go and sometimes hit hard and it messes with my confidence. At one point they made me feel like a weak, feminine dude which I am not and never was and it just made me avoid my bros and guys in general. I am a sports junkie and gym freak and feel like a weak feminine dude inferior to men because of my stupid dumbass ocd. It really did destroy my life. It changed who i am. I want my self again. I miss my normal self. The thoughts don't have the same power as they did, but i wish i never had them. It changed me. Makes me feel like a weak man. Makes me actually question my sexuality even though I always come to the same damn conclusion, that I am straight as I was always. At one point I considered doing so many things and oh God, thankfully I never did because I realize now my ocd was playing mind games and I would have been depressed. Reminds me of my uncle who waa curious and had sex with a dude and regrets it with all his life and it makes him feel like absolute crap cus hes straight. I've always encountered gay guys like school, work, etc, etc and it was never ever an issue. I avoided them for so long because my ocd would flare  up. I wanna be able to interact with everyone again like I used to and not have my mind play games on me. I avoided fellow men because I felt inferior or my mind would tell me 'what if u are attracted to them'. I don't like hanging out with females like friends because what the hell man all they do is girl stuff and I like doing man stuff. I had a vision for my life and still do. But ocd really screwed my thinking patterns. I want that amazing romantic relationship with a girl again that made me feel incredible. I don't wanna have to do it for the sake of proving my sexuality. I still struggle with those thoughts on ocassions, and I wish they were nevee here because when I get them i try to combat them but that never works, your mind is fixated on that thought. What can I do? How can I make this better? Will ocd thoughts (regardless of the topic) ever leave? Are they here to stay but all we can do is ignore it? Because once ur mind opens up a vessel to thoughts, well, they'll always be around. Advice is needed please.

Since I was 12 I have looked at cartoon porn, I always looked at it and enjoyed it. The only time that I have ever come across very fucked up age related cartoon porn was when I was 12 and came across the first and only loli image I have ever seen. Im still scared today (if my ability to remember something 6 years ago shows anything).

I had since I was young as a teenager had a naive approach to most online cartoon porn, in that if it was avaliable (e.g. on websites such as pornhub, xvideos or rule34 that it was okay, since these websites were so huge and easy to access). I only began to realise how wrong I was until 2 months ago. This is where it all started.

I was watching a film and had this sudden worry that this little girl in the film was ""attractive"", not in the sense of I would want to do anything, but cute like a dog or cat. However my brain clocked this in as a genuine sign of ""arousal"" and so I fell down th ocd hole.

I began the standard vetting process of my past, concluding that I couldent take any evidence from before I was eighteen, that worked as reassurance for a while due to my belief that any character I had masturbated to was around my age at the time (generally if they were 16, that was okay in my mind since 16 is age of consent in the UK and I am only 18 myself). It took a turn however when I realised characters from the show avatar (specifically the fire nation characters) were much younger than I thought they were. In addition a pokemon character who I thought was 17 turned out to be 12 (rosa if you google the characters name).

I had originally thought this since on the web these characters seem to be so sexualised that I assumed they ""had"" to be 16-17, especially rosa since one of the top results on google images is some weird sexual shit. This bugged me for the last 2 months but something recently pushed me over the breaking point.

I was going on with my day when I got the sudden urge to jack off to something I jacked off to years ago. Effectively this image  was a character from the game league, specifically the yordle character poppy, yordles if you dont know what they are, are small furry creatures who are like 2-3 ft tall, so already i know this sounds fucked. But, this image had this character with large breasts and I remember first seeing it when I was 14. I jacked off to this image, but now a few days later I find myself typing this right now. 

I actually feel like that incriminates me, that what I just typed means something, as this character was really small and I realised that other images of these characters (despite not being human) clearly play upon the fact they are ""small"".

I cant help but feel like I am some sort of genuine monster because after jacking off to that I immediately felt regret, disgust, self-hatred and doubt in myself that this is just ""ocd"". I get (what I believe) are gronial responses over characters I jacked off to when I was a kid, believing that I am still attracted to them today.

The thing is, I debate whether I would have even jacked off to that image of a yordle (if I wasnt having pocd) I am almost certain that I would not have and simply have forgotten it.

I know this post is effectively a giant reassurance check but I just dont know how to move on,  I never saw these small furry yordle creatures as anything in the slightest bit pedophillic since its so far from a child and the image i looked at, they had giant breasts. Yet, I still feel disgusting.

Just wanted to spill my story somewhere in full, since I dont know how long I can deal with this. The anxiety and guilt has hit a point where I cant find any enjoyment in life. I'd like to end the post by stating that I have only ever had this problem with CARTOON PORN and never anything real. I dont know if that absolves me of anything however.

**\*\*\*\*\*\*TRIGGER WARNING\*\*\*\*\*\***

&amp;#x200B;

**How it started, My symptoms and everything up until I found out about HOCD:**

For just under a year now I've been having what I think are intrusive thoughts about my sexuality, mainly that I might be bisexual. For my whole life I've only been interested in girls but I know its possible that I had unconsciously repressed any desire I have for men. I also have a lot of gay and bi friends so I wouldn't expect to have much homophobia if any so the discomfort and stress this caused me was quite confusing.

It feels like these thoughts originally didn't bother me and I felt secure in my sexuality, but at some point I found myself spending hours a day trying to prove and figure out if I am bisexual or not. This became very overwhelming and took up so much of my day that I would do anything to get a break from thinking about it but I could only get a few moments of relief.

One way I would try to figure out whether I was or not was to compare my attraction to men and women on social media, at first there seemed to be a clearly different feeling when looking at women which I would attribute to me being attracted to them and conclude that I'm straight but the more I thought about it and tried to envisage myself being with men the more confused I got and it was much harder to tell whether I am actually attracted to men. 

I started to become so hyperaware of my thoughts that I found myself having thoughts like ""you think they're good looking"" or ""they're hot"" before I had even seen the image of the person (e.g scrolling through instagram and feeling the butterflies/arousal feeling before I'd actually scrolled enough for the person to be in the image), I also had this once when I looked at handwriting and a few other non-sexual objects. It was at this point I realised there may be something else at play and that this was not normal sexual attraction I was used to.

Despite this realisation, I still couldn't shake the questioning and it came to a point where I felt that the only way I would be able to stop questioning myself was to accept that I was bi. I did just this and I felt a level of relief however this was exteremly short lived.

I woke up expecting all the questioning to stop but it went nowhere, I spent hours on forums reading about people's experience discovering they were bisexual and seeing if I could relate to it, lots of people reported having crushes on the same sex when they were younger and this was something I never experienced.

I read that the discomfort and lack of desire to be with men I was experiencing was likely internalised homophobia and that I should be around people who celebrate bisexuality and are allies of the LGBT+ community, I also read that leaning into my ""bisexual side"" would help me become comfortable with myself.

I was relatively confused by this advice as to my knowledge I was already surrounded by a group of people who celebrate their sexuality and consider themselves to be LGBT+. I always found that the thoughts I had were uncomfortable and while they weren't disgusting they just didn't sit well with me and I didn't wish to carry out any form of sexual or romantic relations with the same sex.

I tried to follow this advice and when I saw attractive men I tried to mentally image myself being with them sexually, this would make me very uncomfortable but I assumed this was a product of my internalised homophobia. I would always have to back out of these thoughts just cause of how much distress they caused however I could sometimes feel a level of physical arousal which almost cemented the fact that I was bi even if I didn't mentally enjoy the thought.

I thought this was all part of the acceptance process and somewhere in this period I started to feel a burning sensation/weird itch feeling in my anus that I would have almost the whole day, I came to the conclusion that this was an urge to engage in anal play and I had to finger myself to get rid of it. I was very discomforted by this sensation so I tried to just ignore it but it wouldn't go away even after days so I fingered my anus in the hope that it would go away. It seemed that the feeling subsided for an hour maybe, but then it was back, and then I was left with the thought that I may have actually enjoyed the anal play because I had a underlying desire to have anal sex with men.

This event caused a lot of distress by itself as I found that being in any position which could be seen as sexual (e.g sitting down, squatting, laying in weird positions) or anything that could bring attention to my anus gave me images of myself being penetrated or images of fingering myself which were very mentally distressing and made me avoid such things.

To make things worse, these images would sometimes come with a level of physical arousal (erections, tingles etc.) which to me would mean that I certainly want to be in these situations. This confused me so much and made me feel like (for lack of a better word) I was being *raped* by my mind. (I do not mean to be insensitive to people who have actually experienced such abuse and I know that such a mental image is quite simply uncomparable to rape, but I think the word encapsulates purely the fact that the sexual images were unwanted and caused horrible distress regardless of the physical state of my body)

I was sent into a horrible state of low mood and anxiety and most days I would just stay in bed and sleep for hours on end since it seemed to be my only escape and thoughts of suicide were pretty common. I lost a lot of enjoyment for the things I would normally love and every little task felt like an enormous hurdle.

&amp;#x200B;

**When I realised I may have OCD:**

I read a lot about people realising they're bisexual and I began to think to myself that it was quite unlikely for someone who is actually bisexual to be this distressed by the thought of doing things with the opposite sex. I did some research and I found out about HOCD/SO-OCD. I found that almost all the symptoms I had could be caused by OCD however I was sceptical since all my thoughts were related to sexual orientation and nothing else. Although this only provided temporary relief it was comforting that there was something responsible for the distress I was experiencing.

I have been diagnosed with OCD and I am currently going through ERP therapy which was going well and up until now I've felt like I had more control over my reaction to the thoughts, they also seemed to occur less and cause me less distress.

Yesterday I spent a lot of time researching the spectrum of asexuality and I was quite interested to read about the different types of attraction (aesthetic, romantic and sexual attraction) and I have a feeling I am somewhere on the spectrum based on my past experiences. However I think this excessive research and rumination about this may have kicked my OCD back into a more uncontrollable state and I feel much more compelled to know exactly where I am on the spectrum of sexuality.

**My problem (where I need help):**

I am in my second week of doing exposure therapy and one of my exposures is to put myself in the ""sexual"" positions I feared (e.g standing and sitting), so I repeatedly stand and sit on my chair and my mind will give me images of squatting on a penis and usually I would distract myself from that thought but since it's an exposure I try to stay in the thought. I find this very uncomfortable but I know it will help me in the long run.

The issue is, almost 100% of the time I do this I get a rock hard erection, and I have tried to associate no meaning to it, but it feels like this must certainly mean I enjoy the thought. When I went to do the exposure today my body had a similar response to when I get ready to masturbate which I was shocked and distressed by.

\*\*\*\*\*\*WARNING (GRAPHIC)\*\*\*\*\*\*

I had a thought that the only way I could know if I'm actually enjoying the thoughts is to masturbate to gay porn and see if I like it. When looking at it I was very uncomfortable but I remembered that this was a good way to see if it's really what I want. I found that my penis went limp a lot and it felt harder to get myself going than when I watch straight porn and most of it was disgusting but I did feel  aroused. I went back to straight porn after a bit of browsing because I didn't feel as good as I usually do watching straight porn but then I kept asking myself if it was only because I hadn't found the right video yet. So I went back to the gay porn and there was one feminine man who I found good looking so I masturbated to the video and I orgasmed. I felt sick afterwards, and many times through the video I thought to myself that I don't want to orgasm while watching the video but I told myself I *should* do it so I can be comfortable that I could be bi. 

**Bottom Line:**

I can say after this that I probably am somewhat bisexual and I doubt that I actually have OCD a lot, but I still feel just as uncomfortable thinking about any form of gay sex as I did before and it does not feel ""desirable"" to me. I just want to be with girls as thats what I know and feel good about but I cant help but feel like my feelings of discomfort are caused by some denial/repression of my sexuality or internalised homophobia which feels so wrong and discourages me from ignoring the thoughts. I really don't know how to deal with this as I feel the need to know if im bi so much that I am missing out on my classes and not doing any of my coursework as all my time is spent trying to figure this out.

**TL;DR:**

I was diagnosed with OCD and started ERP therapy for SO-OCD and it seemed to be going well but in one of my exposures which triggers images about gay sex, I experience what seems like sexual arousal (I get erections so similar to regular arousal it feels wrong to call it a groinal response) but I feel uncomfortable and feel like I do not desire the content of the mental images. I stupidly thought that the only way I could tell if I was bi would be to masturbate to gay porn. I fought through a lot of thoughts that I don't want to continue watching while I orgasmed but I ignored them as I believed that finishing the act would help me become comfortable with the fact I could be bi. This obviously didnt make me any more comfortable with being bi or with the gay thoughts but I think for sure I am at least somewhat bisexual, however I still feel the need to know exactly how bisexual I am. I feel like the problem has got out of hand again and I am missing important aspects of life (university, social life) in favour of researching and trying to figure out my sexuality.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd love to hear the experience of people dealing with SO-OCD, OCD in general or if u are bisexual yourself and if you guys have any advice I'd really appreciate it, also I'm finding this very hard to deal with as u can probably tell so if anyone would like to pm or something that would be pretty helpful.

OCD,"A lot of my ocd obsessions are about people judging me and thinking badly of me. Those are my most extreme ones.

OCD,"Thought I’d share my latest ritual since it’s giving us a chuckle.

I have health and safety OCD checking doors, stoves, lights, plugs etc. My husband has been leaving the door open on our old fridge by accident(it doesn’t shut well)which is now making me fridge obsessed I don’t want to be eating spoiled food! 

So now at night I stand to the side of the fridge while I count to 4 and make sure it’s closed but as I’m doing it now I’m putting my hand up to my eye like I’ve got a telescope🤷🏻‍♀️then I do the stove the same way😆 

Now bear with me, in my mind it blocks out any other distractions for a second when I’m counting and making sure everything is off and shut as there’s less for my eyes to focus on.

It was all fine till my husband caught me doing it, now he calls it my pirate shit and asks if I’ve found any 🐳 yet as well as shouting Thar she blows!

OCD,"Lately I've had serious fear of poisoning. I've been avoiding foods and it's been making me eat and drink less since I'm suspicious of everything. The only things I'm comfortable eating are things that Ive eaten before, so those are my ""safe foods"". Some days I'll practically only drink chocolate milk despite being lactose intolerant bc it's the only drink I know is safe. Opening almost every new beverage or food my immediate fear is that it was somehow poisoned. At first I knew this was irrational. My brain would say ""what if this is poisoned"", but it's been getting to the point where I can't tell if it's rational and my brain immediately goes to ""this IS poisoned."". I'll end up spending 30 minutes to an hour after trying something to make sure it's safe and only then will I continue to eat/drink it. Today I've been sticking to safe foods. I know everything I ate was safe. But for some reason my body is still freaking out. Anxiety causing difficulty breathing and physical symptoms,but I KNOW it's all safe this time!

Also if they dont reply like immediately or if the time they take between replying changes, or if their punctuation changes (i.e. insignificant meaningless things) it freaks me out

OCD,"I’m quite a big gamer and for no reason at all I’ve been having strong urges to delete all the games on my PS4, reset it and start again (save data, etc.) I have spent quite a bit of money on some of these games too. I really don’t want to delete everything but these thoughts won’t go away until I do.

My OCD has decided that I’m not fully experiencing the PS4 until I delete everything and start again (don’t even ask).

I would be very upset if I lost all my games and progress, but part of me thinks I should just do it to get some relief from these thoughts.

Do you think if I did delete everything then my OCD would need me to keep deleting new accounts for ‘full experiences’. This means that I would never be able to play the PS4 again.

OCD,"TL;WR: I teach myself illnesses with the true belief I have them, and I don’t even know who I am anymore besides a walking hoax, so I’ve become very suicidal and I NEED to know I;m not the only one with this type of hypochondria.

So, I’ve been diagnosed with OCD forever now, and I have hypochondria with it. However, I don’t have the average hypochondria of being scared of having an illness, I’m scared that I DON’T have the illness. Anytime I do end up “having” the illness, it feels just like a coincidence.

I guess it’s all rooted in my koinophobia- the fear of being normal. It’s weird that I have this, because I was bullied as a kid, but maybe that’s my coping mechanism? “I’ll show them” kind of attitude?

Anyway, I come out of great desperation and thoughts of suicide (good thing I’m too much of a coward to kill myself.) I hate this hypochondria. I KNOW it’s all in my head, and there are LEGITIMATE people suffering while I whine about something I’ve given myself for sh%ts and giggles,

^^^And I don’t even know who I am anymore.^^^

When I was about 8-10, my brother was undergoing cancer treatments. I was jealous of all of the attention, so I prayed to my god that I could get an illness that “Wouldn’t kill me, just make me really really sick.” I ended up with mononucleosis for 8 months (weight loss, migraines, all that jazz) that doctors could never diagnose. Regardless of whether or not this was just a coincidence (it always feels like a coincidence, I can never tell!) I am so ashamed. All of that time, money, and energy WASTED on me, when my brother needed it most. Thankfully he is healthy again, but here I am, throwing my own pity party and inviting new guests each week.

Today, I found out that my sibling has anxious tics. Well, I had been having facial tics for a few months (which have probably just been picked up because I thought they were cute) ands now they’re much more painful, I actually shout things, etc. I CAN control them to an extent, and when i forget about them they go away, but any time I think about them they get moderately severe again.

Because I don’t know who I am, I’m EXTREMELY suicidal and having terrible intrusive thoughts (every wall I look at, I imagine myself banging my head against it, all over, and the walls are just covered in large patches of blood everywhere I look). I’m having frequent manic and depressive episodes. I get nothing done. I would pull a stunt to get checked into a mental hospital, but I’d on’t think they could treat anything but my depression, which I have medicine for, anyway :(


(I was very hesitant on posting here, because I hate attention seeking (despite my constant need to stand out), but I’m terrified. I can’t move any further in life until I have some way to deal with this. It’s been years.) I ask that you’re kind and, if you don’t believe or don’t like what I have to say, kindly scroll away.

OCD,"Hello to all my fellow OCD warriors! 

So since the beginning of 2020 my OCD has flared up to a point where it’s becoming a chain reaction, from work -&gt; diseases -&gt; Harm OCD ( still freaks me out ) - health OCD ( tinnitus) and now i can feel relationship OCD is sneaking up on me!!!! 

I’m doing compulsions on all forms, DRs , therapist, internet, books , reassurance, talking , you name it. 

The two things that really freaked me out are harm OCD and thats the reason i started therapy ( mind you, i have never hurt an ANT ) it still really bothers me sometimes but im cooping with it, and health OCD especially Tinnitus.

I do have mild tinnitus ( I’m a DJ ) , but my obsessions about it have made it so much louder ! 

Recently i can feel that my Relationship OCD is flaring up and i also do some complications like chat to other woman which for me won’t lead anywhere but im not able to stop it since i always feel like my relationship is tooooo good to be true!

OCD,"so i was just around a child, they were playing and they almost fell so i grabbed them from their shoulder, while doing that my hand touched their chest and BOOM ""did i enjoy this? do i like it?"" so i decided to show that everything is ok and im fine (to myself) and then intentionally held them from their shoulders  (so the scenario repeats, my hand touching their chest) and nothing happened, i decided to ignore my ocd and focus on what i actually felt. the intention was not evil, the child was not touched sexually or for the purpose of having sexual pleasure, it is a very normal way to hold a child and i did this shit load of times before , i mean u know how it is if u grab a child from their shoulders and they are small, or for example when they get stubborn and start kicking so u have to grab them from their legs, thighs, arms, belly or whatever u can get so they dont fall on the ground! but my ocd now is going like ""u just molested a child"" ""u touched a child sexually"" 

tbh im over my pocd to some level, it developed into something else, but i still have casual thoughts related to it and what happened today maybe shows that i still have pedophilia ocd and it just changed the way it comes to me. i feel shit, i just held a child literally in the most normal way and now i feel like i abused them sexually, i always held children like this and in some moments of anger they kicked while i was holding them, almost fell, and then i had to grab them from their thigh while holding them from their arms at the same time AND IT WASNT EVER AROUSING OR ANYTHING LIKE WTF 

in case someone didnt get what happened, i hold a child in a way that would make my hand touch their chest witout even thinking about it, like i didnt want to have a physical contact with them like that. then my ocd tells me i enjoyed it, so i decided to shut my ocd up and hold the child the same way which is in no way sexual. u know how u hold a dog? a small dog, u probably want to hold them but whether u want it or not u will be touching their arms while doing that. yes its the exact same thing here, i hold a child knowing (yet trying to avoid) that my hand may be touching their chest when i hold them, it was not sexual or intented to be sexual, just a normal thing. and my ocd is like ""bro u just abused a child""",pedophilia ocd is a giant [nsfw word]
OCD,"*warning talking about obsessions related to driving*

So I’ve been diagnosed for almost two years now, but I can pinpoint my first obsessions and compulsions to *years* ago, like 2015 or 2016. The majority of my obsessions and intrusive thoughts involve driving on the interstate and over 95% of bridges, especially if they’re tall and/or long. 

Up until this year, I had been avoiding driving on them at all costs. Whether that’s going the long way to places, having someone else drive me when I needed them to, or not going to places all together. And I’d gotten good at it, to the point that when my psychiatrist would ask about driving I would brush it off or say I was too busy, because just the thought of going on the interstate brought me so much fear and I was getting by without doing that! *Until now.* I matched a guy online who lives an hour away from me and the quickest way to get to each other is via this *huge* bridge(The skyway if you’re from Florida and know it) that even people without OCD are made anxious by.  So right away I told him about my OCD and the next day he told me that it was almost a dealbreaker, but he had stuff in common so he still wanted to meet me. And this stressed me out, because for years now I do feel like a burden to my friends and family and I’ve felt very undeserving of love because of my OCD. Part of this is why I normally DONT date people out of my town, except my town’s election for my tastes is meh. And he was so cute and nice, I really wanted to meet him too. And we really hit it off, which sparked this sudden motivation to try. Because he is making 2 hour round trips twice a weekend just to take me to his place. I cannot let him do that forever, I cannot ask that if him forever. My goal is to be able to get to his place and back on my own. So I made goals and told myself I had to do them before the year is over. El oh el I’m using NOCD right now and it’s only a 9 week program, so I’m waaaaay ahead of schedule.

And I was wondering to myself “Are people going to think I’m just doing this for a guy and not myself? Am I doing this for myself?” But the more I’m doing ERP the more proud of myself I become and the more I realize how much my OCD had truly taken over my life. I’m back on the interstate now and able to take more bridges now, which means I’m getting places quicker, able to go to more places, and relying less on others. Even if things don’t work out with him, I’m going to continue my ERP. I know I can’t cure my OCD, but I can get control of it and take my life back. 

TLDR: I got really complacent letting my compulsions run my life, but I realized how much my life is improving by doing ERP.",I hadn’t realized how much my OCD was really controlling my life

OCD,"I need reassurance..
Okay so a few weeks ago I started getting a weird feeling down there when someone talked about scary or violent stuff and I thought I was slowly turning into a psychopath. I couldn't stop thinking about it. I felt so disgusted with myself.
One day I was sitting next to my sister while she was watching TV. I felt worried about my groinal responses so I decided to go to the bathroom and lock the door because I had no idea how to explain my problem to my sister without sounding crazy. Instantly, after I locked the door, I started crying like crazy. My heartbeat had probably never been that fast and I felt like I was gonna throw up. My face felt so puffy and it looked so red. I thought I had finished crying, so I went to sit next to my sister. I couldn't keep it inside me anymore so I asked her if I could talk about something and she said yes. I told her about the weird arousal feelings I've gotten down there and again, I started crying because I don't wanna be a psychopath. My sister got super mad because she had told me it's just my thoughts messing with me but when I asked about the groinal responses,  she didn't really have an answer to it.
Of course my parents had to come back home right at that time and they saw me crying. I had no idea how to explain them how I get arousal feelings from violent words when I hear them or read them even though I hate them, but I somehow managed to word it and my mom said it's just my hormones because I'm a teenager. I was shaking the entire time, I was still slightly shaking after a day or two.
I need reassurance that I'm not a sadistic psychopath. I don't want to hurt anyone. I really don't. If I'm being honest, before I did research about groinal responses, I was thinking of how I shouldn't live if I feel arousal by those kinds of stuff.

OCD,"Hello. I Was hoping maybe someone else who had similar fears could talk with me. The last 2 months have been hell for me in regards to my apartment. I live in an older, slightly deteriorating lower level of a house with my partner, son, and pets. Been here for 3.5 years now. Recently it’s been drawn to my attention that there is potential asbestos in numerous places throughout the home. On an enclosed porch in the form of shingles, that is used as a main entry way/ mud room. In my kitchen on the ceiling and one wall. In the bathroom, on 2 of the walls surrounding the toilet. In a pantry area that has no door, and is mainly used as cat box storage area and pet food storage area. The reason for my dismay is the fact that the one shingle on the porch has been damaged slightly from our door knob being slammed into it often over the past few years. I am also concerned because some of the ceiling in the kitchen has flaked off onto dishes and snacks and before knowing it could be asbestos, we would just wipe it away, or pick off and then go about our day. The bathroom is also a major concern, because we all spend a lot of time in there and that’s the room with water damage and the most risk of harm, in my opinion. The walls weren’t sealed to the door jamb properly, and there were a few holes nailed into suspected walls. There have also been walls nailed in every room in the house, even prior to use living here. I keep trying to rationalize that even with small damage, unless there are copious amounts of dust everywhere the risk is probably minimal. My partner painted over the shingle on the porch and then duct taped it so it can’t be damaged again. They also put caulking up in the bathroom over suspicious areas for my peace of mind (plus it looked really bad anyway). I just can’t shake the idea of what damage we have done to ourselves, and the idea of what if there are still fibers in the air or on our things slowly killing us. I keep googling and looking for more and more info or reassurance, and then I go looking for more potential asbestos products in the place. I’m scared to stay here another year or so as I’m trying to save up for a townhome of my own, but I don’t want to move into another apartment out of fear either, as moving will most likely cost me more money now and make it harder for me to get my townhome.

my life has been going downhill for like the past 6 months. i recently turned 18 and was ""diagnosed"" with ocd a month or 2 ago. im completely unable to function as a human being anymore. i have so much college work to do but i cant get any of it done. i want to drop out but my parents wont let me. my therapist cant even get through to my college to speak to them either. i just sit around all day feeling miserable and anxious. i want to kill myself but im unable to self harm out of fear (i have tried to cut myself but was unable to break the skin, so i just ended up scratching myself) and i dont want to make my parents upset. i got put on sertraline 100mg but i do not feel any better. i dont even know if its ocd at this point i just feel like a monster. i have horrible intrusive thoughts about pedophilia and to a lesser extent incest and zoophilia and it freaks me out to no end. i had an online friend who was a couple years younger than me and people thought we were dating and it always made me feel super uncomfortable. i always said no, and expressed that i wasnt interested in doing so either. they had problems with pedophilia, and id constantly be thinking about it because i didnt want to accidentally post/say something that could trigger them. id also wonder about what exactly happened to them, which made me freak out and feel super guilty. i felt so guilty for even talking to them, i tried to leave many times but they asked me to stay and i felt guilty about that too. i think i have bpd also, i was super attatched to them and craved their validation constantly and it was really unhealthy. i felt guilty for wanting validation from them, and they hardly ever gave it anyway. i had a dream a few months ago showing graphic visuals about that stuff and it made it all feel way too real. those visuals keep popping into my head and freak me out. whenever i click on a link to something my brain goes ""what if its child porn?"" and freaks me out. for reference, i have obviously never looked at anything like that and have no desire to. i dont have any desire to harm children in anyway either, i would never want to do something like that and pedophiles incredibly disgust me. i get this uncomfortable feeling in my groin and my cheeks and i feel like i need to throw up. it makes me need to pee constantly and i can go upwards of 10 times a day if im really anxious. im also super twitchy and constantly bounce my leg/move my fingers/twitch my eyes and head. i try to counteract it by thinking of a person that makes me happy but i feel so guilty for thinking about them. i cant even look at a child with out feeling super uncomfortable, even (completely unrelated to age) low numbers can freak me out. im so scared i just want it all to stop but nothings helping. i just want to be happy, but i dont think i deserve to be alive anymore. because what if im just a monster? im not completely sure who ""me"" is, and i think i have a dissociation/depersonalisation problem. like these thoughts arent me and its someone else. i have thoughts sometimes that are like ""you should kill yourself"" and ones where im talking against the thoughts saying things like ""can you please shut the fuck up"" and ""please stop"". its all so strange. i dont feel real and i dont want to anymore. thanks for reading, i just needed somewhere to vent",i feel like im at my limit

OCD,"Somehow I have the same pitfall with many of my ocd themes. And hopefully you understand somewhat what I mean by this and or how i could best deal with this.

Namely, it is so that my OCD appears as the omniscient, as if I have obtained some sort of superior responsibility and insight through OCD. And that if I choose not to do anything with it. I will be punished for this forever (even after my death). (I am not religious by the way).

Until today I was often still able to deal with this, because I thought at those moments; *I just go against it and if I have to pay for this after this life then so be it, but if my wife and children have a 'normal' father and husband in their life because of that, then I want to sacrifice myself for that.*

However, now I have received a certain 'message' from the all knowing' fthat if I do not fulfill my 'obligations' which I am given in form of my superior responsibility and insights, that not only will I have to atone for it forever, but also my children, and that I pass this on to my children. So it will punish my children as much as it will me, because it started to notice i was ok with beding punisched myself.

This has meant that I can no longer hide behind the thought*; I do sacrifice myself for my children.*

What should I do now? I would like to think that these are all deception and false tricks from the ocd. But it really feels like THE truth in my case.

And so when I go against that, I constantly have the feeling that I am forever condemning my children to suffering, pain and damnation.

OCD,"So since we had our baby (she's one year now) my mind has always been scanning and coming up with the most horrific scenerios. Walking through Walmart toy section, ""oh my god marbles, she would choke and die on those"". It's never just normal thoughts about things babies can't have, it's always the most extreme, terrible scenerios. At night I lay in bed and think ""oh my god what if someone snuck in her window and took her and I wouldn't have enough time to get out of bed, find some sort of weapon, chase them down, then what if I was going to catch him and he decided to throw the baby on the pavement just because he's evil"" and I get so worked up. Then I lay in bed feeling worried that someone might actually break in and I have to spend time calming myself down. These kinds of thoughts happen daily. Is this anxiety mixed with being a new parent or am I truly paranoid? I have a very bad phobia of schizophrenia so whenever I realize that I might be paranoid I freak out and start asking myself if I'm crazy and it's just a never ending cycle.",Anxiety or paranoia??

OCD,"So I was watching the night stalker series on Netflix and the scene popped up with the six year old who got r*ped by him, but she survived and grew up and she told the tale, the minute I heard that I flipped and started thinking about children. Since then the thought of sexual stuff with children has been on my mind 24*7 it's very rarely imagery it's just like a sentence popping at me. Not really a sentence but you know when information exists and you just know information well this is information I do not want to know. I have a younger brother (12) and obviously I've seen him naked by mistake time to time, sometimes I've had weird intrusive thoughts,not sexual just creepy cos I've seen someone naked. But now those images and thoughts are popping up more viciously wrt my brother but when I'm talking to him in the moment I don't feel anything but right after I remember I'm having these intrusive OCD thoufhts and then I'm thinking about it? Like I'm genuinely sure I'm not a pedophile but this thought train is just stuck in my head 24*7 every minute that I don't sleep and this random imagery is getting too far. Yesterday I walked down the street in sweats and tears when I saw children, I didn't picture a single of them naked just the thought of the topic going on in my head and the fact that they're children. But today it's been a bit better I went out saw two kids walked past them reassured that nothing's wrong it's just me but then I've had groinals sometimes I was freaked tf out cos I wasn't even aroused. But the slightest bit of flirting w a woman now gets me aroused a lot and it makes me feel v weird and idk if this all is just babbling but I'm 19 and I've never ever felt anything like this and I just don't know please help if you've read.",maybe pOCD.

OCD,"I'm reading a lot of articles about coping with intrusive thoughts and they all say like ""just let them pass, thoughts dont hurt people,"" and that makes sense when you think about like physically yelling, breaking things, or hurting people. But what if your thoughts aren't physical, like wishing people get cancer or cursing them and stuff like that?

I remember in 7th grade in social studies we were reading our textbooks and there was this one anecdote about a beaver/badger and butterfly/bee creating the earth, and then one of them got angry and cursed the other one. Except the book quoted whatever said the curse and its been stuck in my head for more than 10 years... On one end obviously the bee or badger whatever didnt make the universe, its just some dogshit story, but they did quote whatever was supposed to be the curse and ever since then it keeps running in my head on family members and shit and I try so so so hard to deny it every time...

OCD,"I've been suffering from anxiety headaches for like 5 months, like everyday is painful, and the headaches hurt so much. First, I went to the doctor and did and MRI scan thought there was something wrong with my head, but my brain and head were completely fine after the scan, then I tried something called Deanxit, It kinda makes your headaches less painful, but It doesn't solve the problem, and it makes you soo sleepy and tired. I tried accpeting these anxiety thoughts for a while and still nothing happened, I tried exposing myself to anxiety thoughts for like months, and it made me much worse, and gave me more painful headaches, The only time i feel better is by avoiding the anxiety feeling and thoughts, But I don't think doing this will solve the problem.

You go to youtube , stare at the white screen for an hour , and end up feeling even more miserable.

OCD,"I started seeing someone on there and was told I was out of network for NOCD so I paid the full $123 per session and planned to file out of network claims with my insurance. Long story short, I stop seeing the therapist because he’s 10+ minutes late to our first two sessions and never made up the time

Anyway I filed a claim for the first session while I waited for the other sessions to be adjusted for missed time and it was approved almost right away. I called my insurance and they sent the check to the therapist who I’m no longer seeing which could easily be an insurance mistake, but this revealed something.

The therapist I was seeing was actually in network and I was fully covered (mental telehealth is free under my insurance). It was NOCD that was out of network. I was on the phone with billing and asked what exactly I was paying for that I couldn’t get by reaching out to the therapist who’s listed publicly on their site. The app is free. ERP is not patented. Apparently, all you pay for is the chat feature. They actually said this...lol like email or text isn’t a thing. To make things even worse, the therapist completely ignored my messages in the chat feature and would reply with blog posts like a robot.

Anyway, just needed to vent about this because this has honestly exacerbated my OCD and wanted to make sure others don’t fall into this trap",PSA: therapy via NOCD is a rip off
OCD,"So it’s 5AM here and I don’t want to type for hours on end when I haven’t slept in more than 17 hours so some parts will be direct copy and paste from another post I made. This is also my first time here and I understand that OCD is highly misrepresented and misunderstood so please tell me if I have misrepresented or misunderstood anything 

So my social anxiety is a little less well known in that it always feels like the complete opposite of it. Basically I'm able to spark a conversation with strangers without anxiety, to the point where I feel like there's nothing to lose and in some cases where there's a spark, I feel like I can be myself. But the moment they start being a consistent person in my life is when I start freaking out. The anxiety use to be a bit more subtle than this but  I'm basically just feeling chronic stress from just having people who aren't my family recognize who I am. 

I’m getting better at it though. It helps to have a group that recognizes who you are but isn’t having a full blown conversation with you, so they’re more just distant acquaintances really. The insomnia also helps me just forget that I have social anxiety in the first place so it’s weirdly getting better the less I sleep. However, it still frightens me when I do get closer to people, even when I actually want to cause they seem fun to hang out with, and I’m typically really cautious about making new friends because I know if they won’t abandon me then I probably will so there’s no point in starting a friendship with strings attached. Basically when I do make a potential friend, I’m reminded of how much overwhelming effort went into my old social life (I’ll get to that in a sec) and then I freak out history is going to repeat itself and I end up forcing myself to be awkward when I’m really not. There’s also the fact that I pushed away everyone who was close to me, and apparently they still remember me and try to check up on me even though I can’t bring myself to respond back to them so that’s nice. 

But what use to happen was I would get anxious of them abandoning me and leaving me alone, so I would always try to be a perfect friend. Respond on time, or else they'll slowly stop talking to you and leave. Say the right thing, or else they'll think you're boring and leave. Be the best therapist you can be for them, or else they'll think you're a bad friend and leave. Can't be the absolute best friend they could have? Start thinking about them, every second you're awake, every ounce of energy goes to making sure you won't be alone. I felt like a puppet and anxiety was pulling the strings, and yet somehow I couldn't see it was anxiety (?). Like I never had panic attacks or physical symptoms or racing thoughts. It was often masked as me improving myself, cause I use to be really shy and keep to myself, so a lot of the time I felt really alone and wondered why no one talked to me. To be honest, looking back I really felt like I was trying to be someone else, and the fact it actually worked and kept my friends when my original personality didn't reinforced the idea I had to do even better than before, and started trying to ""one-up"" myself. My obsession with being the ideal friend was I guess my way of taking control of the fact I was just really alone. It's one of the things I looked back on and wish I had tried improving my confidence instead of my social skills.

Eventually I couldn't keep up and got burnout, and started getting numb. It suddenly got increasingly harder and harder to keep up and one by one, I sort of pushed all my friends away. I still consider them my friends, cause I swear they're such good friends they forgive me every time I disappear, but I kind of wish they had better ones that weren't me. If I wasn't completely numb at the time I would have felt so much shame and guilt, cause I really broke their hearts by being the perfect friend they could wish for only to abandon them cause she got stupidly numb and demotivated out of nowhere.

Luckily I managed to get my emotional range back just last month! I don't know what happened to cause this, if it was time or me moving out of my bedroom for once or me finally doing my homework, but what matters is my numbness is slowly but surely getting better and better. Trying to keep being productive because I think that’s what opened the emotions but insomnia makes it a little hard.

I got suggested a chart about OCD today and was able to see my experiences with social anxiety in the definitions. Like I was so obsessive it honestly felt like I was being puppeted to be an ideal friend, but the anxiety really didn’t feel like anxiety because I never constantly felt panicky but rather like I was controlled and manipulated by my own insecurities and those insecurities just grew the more control I gave it. Actually the only other time that happened was my eating disorder, where I was basically living an illusion of control even when I knew it wasn’t real. I’m wondering if this experience was OCD or presented OCD-like traits (everything’s on a spectrum) or just regular social anxiety. I can’t diagnose myself but I really want to understand myself more and I guess this is a good place to start",Social anxiety or OCD?
OCD,"Could this be an obsession and if so how does it fit into the scheme of OCD? I was just recently diagnosed with OCD and hadn't thought of these things as possibly an OCD thing before. I often feel like people sound like pigs at the trough when they are eating, feel agitated and have to leave or put on headphones. If I am eating myself it doesn't bother me I think because my own chewing and stuff drowns it out. Loud music doesn't bother me as much as it used to, but if there's like loud bass coming from next door or a car on the street I used to have a full blown adrenalin rush, I'd get shaky my hands and feet would feel cold, I'd feel enraged, if I thought about going over to say something it would get even worse. I also have an ASD diagnosis so it could be that or something entirely separate. I do have to say it's unpleasant and unwanted and I find it difficult not to fixate on it.",Loud Music and Eating Noises
OCD,"I know I experienced little t trauma in my childhood, but my brain keeps telling me I experienced something acutely traumatic even though I'm very sure didn't.

Is this familiar to anyone else?",Obsessive thoughts about childhood trauma?
OCD,"Whenever I'm stressed, I just think I'm going to immediately kill myself. But it's not like a scary thing, it's a relieving thing. I try to explain it to people (therapists counselors etc) by saying it's like looking toward the emergency exit on a bus you don't want to be on and fantasying about jumping through it.

I'm not depressed! It's been a few years since I was depressed, and what happened was I did become suicidal and I felt this crazy, magical experience of utter peace and calm and freedom because I had decided literally nothing mattered, I was going to die, that homework was never getting done, it doesn't matter. I didn't kill myself of course, but ever since then, even since not being depressed, I think about killing myself probably once or twice per minute and have ever since that experience.

I try to read resources online and things like that, but all of it is centered on people who are scared of death and having obsessions that they're going to kill themselves. But for me, it's not that I *want* to kill myself, but I don't know... I guess I want to be back in that place and time where there was no stress and no future to care about. I'm still surprised now that I am alive. I hate how there's very little resources for suicide attempt survivors. I, on purpose, didn't tell anyone beforehand, and wanted to make it so if I failed I could just keep on going. I did fail, so I even went to school the very next day, told no one. I'm happy now, I have friends, girlfriend, accepted into uni, life on track, all that, nothing is bad, but I just still think ""I'm going to kill myself."" every time a youtube video buffers or I drop a cracker on the floor or I get a homework assignment or nick myself shaving, or do literally anything. It's basically my ""I don't care about that."" Instead of having any stress response, I just go ""Doesn't matter, because I'm going to commit suicide."" 

&amp;#x200B;

It only starts to worry me because it's turned into a sort of auto-blackmail situation. I don't want to face anything stressful because my brain just chants ""I'm going to kill myself"" as comfort. I'm always worried that one day I'm going to say it out loud and freak people out and get myself in trouble, ruin my life. And I don't like to talk about it with counselors and therapists for the same reason, I don't want them to misunderstand and get me in trouble by thinking I'm actually suicidal. But it's hard because the repeating, comforting thought ""I'm going to kill myself"" is basically my response to everything. When they ask why I didn't do something, I don't know what to say, because the truth is I didn't do it because if I tried I would have screamed I was going to kill myself. And of course that sounds like suicidality... 

I have actually explained all this stuff above to my therapist type people, but it seems like all of them want to steer me away from talk like that, after they make sure I'm not actually suicidal. One of them was pretty upfront that if I kept mentioning it, it wouldn't matter that I told him I wasn't actually suicidal, if I kept saying that I think about killing myself he would have to report it as a suicidal student. 

Dunno. Just ranting. Feel like no one gets it, and I don't know what to do about it.","Suicidal thinking isn't the obsession, it's the compulsion and it comforts me, and no one gets that"

OCD,"In other words, something that absolutely must go a certain way but a stranger interrupts the process, and you're unable to go back?

I'll give you an example, I'm extremely sensitive about certain purchases I make. They exterior packaging can be touched, but I start to short circuit a little when the contents/interior of what I've purchased is touched, for example, a mobile phone that gets activated in a store and requires an employee to unbox it and manipulate it in front of you.

I feel totally powerless to overcome the amount of anguish it gives me, not knowing where their hands have been, knowing I didn't get to tangibly connect with something first. Will I become emotionally detached from that object forever, because I never experienced the purchasing decision I had envisioned? Will it feel worthless to me, and will I feel like immediately selling it?

This causes massive inconveniences in my life. I'm a bit embarrassed to say I've actually returned and re-purchased things before until it goes my way. Simple purchases have taken me MONTHS to complete because of this. I can't stop thinking about the negative consequences of what'll occur if I don't get the perfect, intimate experience I had imagined before showing up at a store somewhere. It's the main reason I purchase nearly everything online. Unfortunately, with certain things, this isn't always possible.

How do YOU cope when something can't be completed the correct way because of what it requires someone else to unfairly do? I keep thinking to myself ""It's temporary anxiety. It'll calm down. I just need to remind myself that these thoughts are irrational."" But they ALWAYS return, and will keep me awake at night.

OCD,"Hey everyone , im writing cuz maybe if i see that other people have this sort of compulsion it might make me try to surpass it.

ever since i was a little kid (pre diagnosis) , i always was afraid that one of my family members dying , i'd go to my parents room &amp; my brothers' &amp; see if they are breathing , call them 200 times if they are out etc..

at the start of the year my mom had a seizure caused by a 10 year old stroke that affected her brain , thankfully she is doing good with meds etc.. , when it happened i barely called 911 &amp; straight passed out , woke up to my mom &amp; dad waking me up , it scarred me &amp; amped up my ocd to the highest level since 2015

it was like the thing i'm most scared of in life , even as a 10 year old i used to pray that i would die before them. (which can bring up another compulsion that i'm a selfish human being cuz of the pain it might cause them)


these days days i literally bother them 24/7 making them check sugar/blood pressure levels , checking their meds , if i hear someone speaking in a high voice , my heart starts pounding thinking something happened to them , the thing is usually the pain of my ocd is kept inside me whatever it is , but now i feel like i'm hurting them by monitoring every single thing they do.

for an example i'll keep checking on them if they took their meds , checked everything etc.. but they are getting tired of me , i'm stuck between wanting to help them &amp; not bother them or affect them badly.

specially with covid , i'm at uni &amp; graduating soon but it has been more than 3 months since i have seen my friends cuz im afraid i'll get covid &amp; pass it to my family , i even try as much as i can to prevent them from going out , and it bothers them 

so either i adhere to my compulsions to keep them ""safe"" , or stop and break down mentally &amp; live in constant fear.

OCD,"I’ve noticed that I have several symptoms of what could be OCD over the past year or two(?) but I do not think I had any when I was a child. Could this mean that this is something else entirely? I’ve questions myself as to whether or not these thoughts are real and I’m quite sure that I would not have been forcing these thoughts for the past year or two. I have been socially isolated from most of my friends and stuck at home with my family since last March. I’ve heard that this can make symptoms worse. I have also been taking a full load of online college classes since last September so I could just be really stressed. I’ll have periods of time where the symptoms are worse and it seems like it happens when I’m alone for most of the day doing school work. 

Some of the things that I do are counting certain things by threes and up to twelve such as petting my pets, making sure all main doors are locked each time I pass them, violent intrusive thoughts (I’ve never acted on them and I don’t think I will), tapping the doorways in my house with a certain number of fingers each time and having to restart if I fuck up, turning on and off my bathroom light switch in a way that makes sense, and pouring out a pink cup sitting on the edge of my bath tub each time I use the bathroom even if there is no water in it. One thing that has been bothering me a lot lately is checking the Snapchat snap map to see a certain friends location and then moving to another’s without seeing anyone else on the way. Sometimes I’ll spend a few minutes doing this and it bothers me a lot. I’ve heard thinking of your pet when you get intrusive thoughts helps you keep your mind off of them and it does help a little bit.

I got diagnosed with OCD in January at age 19. To give a brief backstory, I also am bipolar. When I was 10-15 I struggled deeply with cutting. It was always when I was in a depressive episode or super distressed about something. I’ve considered myself recovered for years now, I’ve only relapsed a handful of times (always when depressed). Fast forward to now. I’m on the right combo of meds for my bipolar and am very stable mood wise. I’m content in general. But in the past few months, the urge to cut has come back super strong. It is intense. The kicker is that it hasn’t at all been correlated with my moods, or even stress. Like I can just be happily going about my day and then get knocked out with the most powerful urge to hurt myself, and I get preoccupied with that. Could this be an OCD thing? 
I also have struggled with derm/trich on and off since I was a little kid and both of those are becoming obsessions again as well. I’m trying really hard not to pick or pull and it almost seems like my trying not to cut is similar.",Could my self harm urges be OCD?
OCD,"Not really a question but like here's the story and I could use some advice

I have a notebook, it's graph paper and at exactly half I started a, how should I call it? A list, a list of numbers, starting from 0000 and I'm going to get to 9999 eventually. It's in pen. It's very organized in rows and the back of the page lines up with the front and even if I wrote a wrong number it still looks nice after I write the correct number.

Anyway on February 12 I realized I duplicated a number and I would have to rip out 3 pages to correct the mistake and j was pissed that I would have to waste my work and just today, March 3rd I finally did it and got going on it again

I was showing my friend the numbers because I was happy to be doing it again and he said ""bro that's like textbook ocd behavior"" and I was like ""what? No, it not, it's just my ADHD and anxiety and this calms me"" and he was like ""no. You said you got mad when you messed up and blah blah blah. Yeah that's textbook ocd behavior"" and so I did a little research and noticed many other symptoms of ocd in myself 

 now I'm thinking my ADHD was actually not real and it's just OCD instead but I'm diagnosed with ADHD

and now I can't sleep because I need to know if I possibly have OCD and just add that to the list of shit wrong with me. Sorry for kinda rambling this just is bothering me now

My compulsions mostly manifest as tics. However, when I'm having sudden unhealthy thoughts (not sure if they're counted as intrusive) such as being useless, unworthy, a burden to everyone, too incompetent to keep my job, suicidal, etc. I tend to punch and slap myself because I feel like I deserve it and to lessen the intensity of the emotional pain I'm having, and most of the time I feel like those are the only things that drive those thoughts away. Like my motor tics, I also need the slaps and punches to be symmetrical, like if I do it on my right cheek, I have to do it on my left or else I'll feel a huge discomfort.


I'm not sure if this tendency of mine is a part of my OCD, or just a general symptom of my anxiety. Any insights would be appreciated.",Is self-harming a compulsion?
OCD,"
Before I begin my post, I do not condone the use of any illegal substances and am simply posting my experience and it’s regards to my OCD. Take from this what you will.

You may have read the title and saw the word “cured.” By that that I mean: absolutely rid any intrusive or unwanted sexual thoughts and my sexual attraction towards the opposite gender has, although not to the same extent as before, has returned. It is something I see as a miracle. But, a little bit of background is needed to understand my personal battle with HOCD.

When I was 15 years old, I viewed P daily. It was a horrible habit. It was also around this time where I fell into the alt-right pipeline and was fueled by unwarranted hate for the LGBT community. Anything 15 year old me saw as homosexual was disgusting. One day though, I was searching for P when I simply saw the thumbnail of a gay P video. As soon as I saw it, with the thoughts of my garbage political views, I immediately had intrusive and unwanted sexual thoughts. From that moment on my life changed.

I had your typical HOCD experience. Everyday was hell. I could no longer look at a man straight in the face and lost my sexual attraction towards girls. From the ages of 15-16.5, I fought a war in my head with HOCD. Slowly, my brain recovered to a point where my HOCD was “manageable” and didn’t affect my daily life as much. However, I still never recovered from the hell that was my younger teenage years. 

Starting in the second semester of my junior year of high school, I began to smoke marijuana. I also wasn’t an alt-right shithead anymore and was friends with people from all aspects of life. The marijuana use in the beginning minimally helped my HOCD, but it wasn’t anything useful. I still had unwanted and intrusive thoughts about my sexuality that really affected me. Nevertheless, I delved deeper into the stoner community for a couple of reasons but one of the main ones being looking for any help for my HOCD. If you do not want to see a doctor, I can completely understand as I did not want to see one myself.

As I was exploring marijuana, I began to immerse myself into the realm of psychedelics. I read upon its beautiful effects on the mind and read for hours a day on people whose psychedelic experience massively helped their mental battles. This started when I began my freshman year of college. It was in December of 2020 when I was ready to have my own psychedelic experience.

It started off with a bag of magic mushrooms by the lake with my two good friends who are brothers. We brought two blankets so that we could lay on the sand. I ate the mushrooms around 10 AM that day and waited. As I was waiting though and about 30 minutes after I consumed the substance, I layed down on the blankets with my two friends. Immediately the worst anxiety, intrusive, and unwanted sexual thoughts began because I was laying down to two people of the opposite gender. For what seemed like 10 minutes (psychedelics alter your perception of time so this seemed like 10 normal minutes), I was in the most hellish part of my mind that I had ever been in. I thought I was about to have a nightmare psychedelic experience. But, I was completely wrong.

After those 10 minutes, the psychedelic realm took hold over my brain and reality itself. For the first time in 4 years in my battle with HOCD, I saw how life was without it. I couldn’t act upon any of my reassurances and when I looked at my two friends, I no longer had those intrusive and wanted sexual thoughts. It was at this moment when I stood up and for the first time in years, had thoughts that were “normal.” For the next 4-5 hours, I had a mushroom experience that really focused on myself. It was life-changing. 

For the past 3 months, I have had absolutely no HOCD thoughts. I’ve even returned some of my sexual attraction towards the opposite gender. I also had lots of other life changes that have extremely benefitted me such as stopping chewing my nails and even doing wayyyy better in school. I cried during the trip because of how beautiful it was and, from that moment on, I knew my life was going to change. 

Once again, I do not condone the use of any substances. I am simply discussing my experience with HOCD and how psilocybin mushrooms cured it. I will answer any questions you guys have and I want you all to know that you are loved :)",Magic Mushroom Experience Cured My HOCD (I DO NOT CONDONE THE USE OF ILLEGAL SUBSTANCES)
OCD,"Hello.

I was wondering if there are people here who got through ocd by simply not giving in to the anxiety.
Instead of going through the process of ERP step by step, I thought of doing the ""Grand Anxiety Month"", not giving in to the anxiety, no compulsions.

My therapist said there's a great chance of relapsing and even worsen my symptoms. But I'm curious, could the Grand Anxiety Month actually be a thing?","Curing OCD, the hard way."

OCD,"I would like to start by saying I do not have an eating disorder, it is purely an OCD related obsession that leads me to have a very ritualistic way of eating and managing my food. 

One of my obsessions is schedule and time, I like to do the same things at the same times every single day. This goes for all things, but it is my food that I'm getting concerned about. 

I like to eat the same things every day, 6 days per week. I know this isn't healthy because the best diet is an inclusive and varying diet. 

I guess I'm looking for some advice. What are some foods you would recommend me add to my diet daily? I'm working on changing it up, but for the days I can't, I'm trying to have it be as healthy as possible. 

I eat oatmeal with protein powder, goji berries, pumpkin seeds, and either hemp seeds or ground linseeds for lunch, and at dinner, I always have brown lentils and split peas cooked in spices &amp; vegetable broth, with some canned tomatoes and lots of spinach, topped with cottage cheese. 

On top of this I eat the same brand of protein bar every day to make sure I'm hitting enough calories. Sometimes I have a sweet potato or a hard-boiled egg after I get home from work, sometimes I add in cucumber or fresh sliced tomato. 

The way I eat is a huge compulsion and ritual for me. Every Friday, I ""meal prep"" my oatmeal and lentils in little labelled containers. I think it would be really easy to add different (dried) things to my oats. Do you guys have any suggestions?


It's very difficult for me to add in ""fresh"" foods, i only really have spinach and tomatoes for my veggies, and the dried berries. Are there any dried or powdered things I can add to my ritualistic meal organization containers that might help me maintain better health?

I already take a multi vitamin, B12, and Iron+Vitamin C

OCD,"Hi its 6 am where I live. Yes I am going to sleep now. How hard can going to sleep be. I chanced my underwear, pants and shirt. Then I chanced shirt again. Washed my hands probably 5-10 times (depend how you count it). Even after this I am afraid  about that wet spot on my leg when I was chancing my pants. It was probably water form my hands because I could not dry them fully because my towel is never dry. Still I fear that was pee. I may be askin reassurance ( Im sorry).

OCD,"Hey everyone, so one of my compulsions is to research everything I'm going through, I'm kind of a perfectionist about it (I feel like I have to do 4 resources for each topic; 2 articles &amp; 2 videos usually 1hr &amp; notes have to be written in a grid format). I use to be able to discard the notes after &amp; just keep a summary but whenever I was going through that topic again, even tho I knew the answer, I'd feel like I have to research it all over again for ""proof"" of my summary... 

So in the past few weeks I decided to keep my notes so I don't have to re-research, but now I can't stop researching everything, I did like 50 topics in the past few weeks... Is this crazy? Should I just get rid of my notes, keep a summary &amp; if a topic comes up that I already know the answer to, resist researching again, try to reassure myself in other ways?",Research OCD Advice?
OCD,"one of the things that i obsess over is whether or not i have certain diagnoses that my therapist hasn't pointed out to me, and i get worried that i'm not getting the right treatment for it. whenever i do this, i fixate a lot on my behavior to see if it falls into a category of a diagnosis, or i'll take online tests to gauge whether or not i have those disorders. i keep going back to bipolar, bpd, autism, or ppd. i know, intellectually, that my therapist would have told me if i had these traits, but i still get paranoid that she's lying to me or is missing something.

does anyone else experience this? how do you deal with it?",obsessing over mental health diagnoses?
OCD,"Let me start by saying that my brain isn't a happy one. I was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder, Dependent Personality Disorder and Anxiety last year, and I strongly suspect that I have ADHD (I'm booked for an assessment, but it's not till April). But there are still some things that I do that just can't figure out.

So onto the thing. I've been doing it as long as I can remember. Sometimes it's the sounds or words that people say around me. Mostly it's tv shows, movies, songs. If I see/hear something that vaguely relates to a quote, I'll say the quote, or I'll modify the quote so it fits with the cue.

Eg, today I saw a sign that said ""Smashed avocado."" My brain went immediately to a scene from the Simpsons, wherein Homer is wearing a hat that has a camera in it. He smashes the hat and runs off, and the camera in the hat captures Apu dropping and picking up a hot dog. The scene ends with Apu saying, ""This is just between you and me, smashed hat.""

So I immediately blurt out, ""This is just between you and me, smashed avocado!""  I honestly can't control it, I can't stop myself from doing it because it happens without me even realising until it's done. It's not just the one tv show, it's literally every thing that I've ever watched. I think most of what comes out of my mouth is just a quote from something else. The only time that I don't do this is when I'm in a therapy session, and maybe that's just because I feel safe to say what's on my mind?

I just... I can't place where this tic comes from. It's definitely not autism. I don't have any of the traits (I'm female) that girls typically display with autism. Never did as a child, definitely don't as an adult.

I'm also very perfectionist about it, whenever I research there has to be 2 articles &amp; 2 videos for every topic, is this ridiculous?

OCD,"I have searched this sub and looked online, but I can't find anyone with a similar obsession.

If I lose an item of clothing I cannot rest until I have found it. This is particularly a concern to me if the missing item is part of a pair or set, such as a sock.

This is also part of another general obsession over losing my possessions. A single lost item will have me turning the house upside down and checking the bin, and I am anxious until the item is found.

Yesterday I spent ages looking for a prepaid debit card that I knew had no money left on it. Today I tipped my handbag out and lifted up all the sofa cushions to find a cheap biro, because it's part of a matching set of 3.

There is another part to this obsession whereby sometimes I can't sleep for asking myself questions about clothes I used to own. Do I still own that top or did I give it to the charity shop? What happened to those trainers I used to wear all the time?

OCD,"School is probably one of the worst places for someone with COCD.

(I'm in Aukland, New Zealand. So we're currently in a short lockdown rn, but just wanted to share how I deal with school)

I go to a shitty public high-school, where I try to avoid touching all surfaces if possible. I've been studying there for 3 years, and I really can't trust other students. I use paper towels or my sleeves to pick up or hold things, I don't care if I get stared at, it makes me comfortable to do it. So every door handle or pen I use, I would have a barrier between it and my skin. I would have my hood up so that it covers my hair from germ particles in the air. I do all this even knowing I will shower everyday after school. 

This gets to the point where I'm afraid of giving my friends hugs, or other friendly gestures. Or let them borrow stationary and whatnot. It makes me feel terrible, knowing all the others are having fun, playing sport, bare feet, and not afraid to share stuff. Whereas I cannot, I could only chat and observe them from a distance. This covid-19 thing isn't helping either. Having this nagging fear and discomfort, I really don't enjoy school as much anymore.

I refuse to drink water for 6 hours until I get home, so that I would not need to use school bathrooms. I cannot stand the imagery of urine and faeces and whatnot. Sometimes, though, when I have my period, I just need to go. When I do go, I would take forever in the bathroom to do my business. I doubt the cleanliness of the bathrooms (or for all the establishments in general). I would use up a tremendous amount of TP; to cover up toilet seat, to barrier my hands, to wipe. I'm a hoverer. But if my bum touches the toilet seat, or liquid rebounds from the bowl, I would internally cry and become uncomfortable for the rest of the day. I've long stopped giving a shit about others in the bathroom, only knowing to distance myself from them. For washing hands, I would use soap and water and wash for at least 6 times before I'm satisfied. Sometimes the water rebounds from the sink and onto my underarms, and I would re-wash. Sometimes my wrist touches the edge of the sink, and I would wash that entire arm. I  hate have using public facilities like this, I do not trust them. After washing, what's next? I then wait for someone to open the bathroom door for me. 

Being paranoid about even the most minute problems makes me unfocused on school work. Going to school, all my thoughts would consist of only contamination and avoiding it. I could've be using my brain power to study, but instead I'm focused on irrational fears about contamination. 

Basically, after 3 years there, I have long since made calculations and developed this stupid routine.  I am kind of glad on the other hand. Because going to school means I wouldn't waste water at home (yeah ik it sounds bad). 

I also want to know about others experiencing similar things at school. What do you do at school? How do you feel? Any tips to share?",COCD | Fear of contamination at school
OCD,"I don't even know where to start with this. I've had POCD going on 6 years now and it has been nothing short of hell. Its improving and this is where the real problem lies. The things that I believe/believed led me to have some very strange and bizarre behaviour that people began to draw their conclusions. Rumours were started about me and it hasn't been good at all. It's like all of my worst fears became a reality. Now I'm at a place where I feel like I just need to muster up some courage to just kill myself. It didn't feel real before but it feels real now and it's preferable to be dead then for everyone seeing you as some sort of potential sex offender or something. I honestly wish I had never been born it would have been one less person with this awful experience. I'm not asking for pick me ups but more if there has been anyone who's been through something similar although I doubt it because I dont think POCD changes a lot of your behaviours. Either way it's worth a shot.

Thank you",Better to be gone.
OCD,"TW: POCD, real event OCD, suicide, self harm

I have severe real event OCD, at least I think I do. or maybe what I did was actually so bad that I deserve to feel terrified and guilty all the time. I honestly can't tell.

the memory that is haunting me is that a year ago when I was 15 I used to do cringe roleplays with strangers online. not sexual roleplays but mostly ones that were angsty and tragic and shit. I know it's cringe but if the cringeyness was the worst part I'd be okay rn.

in a lot of the roleplays I'd roleplay a character who was in a relationship with the other character. never anything explicitly sexual but I made one kind of sexual joke, and there was romance like the characters kissed and flirted and stuff.

the problem is I did a roleplay with someone who was probably 12 or 13 when I was 15. I never had any interest in the other person, I just liked role-playing for fun. the other person had a boyfriend at the time and we both understood that it was just role-playing and neither of us liked eachother.

but I was already suffering from severe real event ocd to the point where I couldn't eat or sleep because I spent all day ruminating and panicking. this memory only flared it up again but worse. 

now my mind has convinced me this makes me a child groomer and a pedophile. not only that, but it has me fully convinced I'm going to get called out and exposed to the entire internet, and have my entire life ruined and have everyone think I'm a predator forever, and that maybe I'll even go to jail.

I can't keep living like this, the fear is too strong. I don't know what to do and nobody listens, they just tell me to get over it. but I feel like I ruined my entire life, like my family and friends are all going to find out and I'll be labeled as a pedophile forever.

I promise I didn't mean to do anything and I'm really not attracted to people younger than me but I feel like I have to kill myself because my life will never be normal again and I'm a bad person so I don't even deserve a normal life. I hate myself so much. why do I fuck up so much.

OCD,"Do some people have compulsions that are so hard to get right? (for example I have to have a good thought for every aspect of the next action or task. This can mean I have to have good thoughts like 20 times in a row, else I need to start over. It's not like doing something 20 times till you do it with a good thought once)

For me this means I can be stuck in a loop for days, weeks, ... Because I just can't get it right, I just can't have the tought I want for every aspect of the action.

I think this can also happen with actions where you just need to have one good thought with I guess and where it just doesn't keep working out, even if you try 50 times. This can like literally make me cry of how impossible it seems.

These are the worst cause they are stuck in your head forever, you keep thinking about the steps you still have to take and the good thoughts you still need to have with them and you will probably fail (cause who is able to not think about the pink elephant 20 times in a row) and start over again and again and again.

OCD,"One of my biggest struggles with my OCD is perfectionism. Whenever I want to learn something new or complete a task, if I make one small mistake it makes me want or start all over or just give up in general.

I was first really motivated to start, but then quickly started to compare myself to other artists who have been drawing for years on end and felt really bad if I made mistakes while learning.

At the fall of 2016 I realized I was attracted to guys or maybe not. There was this arousal and butterflies in stomach whenever I used to see my crush walk by the college hall but it soon lead to an obsession.
It all felt cute and lovely until the butterflies in stomach got replace by panic attacks and anxiety with arousal.
I was stuck in this loop of getting aroused by the feelings. 
While that obsession lead the guy to creep out and him ignoring me for rest of our life. Fast forward today he becomes the ideal image of the guy whom am I attracted too.

OCD,"I have my regular appointment with my psychiatrist coming up in two months because I'm already diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety, and depression. After reading about OCD over the last few days and talking with a friend who is diagnosed with it, I'm thinking there is a strong possibility I also have it, so I am planning on asking my psychiatrist about it. 

I have a few questions for people who have gone through this before:

* What should I prepare? I assume I should make a list of symptoms, but should I try to be specific about it/what level of specificity?
* One problem that I've realized is that while I've been aware that I have had intrusive thoughts for years, I think I only was recognizing certain specific intrusive thoughts (like ones about self-harm/violent things) and that all this time I think I've had way more intrusive thoughts that I just didn't realize were intrusive? And because I didn't recognize them for what they are and have assumed that they are normal, my ADHD memory just sorta tossed my recollection of a lot of them bc they weren't relevant so I'm sitting here trying so hard to search my mind for memories of times I've been affected by intrusive thoughts but that's hard when I don't exactly know what I'm looking for, if that makes sense? Like for example, (TW for talking about specific intrusive thought) sometimes when I hear/see something out of the ordinary I will latch onto specific descriptions of who I am with, what is around me, license plate numbers, the time, etc in case there is a crime happening and the police end up questioning me. I didn't realize that this was an intrusive thought/could be an OCD thing until I was talking with my friend who has OCD who does the same thing. What are maybe some examples of intrusive thoughts/checking that aren't as commonly known about that could help me jog my memory?
* For people who have gotten diagnosed during covid over video calls, what was your experience like? I've only ever been diagnosed with stuff when I was at in-person appointments and I'm curious about how it could possibly go. 
* I guess I'd just like to hear what people have to say in general about their experience getting diagnosed!

OCD,"i am always trying to be an ally for the lgbt+ community and for people of color. i keep having intrusive thoughts come into my head that are things such as “what if you are racist?” or something of the sort. this leads to me actually thinking thoughts that are racist or homophobic. i know that i don’t actually believe those things but i still feel horrible about it and i’m in fear that i do believe those things. i’m also constantly worried and obsessing about my past and the times where i was unknowingly racist or homophobic. i know there’s nothing i can do about the past but i practically feel like i’m dying just thinking about it. this has been happening all day everyday. if this happens to anyone else, what do you do about it?","does anyone else have constant obsessions about racism/homophobia? if so, then how do you deal with it?"
OCD,"(TRIGGER WARNING)

Sorry, I'm new to all this, but I'm kinda going through allot right now. 

SO... over the past 2 months or so, seemingly out of nowhere, I started dealing with some pretty severe anxiety/panic attacks, only to later find out after so much research, that I am suffering from different forms of OCD, and have been throughout my life. However, it was never this bad, and when I was oblivious as to what OCD really was, I never really had any of these anxiety attacks, or severe obsessions. Or at least not as bad as they are now.

Basically, the core root of my problems, is the intense fear of going insane, constantly questioning my minds ability to develop a severe mental illness such as schizophrenia, dementia, or borderline personality disorder, psychosis, ext ext, and my intrusive thoughts have been latching onto these fears recently.

Now, what made things **INFINITELY** worse. I started searching for celebrities and noteworthy people who also suffer/suffered from OCD. I found a page that went through a bunch of different people who suffered from this cursed disease, and with that, I actually found so much solace and relief. Think Darwin, DiCaprio, Howard Hughes, ext. ext. 

Unfortunately, that solace quickly turned into severe distress as I neared the bottom of the list. The background and information on two particular individuals are the sole cause of the ""harm OCD"" im suffering from. It listed the Sandy Hook shooter and the dark knight move theater shooter as people who suffered from anxiety and OCD that progressively got much worse throughout their lives. Naturally, like a moron, I did a deep dive on the background of these two individuals, because ur brain wants to know **""just how bad can OCD and anxiety get?""**. As such, I became horrified. Now obviously, these two had some SERIOUS mental issues and their horrendous actions probably weren't solely caused by anxiety and OCD, but the fact that they also suffered from anxiety and OCD was enough for my brain to become fixated and terrified. ""Here are two individuals with anxiety and OCD, one of whom was apparently easygoing and even graduated college, that lost total control and did the most horrific things the human mind can imagine.""

Im 1000% positive that if I hadn't read about these two, I would NOT be suffering like I am now. This ""Harm OCD"" all started simply after reading about them, and was not even a problem until now. Im guessing my intrusive thoughts just latched onto these fears....?

I believe it causes me severe distress because I, as a person, am overly compassionate and deeply care about other people. I will go out of my way to help a stranger in any way that I can, so, maybe im having this harm OCD because the intrusive thoughts are completely antithetical and contradictory to who I am as a person.

 I even want to become a police officer solely due to the fact that it is a profession where I can potentially make a difference in someones life, or save someone. But, at the same time, throughout my life and even today, I did always have a fascination with wars/combat, and my brain tries to look for any similarities like that...... and it sucks... allot. I even made a pact with myself to take my own life if it ever got so bad, just so I wouldn't be able to hurt anyone. I don't know what to do,","If I didn't have access to the internet, I would be much better........."
OCD,"You don’t even FIND these people attractive , not a pedo , but groinals go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr",Is anyone hyper aroused by everything ?
OCD,"I've finally getting my life back together again after months of my ocd being really bad to the point where it convinced me that I was something I was not it made me feel worthless to the point where I believed I didn't deserve anything I've made some mistakes in my life which I really regret but I've finally started putting in the effort to put my life back on track. 

OCD made me believe that what I had done was the worst thing on earth and that I can't be friends with people or get a relationship and this feeling paralyzed me it went on over and over in my head it beat me down and wouldn't let go of me. ""yours is different"" ""your horrible and cant be loved"" ""you cant be a teacher"" ""what if people were to find out your whole life will be ruined no one would ever speak to you"" You would lose everyone"" These thoughts haunted me every day for months and I'm sure they have for a lot of people here as well

I was in a really bad spot for the past couple of months the lowest of the low my sexual themed obsession had become so bad it convinced me completely that I was what I was not it sent me into a panic and depressive state to the point where i could not function anymore. 

I have a porn addiction and I've watched things that have really fucked me over with my ocd I may have not realised it at the time but I was setting myself up for the worst year of my life 2020 and most of 2021 have been the worst years of my life its amazing how mental health form good to not able to function. And how quickly an addiction can deteriorate especially a porn addiction. 

My experience has been hard but I still haven't lost not yet but I think I've finally hit a turning point. I have started to exercise eat well and meditate more I mean I've even asked a girl out on a date and she said yes.

It's not over yet and there are hard days ahead but I promise I will beat this stupid Illness it shall not rule my life anymore not now.",I finally said enough is enough
OCD,I did something stupid and insensitive and inappropriate last year and I knew better!! I knew I shouldn’t have done it! But I did and now I’m paying the price by agonizing over it every waking minute. Previous experiences with real event ocd always involved me doing something accidentally or when I was much younger but this is something I did when I was old enough to know better and I still fucked up. I hate myself and I don’t know how I’m going to live with this.,I fucked up
OCD,"Every time I see/hear something that I think will trigger an intrusive thought, I have to tug my hair three times. Each tug must hurt or else I don’t think the compulsion will “work.”

I also have to fall asleep with a strand of hair in my hands just in case an intrusive thought tries to bite.

I was just wondering if this was just a me thing or if someone else has experienced a similar compulsion?
Or if this is even a compulsion? It would make a lot of sense if it was. 

Thanks",does anyone else have this compulsion or something similar?
OCD,"I have a phobia of sexually abusing underage kids . Like checking someone out but then they’re underage . I’m a grade 11, and occasionally I find grade 10s cute , or sometimes I reminisce over past crushes form grade 10 who I may not have seen often this year . I am HORRIFIED that this is sexual abuse . Like I try not to find grade 10s cute anymore because I’m 17 now and they are often around 15-16 . I am also more attracted to developed faces , than someone with childlike features . Cuz I read hat if there’s a 3 year age gap between you and someone you like it’s sexual abuse to check
Them out or look st them for sexual pleasure .
And they’re right , I wouldn’t look at
Someone who’s 14 . But I had this one friend who was 14 for two months in grade 10. So what if I’m attracted to a 14 year old ?
Ugh",Anyone dealt with this fear ? Fear of sexually abusing underage people ?
OCD,I’m at McDonald’s with my family and I saw a girl who was bigger than me and had a hoodie. I got the urge to talk to her and ask fo her age but I didn’t because I’m trying to accept the uncertainty. It’s making me feel like I’m attracted to her when I don’t want to be attracted to any girl underage. And I don’t even know her age which makes it so much more worse. To make matters even worse I’m trying to fantasize about a different actress than in the movie I’m watching and I’m getting intrusive thoughts about Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee’s character who was 17 in the show but 22-23 in real life). I don’t want to be attracted to 17 year olds or any other girls underage ffs. I’m 19. I want girls that are my age or older. I don’t even want to date 18 year olds. I just want a girl my age or older ffs.,POCD uncertainty is so difficult
OCD,if you're going through it right now please keep your chin up you'll feel better soon. you are loved and you're worth it.,it gets better. :)
OCD,"Idk where to begin. I’m having terrible guilt of past mistakes and memories and it feels like OCD is twisting memories and making them different or telling me I did things I didn’t, either that or I can’t accept that I am a terrible person. I never dealt with POCD really, little bouts here and there but I was always able to push through them because I had far worse Contamination Worries at hand. This started a few nights ago. I’m 16M. I was watching a movie with my family and there was a little girl who popped up on screen who I thought was cute. But cute in like a little kid way, but then my brain said I thought much more of a little little girl. I then began to worry and then a memory from a few months ago popped up that i don’t even know if it happened or not. Last year I was around my little sister and her friend who was probably 12-13 and I remember her friend was cute in like a little sister way, but my brain is telling me I thought way more of her, and masturbated to thoughts of her and it is driving me crazy. I don’t think I ever did that, but my brain is telling me I just can’t accept that I did that. I don’t feel like I deserve to live if I actually did this. I don’t want to be a fucking pedophile, I just want a normal life and a normal family but I feel like I don’t deserve it. I remember googling back then when I began to think there was more to it if thinking a 13 year old was cute was bad. But that just drove me more crazy. I don’t even know what to do anymore. Please help I don’t have anywhere else to go.",Am I really a pedophile?
OCD,"TL;DR: Going through a mental breakdown and my OCD is almost gone. Kinda wanna embrace this and use it as a cheat start, but at the same time I'm scared about changing something that I've had for 13 years. Feeling very lost and confused. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*I kinda got carried away and realized this shit is way too long, so the first like 10 paragraphs are some backstory if you care, the important info is the **last 4 paragraphs**.

&amp;#x200B;

Think this is gonna be a huge rant post...

So for the past 2 weeks I feel like I've have just been mentally pushed beyond my limits. I became obsessively ""in love"" with this random Tinder girl that I've never met, I finally got the opportunity to move out and get a job, and my brother has been harassing me pretty much non stop for the past 2 weeks and no one does anything about. Being the older of 2 kids guess I'm the only one that causes shit and he's their little angel.

If I annoy him its my fault for being annoying, if he annoys me and I retaliate its my fault for hurting him...

And then I got this huge crush on someone I saw on Tinder. No idea why but suddenly suddenly she's the only girl for me. I understand this is just infatuation and I'm giving her the personality that I want and its all a fantasy, still fucks my brain though. This happens usually once or twice a year.

And the cherry on top is that my friends are getting an apartment 2 hours from where we live and they're inviting me, but I have to get a job. I'm 21, never had a job and never lived away from home because of anxiety or just laziness idk. I basically have no motivation and am a severe procrastinator so I feel like if I don't take this offer to force me away from home and into a job, I truly don't know when I will get another chance.

Now here's where the OCD comes in. I have struggled with intrusive thoughts for like 13 years now. I am a serial thought/memory note taker. Pretty much all of 2020 I spent my days on the PC and at any given moment I would just alt tab to a word doc and write my thoughts down. Over 8-12 months I have saved about 7-8 Word docs with about 2 thousand pages each. So I'm sitting on give or take 16 thousand pages of thoughts, ideas, dreams, memories, fantasies, etc.

I get thoughts that like I'm cursing people or wishing for bad shit for them to happen to them, sometimes with the thing happening in a few months or years and I spend years thinking about it and keeping that thought on my mind all the time. Like in 8th grade I thought I was gonna be dead or mentally disabled by the time I graduate high school and so for 4 years that thought had a pretty big priority in my memory storage.

Anyways, I finally snapped 2 days ago and went full rage mode. At this point I was at the ""heart break"" stage of my obsessive crush and just spent all day in my room listening music, while my brother kept walking in every hour and just fortnight dancing or like saying stupid shit to me and making faces.

At this point I kinda went into a blind rage. He ran away and tried closing the door behind him but I slammed into it so hard that I'm sure the door almost like folded over, and after that initial burst I just turned around and went to lay in my bed. I truly have only had like 5 ""blind rages"" in my life, and I've never hurt people. Off the top of my head, I once punched a hole in a wall, I did one of those like headbutt flinches at someone that beat me in 4 square during elementary school, I had a huge verbal argument with my dad but turned away before anything went too far, and then this event. Most of the time I learn to just back away before it gets to that point, but being as these 2 weeks were just pushing and squeezing me I couldn't control myself.

&amp;#x200B;

\***Main point of the post**

But yeah, then I laid in bed being all mad at myself for my emotional state, my crippling need to write every waking thought, my pathetic obsessive crushes, my pathetic sad life of just sitting at the pc browsing YouTube and reddit pretty much since I barely got out of college, and how I can't move out and become a somewhat independent adult with this current mindset. 

Now for the past 2 days since that rage and serious mental talk with myself I am in this numb, mental breakdown state. I feel lost and empty, but that also means that I also don't feel as compulsed to write down my thoughts.

Now on one side I really wanna try and take advantage of this. Fuck off with my thoughts and realize that sometimes I won't remember everything and thats fine. But another part of me is worried that this feels too easy. Right now I've only had like 10% of my normal intrusive thought, on one side I feel like if I can take advantage and really just accept this I would be able to get over it. But on the other hand it scares me that something I have been doing for 13 years can suddenly go away in 2 days? I'm worried that I mentally broke something permanently... 

I want to work on myself, but right now it feels way too easy to the point where I feel like I've just become a different person. I almost wanna go back to writing my thoughts just to feel 'normal' again. Idk what to do. And I have had mental breakdowns before and have been in this same spot, but for some reason im still scared. I want to be better but im scared of such a sudden and drastic change?",Does anyone else get these short episodes where they feel like they suddenly have the strength to beat their OCD?
OCD,"My cousin is in a situation Im trying to understand. She and I both have OCD. I don’t have relationship OCD though. She admitted to me this morning that, for her entire 4.5 year relationship with her boyfriend, it has been open. She has never pursued anything else but the guy she is dating may have (she’s asked him not to tell her if he does anything). Every time he brings it up to her her relationship OCD gets triggered. He seems very confused that she has no interest in pursuing other people. I’m not going to tell her to get out of the relationship (probably wouldn’t do any good anyways). On one hand maybe this is helping her face her triggers head on, or maybe this is just too much. Would love to know what people with relationship OCD think.","People with relationship OCD, what is your opinion about dating someone who wants an open relationship if you had no interest in that? Would that mess with your OCD?"
OCD,"I just can’t believe it! I never thought things were going to get better.

My other scores have come down too

Depression-extreme to NORMAL
stress-severe to NORMAL

I had been depressed for 10+ years. 
This is new territory. 

Find someone that is experienced with treating OCD and try ERP!!!!! It can and will get better. I fucking promise you. I’ve been so damn low that I know if I am able to get better that you can too.",3 months of ERP and OCD scores went from a 50 to a 13!
OCD,. I recently learned that a family died because they sprayed water on rodent poison and it made a poisonous gas. I then remembered that my dad stupidly put mouse poison down in the sink and i washed water down there. This alarmed me. I have 2 little sisters i love dearly. I told my parents but they could care less. I went upstairs to my room. My sisters later came to my room i told then to leave because i have this fear im going to sexually assault them . It one of my OCD thoughts. Well in my mind i was just basically trying to kill them because i told them to leave my room because the gas could be downstairs. When i realized this i started getting worried.i felt guilty that i was upstairs and away from the gas and they were down stairs closer to the sink because i told them to leave my room. I went downstairs and it took me maybe 5 mins to tell them they could come to my room they both said they didn't want too. I spent maybe 30 mins searching the internet to see if there was possibly toxic gas from the water and poison mixture. I learned that to have the poisonis gas made u need a specific ingredient and it wasnt in the poison we had. To sum it up i was just overreacting and there was no poisonous gas made which was good. But i feel like nothing because i basically risked my sisters life over dumb thoughts. I feel like i attempted murder. I honestly dont feel like living anymore. This may seem a bit extreme to others on why im worry so much. I dont know to be honest.,Guilt about possible poison
OCD,I definitely have ocd in other themes but i was looking at pictures or cute kittens and at first i said awwwww but then it was like my mind started fantasizing about hurting them. It felt like I had genuine enjoyment from the thoughts. Idk if im feeling anxious or not bc im on zoloft but I'm definitely obsessing over this so idk. It feels to real,Is this ocd?
OCD,"I hated when teachers said this in school. Like “some people misbehaved. You know who you are.”

Because I didn’t know if it was me. I wouldn’t think it was but they wouldn’t just say, and since I wasn’t sure I was well behaved, I thought it was me. 

The other one I hate is “if you have to ask, don’t do it.” I feel like I have to ask about everything. 

And also “don’t even think about it.” When people say that I’m automatically thinking about it!",Does anyone else hate expressions like “you know who you are?”
OCD,"Ugh, it’s from being locked up inside for practically a year, pent up anger and frustration, ruined career plans and social life, civil unrest literally in my neighborhood and stupid violent Netflix shows, but I’ve only discovered this year that I have OCD and ugghh!!!!

I don’t know how to do ERP on the current obsession (and the obsessions change every couple weeks) which is I’m afraid my parents, who are the only people I’ve seen for a year, are false people as in maybe they’re robots or are re-set characters like in a video game. I blame it on watching shows like Black Mirror, put all these ideas into my head, especially during the tense, early months of the pandemic. I could of also been a little delirious that time because I thought it would be a great time to lose weight so I severely restricted my diet to like 4 oranges a day and lost 20 lbs, but I don’t know if they had any negative effect on me. I gained the weight back though :/

I’m afraid that every time I get near my parents or have an angry thought against them that maybe harm would come to them. Maybe I’d black out and not remember. I will say being alone in my thoughts for a very long period of time has made me remember a lot of things in the past year and has pissed me off that my parents always prevented me from doing certain things which hindered my career and I’m pretty pissed about that. And also I’m afraid of losing them cause they’re all I have and the pandemic has put us on edge. I’ve avoided all people during the pandemic solely because of them, not for me, because I’m more worried for them than me.

Ugh, even the slightest bit of being mean to my
parents like telling them to get out of the way so I can get to the fridge is triggering me, afraid I’ve harmed them or something. I’ve resorted to taking short videos of them after incidents to make sure I’m not dreaming and they’re actually there lol.

At least I know it’s not just me lol. I have a friend who is so paranoid of her roommate now that she keeps her door locked lol, and I don’t think she has OCD.

It’s hard to go take a walk outside because of OCD, I’m basically afraid of everything now and there’s always cars zipping by alley ways that aren’t visible and I don’t want to get by a car, which according to Citizen app, is happening quite frequently in the area. Like, I’d be walking in my neighborhood and all of a sudden a car would zip right in front of me from an alley and there’s no way for me to see it coming. Happens so many times.

Also, it’s so inconvenient to go out cause then I’ll have to put on a mask and risk it since the new corona variants are floating around and then I have to take a shower to disinfect. Just easier to stay home than deal with all the hassle.

And to top it all off, I also have magical thinking OCD, constantly washing my hands thinking back dthoights can transfer onto objects.","Combination Harm, Existential and False Memory OCD"
OCD,"Would it be considered a compulsion to come out as the gender that your mind is obsessing over + how real does it feel to you when you do.

I’m in an odd place as a trans person with potentially Cis OCD because it feels like more so than with a Cis person with TOCD there’s the possibility that my OCD is correct. I’m currently on Testosterone and I adored all the changes I was getting however OCD has really attacked this as well as my identity and that I won’t be happy till I try living as a girl/getting off testosterone and I just really don’t know what to do. It’s become so difficult to take my testosterone as I don’t want to hold off re-feminizing if that’s what’s actually correct for me. It’s been going non stop for four months straight all day every day and I’m just exhausted and at this point ready to try and live as a girl just to make it stop but I’m worried this is also a compulsion.",TOCD how many times have you come out to yourself?
OCD,"I have had OCD since I was a kid but didnt speak up about it until a few years after the first symptoms, which made it worse until I started seeing a psychiatrist after telling my family. Things seem to be getting better ocd wise (ups and downs)but i have been feeling so numb and detached lately. I never felt depressed even when things were wayyy worse OCD wise(hours of compulsions and so much anxiety) but now for some reason i feel so disconnected from everything. It feels like I dont know who I really am without OCD controlling my life sometimes(even though i totally hate it) and i feel so weird about the past and present. I go out and stay very active and act hyper when im with my friends all the time but deep down im exhausted and when i get home i lay in bed and its like i just float into nothingness for hours. I also feel like turning into drugs to ease the feeling... which I did a couple if times.
Anyone can relate?",Depression for the first time after years of OCD?
OCD,this has been going on for years and i honestly don’t know what to do. the thoughts don’t stop and they keep getting worse and worse. everyday i think about how terrible of a person i am no matter how much i try and fight the thought. the longer this goes on the more i get used to it and the easier it gets and i hate myself for that. help me,"i know for a fact i have pocd, what the duck do i do??"
OCD,"Hello, so 9 months ago I was at an outdoorsparty and got too drunk and blacked out (for ~2hours). I remember the ending of the party and me getting home. The day after I asked my friends if I had done something stupid, and they all said no. Now about 6 weeks ago it popped up into my mind again ”What if I took drugs” (Note: I dont do drugs), asked my mate and he said no. Then my mind went to ”What if I killed someone”, but figured Id have heard of someone dying on the party so thats not realistic. Now this is where it becomes annoying, I had a thought ”What if I raped someone?” (Note: Im a very calm guy when drinking, never do anything bad and definitely dont harass women etc etc..), and this thought has been stuck with me ever since. After this thought (I think) I created a memory of a girl laying in the woods and even though I know its 99.999999% a false memory I cant get it out of my head and I keep thinking I did something bad even though the evidence says otherwise. It’s so annoying that I made up a memory (most likely) and now my mind think its a fact. 
Any ideas on what I should do to move on? I keep thinking ”its just OCD, it didnt happen” but then it goes =&gt; ”what if its real, and your life is destroyed?”.

There’s this person. Let’s call her Person A. She has powers, chief among them being the ability to visit other universes where we all make decisions contrary to the ones we’ve made here.

There’s this other person. Let’s call him Person B. He has a very encyclopaedic knowledge of the fallible human mind and its prankish proclivities.

They’re a peculiar pair. They don’t seem to be of any fixed abode because sometimes when I look out my window at 2am, they’re right there, just the two of them, ambling down the middle of the empty street in their pyjamas without a care in the world. They don’t appear particularly disadvantaged beyond that because when I see them in the daytime, they’re always sporting expensive-looking business wear and swinging reusable Waitrose bags to and fro. For ages I knew them just by sight and we’d do that downward-nod-and-stiff-mouth thing when we passed one another in the street and go no further than that. 

Until yesterday, that is. They accosted me when I was on my way to the local park to cringe at the tree resembling Hagrid in a bikini. I rounded a corner and there they were. Without any preamble, they pierced my personal bubble and proceeded to deluge me with their excitable, barely intelligible chatter. 

I was like, ‘Woah, slow down’, but they kept on. Thinking they were trying to sell me something, I tried to bow out and sidestep away, but they steamrolled over each of my verbal attempts to disengage so I just gave up and started trying to process what they were saying. 

They were saying they had powers. Person A said she had unfettered access to other universes and Person B said he could read minds. Lately when we’d crossed paths in the street, he’d observed one or two things in my mind that he believed he and Person A could help me with. I was sceptical.

‘This… doesn’t sound legit,’ I said when they finally stopped yapping. ‘You’re telling me that you—’ I looked at Person A, ‘—can travel to other universes, and you—’ I looked at Person B, ‘—can read minds. Sounds a bit… fiction-y if you ask me.’

‘Alright well, have you ever stopped to examine and interrogate these avoidance behaviours of yours?’ said Person B. ‘You’ve sworn by a labyrinthine list of self-imposed rules for years now, rules that, to you, make perfect sense, but to anyone else are utterly nonsensical.’ He went on to say that despite what I’d convinced myself, my rules and behaviours were, with all due respect, entirely baseless and didn’t stand up to much scrutiny. 

‘Baseless?’ I spluttered. ‘How dare you!’

He continued. My persistent avoidance of actions regarded as mundane by the general population as my way of preventing negative events was being encoded into my motor memory, so to speak. By not holding my breath when I passed someone with pink hair and then noting the next day that I was being visually assaulted by a tree resembling Hagrid in a bikini, I was confirming to myself that the cause was me breathing normally around a pink-haired person, rather than me heading to the park of my own volition where I knew that tree would be. I was equating correlation with causation and bludgeoning these erroneous beliefs deeper and deeper into the primitive part of my brain. My avoidance was just fuelling more avoidance rather than breaking the cycle.

‘And we’re here to help you break that cycle,’ he finished.

‘And erm, can I just butt in?’ said Person A. ‘I mean, like… look.’ She pointed at the tree resembling Hagrid in a bikini standing tall and proud in the middle of a desolate field a few hundred metres away. I winced. ‘You’re reliving that negative event right now, yeah?’

‘Yeah,’ I grimaced through the gaps in my fingers.

‘But… did you even see anyone with pink hair yesterday?’

I cast my mind back. Yesterday I’d seen 20 brunettes, 14 blonds, 3 gingers and 1 green. No pinks were logged.

I was speechless. I opened and closed my mouth a few times like a fish out of water. They’d both got me reconsidering. What they were saying seemed to have merit but it wasn’t conclusive, or at least I didn’t want it to be.

‘It’s a tenuous connection but I swear it’s there!’ I protested. I guess I didn’t want to be proven wrong and have my illusory power over future events taken from me. I wanted the world to remain as moronically simplistic as my self-imposed rules implied, even though really, in the darkest recesses of my mind, I knew it wasn’t. I think I just wanted to labour under the delusion a little longer because if I accepted too soon that things were more complicated, I’d feel powerless. 

‘These connections you’ve made defy common sense,’ Person A said gently. ‘You’re blind to their absurdity because you’ve sworn by them for so long, when actually, they’re demonstrably false. We can bridge your cognitive dissonance for you if you’ll let us.’

There was something about her tone that softened me and I sensed then that I’d profit from submitting. So I let them lead me into one of thicker sections of woodland down the other end of the field where we could exit our universe unseen by any onlookers. 

Everything happened in a span of seconds. We ducked down behind a cluster of trees and joined hands and Person A instructed us to shut our eyes. ‘FWIW I think Hagrid looks rather dashing in a bikini,’ said Person B as we blinked out of existence. 

The teleportation was instant and I didn’t feel my feet leave the ground. The only things that indicated to me that we’d arrived somewhere else were the sudden spike in temperature and the ceasing of the gentle forest breeze caressing my ears. I opened my eyes. We were in my bedroom back at my old house. It was nighttime but temperature-wise, it felt like the sun was still high in the sky. Beads of sweat were already forming on my forehead. 

I looked around and gave a start when I saw myself standing just a few feet away with my back to us. I looked in alarm at Person A and Person B standing beside me. 

‘Don’t worry, we’re invisible,’ she said calmly. ‘This is universe D401. The date is 5th August 2018. Do you remember what happened on this date?’

I looked back at my other self. I was standing by my bed holding my phone. I crept closer to peer over my shoulder. It looked like I was repeatedly setting the alarm and then switching off my phone and then switching it back on again to make sure I’d set it, over and over and over again. I studied my other self’s face. I looked fed up, as if this was the 100th consecutive day that I’d had to perform this silly ritual. 

A bud of recollection suddenly bloomed in my memory. ‘Ah, yeah. This was the last time I only checked my alarm 9 times. It’s been 10 ever since—’ and Person A approached me, nodding, and took my hand. She reached out to Person B with her other hand. I instinctively shut my eyes. 

It was morning. We were standing by the front door watching my other self sifting through the post. I felt some latent disappointment get reignited because I could remember what happened next. I watched as my other self opened a profanity-laden handwritten note from the lady living across the street, wherein she admonished me for hoovering in her driveway. ‘I do not need my driveway hoovered!’ it said.

Obviously I hadn’t actually been hoovering in her driveway ‘cos who does that lmfao… I’d actually been using my metal detector to try and locate Boudica’s grave because y’know how sometimes you can just tell by looking at someone’s driveway that Boudica is buried underneath? Yeah, it was one of those driveways. If only I’d checked my alarm 10 times on the night of 5th August 2018 rather than 9, the lady across the street would never have sent me that note and I’d’ve unearthed Boudica and the drinks would’ve been on me.

I watched my other self sigh dejectedly and vow never to check my alarm only 9 times again. From now on, it’d be 10 times minimum. 

Person B turned to me as my other self slinked away. ‘Now [my name],’ he said. ‘Please explain to me why you linked checking your alarm 9 times with the receipt of this note from your neighbour.’

I explained, and when I was done, Person A and Person B stared at each other, looking thoroughly flummoxed.

‘You really make no concession to logic, do you?’ Person B said.

‘Erm, wh-what?’ I said. ‘Was the…’

Person A raised an eyebrow. 

‘…alarm thing…’ 

Person B was shaking his head in disbelief.  

‘…not the…’ 

Person A was mouthing, ‘Omg…’

‘…cause…?’

They both facepalmed. 

‘Not the sharpest tool in the shed, are you?’ said Person A as she stepped forward and grabbed my hand. My eyes slid closed.

When I opened my eyes again, we were back in my bedroom on the night of 5th August 2018, standing behind another of my selves as I set the alarm. 

‘This is universe D402,’ Person A clarified from my side. ‘Have a look now at how many times your alarm gets checked. Go on.’

I approached my other self to snoop over my shoulder. I watched as I set the alarm, switched off my phone, switched it back on again, checked the alarm and switched off my phone again, over and over again until I’d done it not 9 but 10 times. I turned back to Person A and she grabbed mine and Person B’s hands and yeah, you can probably guess what happened next. The me of universe D402 still received that unfortunate note from the lady across the street and had to bring her Boudica mission to a close. Avoiding checking my alarm 9 times wouldn’t have prevented that negative event after all. 

Person A transported us back to our own universe and the three of us went our own separate ways, with Person B mentioning offhand that Boudica’s grave is actually nowhere near the driveway of my poor, unsuspecting previous neighbour and will in fact be discovered 17 years from now in a place that he’s not legally permitted to disclose. That was certainly a plot twist of magnitude like wtf man who’da thunk it etc.

I haven’t run into them again yet, but I must remember to thank them when I do. The experience lulled me into a mild state of shock that didn’t quite lift in time for me to do so before they bobbed away. 

Anyway, yeah. Their intervention proved to be a roaring success. I now feel a less inflated sense of responsibility over events beyond my control and I glean less false meaning from actions of mine that happen to correlate with unrelated subsequent events. I now check my alarm only 9 times before bed. This has transformed my life.",Avoidance &amp; Checking

I’ve never seen ANYone follow allll of the rules and when I break some that are big to me ... I MUST confess. Rules , laws. I’m obsessed with. And I’m not a good person.

OCD,"Hey guys, I (23F) have been reading quite a lot of reddit stories concerning ocd and I would really appreciate any advice that any of you might have. 

To start with, several months ago I got out of a 7 month relationship with a manipulative guy. Our relationship was full of insult targeted at me, stuff like I am a slut, a whore etc for sleeping with 9 guys prior to him, some of which were just drunken one night stands, one of which I remember only very hazily. We broke up as I started a very exhausting ritual of obsessing about stuff that I most probably have not even done and confessing it to him, which I believe he liked as it put him in control, anyways I decided to leave as I was not able to function even. 

Fast forward to nowadays, I am in a long distance relationship with a very sweet guy, who once mentioned he would never tolerate cheating. Guess what, my ocd went into overdrive thinking about what if I cheated while already being with him, just not being able to concentrate on work or school. 

What's more, I went over to my friend's, we drank quite a bit of wine, leaving me not feeling too well and going outside at night to get some fresh air, meaning listening to music and smoking some cigarettes. Anyways, I had been outside for some 30-40 minutes before returning. Everything most probably fine. 

However, I woke up in the morning, firstly going crazy over the thought that I might have kissed my female friend for fun and thus cheating on my bf. I have no recollection whatsoever of this, yet it wouldn't go away, until I find something better to fixate on. I bumped into like two guys outside as it's lockdown and everyone was supposed to be inside. My amazing brain has figured that even though I was texting my bf most of the time spent on my walk, I somehow managed to have sex with somebody before returning in the 12 minute pause between our texts, catching some STD or getting pregnant. 

I tried to tell my bf that even though I do to some extent realise that this is nonsense, I can't get rid of the feeling of guilt and I even keep coming up with scenarios of how it might have happened. Can somebody please share some of their experience with this? How can I overcome these thoughts? I tried to agree with the thoughts and to tell myself that I won't ever know whether that happened and so on, but it just won't get better and I am starting to go crazy and the most recent appointment I can get is in 3 months. I feel that I might have believed my ex that I am a dirty whore that should be ashamed of herself and won't let go, but I don't know how!

TL;DR: I got drunk and my memory is hazy. I am scared I might have cheating on my bf while on a walk outside at night even though I have no such recollection. Can't get rid of the feeling of guilt and fear that I might have caught an STD or got pregnant, even though I have most evidence that I only met two people outside with whom I haven't even talked. Anyone any experience or advice on how to stop obsessing?",Hazy memories from a night of drinking and cheating worries
OCD,"Hey, I’d love some support or someone to talk to right now. I was talking to a family member about one of my obsessions (relating to body image - it’s something that I haven’t been able to shake for years) and I just got yelled at and told that I was selfish. I reminded them I have OCD and I obviously don’t WANT to be so obsessed with this and then they said me saying I have a mental disorder is always my excuse when I can’t handle something in life.

So I’ll make this short. My HOCD started in the summer when I had this weird thought that I could attracted to male genitals, I don’t know where this came from or if you it was just a new manifestation of my OCD but it plagued me for months, I even started thinking since gay porn doesn’t turn me on maybe it’s women with penises (I don’t know how I came to this conclusion) and when I looked it up I felt groinal responses, it was on and off but to me it didn’t feel like a repressed fetish just HOCD and my sensitivity to seeing a male genital. That was until I asked Reddit and got “plenty of straight men enjoy porn like that it doesn’t mean your gay” and like, fuck I’ve said it so many times that I don’t not enjoy it, I don’t masturbate to it, it’s not a repressed fetish. I don’t understand the concept of this, people tell people with HOCD that the thoughts aren’t real and it’s just OCD fucking with them but when it’s a specific thing it’s suddenly a porn induced fetish, it’s like telling someone with POCD they’re actually into that stuff when it’s just they’re OCD fucking with them. I’m sorry if I come off harsh I’m just frustrated, it feels like no one gets me. At this point maybe it sounds like denial but I genuinely don’t think it’s as deep as a porn induced fetish I feel like I’m just overreacting at the sight of genitalia which is causing those reactions but yeah idk",I don’t get why people keep telling me I have a porn induced fetish or something like that
OCD,"I found out that to finish a compulsion effectively, it helps to say out loud what I just did. Like ""the light downstairs is switched off!"" I haven't learned to fully trust the memories of my actions yet, but I trust my words and I remember them far better. So when I ask myself if I really turned off the light, i just remember that I said it. 

What are your little tricks?",Let's share our little tricks. I start!
OCD,"I’ve been coming to the realization for the past couple months that I might have OCD. It would explain a lot of things I’ve done throughout my life and periods I’ve gone through (a religious theme, an existential theme, rumination, food aversions, worry about harm, reassurance seeking, magical thinking (more so as a child), checking compulsions, bodily fixations, intrusive thoughts, and now a contamination theme). However, I need to start the process of looking for a therapist to evaluate me because the LCSW I’ve been seeing for anxiety and depression cannot diagnose. Since realizing I might actually have OCD, I have been over-analyzing everything I do and have become hyper-aware of almost every thought and action I take and trying to figure out if it means I have OCD. I also keep worrying that I’m just being ridiculous and faking it and am a fraud for saying I might have OCD. I keep researching symptoms and overthinking and replaying memories to see if it could be explained by OCD. It is so exhausting and is getting in the way of focusing on other things like school. If I have it, I can’t tell if this is a symptom. Has anyone currently diagnosed with OCD experienced this in the period before their diagnosis but after coming into awareness about potentially having it? Sorry about all that rambling I’m just super lost about all this! And thank you for reading!",I’m fairly certain I have OCD and am seeking an evaluation and it’s making me very anxious and possibly worsening symptoms if I have it
OCD,"I am wondering how triggers are made in magical thinking. Like for example someone with contamination ocd will need to wash his hands 20 times after touching something, so there is always a link. So even if I don't have that I somewhat can understand where it comes from.

But for me it can be like walking in my appartement and thinking I will have a horrible life in the future and get HIV (se redo till I have a good thought), log in into game and thinking I will have a horrible life and get HIV (so keep login in till I have a good thought about the future), wearing that t shirt and thinking I will have a horrible life and have HIV so change t shirt till I have a good thought with it. Sometimes there are even multiple phases for example. Login to social media (need to have good thought), open chat (need to have good thought), write something (need to have good thought), receive a message (need to have good thought). Everytime I dont have a good thought about my future I need to restart everything from scratch. Like on television there was a show and a girl couldn't eat an M&amp;M cause she tought her family would die. Like how on earth does it attach to an M&amp;M or the most random thing you can think of.

Like the social media example, sometimes I do something I have never done before on the platform and then I need to have a good thought with it. What happens next is I have to have a good thought again with everything I already have done on the platform, like closing, opening, reading a chat message, sending a message to a girl ,... If I don't I will have to do something new on the platform again, have a good thought and everything repeats. This is like mission impossible and even if you try to do compulsions you still can't find the relief cause every compulsion needs to be right and it feels impossible to do like 12 different and random compulsions in a row where you need to have a good thought (so sometimes I stop continuing being on social media if I have 3 compulsions right but I know it will be hell to try and complete every step further the next day). This takes up hours, days of time in my head and I just can't pinpoint how.

I know OCD isn't logical but the fact our life can literally be destroyed by an M&amp;M and you know this is the most absurd thing and you still can't stop the compulsion is so exhausting.

So I can get why someone develops OCD around contamination or relationships, driving, ... But for me I am like so clueless

This probably seems like a silly question with no answer. Still every input or someone that can relate with this is very welcome. Thank you.  


Edit: Like I can think about those thoughts without a problem actually but attach them to something like log in to something and hell breaks loose. ",Magical thinking and the development of triggers

OCD,"I know that sounds insane, but that is one way my OCD has manifested itself. It has been like that for about 10 years now.

There are multiple triggers that set this off, but it's so frustrating because it takes so long to complete the compulsion.

OCD,"So today was a good day, earlier I had in interview for a paid internship who went well and  I also received my college degree by mail. After the interview I was feeling good and happy and I thought « Yeah, this is worth it, I wanna get better » but then BAM, a repressed memory/intrusive thought barged in and fuck me up. 
I’ll give some context, I have had 2 period in my life where I had strong POCD. The first one was 2 years ago and it went on for like 2 months the second started this September and has not stop since. Now my « POCD » is related to teens 15/16-17( sometimes lower but it’s rare). The first period was only toward prepubescent children. So that memory, it happened in the first period, I was barely 19 like not even a month and at the time I was browsing r./gonewild ( I don’t want to link it). At the time I was trying to entertain the idea that I was into adult woman and it’s a addicting format for NSFW stuff. (TW: going forward, I get a bit descriptive)So once I subscribed to this girl, who was cute, like the baby face type cute. I kinda liked her stuff... she was banned for being suspected/or was underaged ( my memory is blurry I can’t recall exactly) I panicked the fuck out, my response was « this is not my fault I would have never looked and subscribed to her if I knew » while it’s true, that reasoning angers me, why was I attracted in the first place. The memory is really blurry and I have difficulty remembering what she looked like, I could tell she was more young-ish looking, today I would have thought that it was sus and not even go there. But I don’t know why I didn’t realized back then, I liked that shit, when posting this somewhere else, they were comments telling me it’s fine that I was a teen also. I don’t know the girls age and I’m can’t recall enough to judge but I should have known, I can remember enough to know that their was something weird. Ironically at the time I thought the fact that my 18 years old friend was in a relationship with a 15 was really weird... I don’t know how but I was able to chase this event from my head and go on with my life. I’ve remembered this a couple weeks ago, I seem to forget easily, I don’t know why. Like know, I have kinda lost that attraction to the baby face type girl, I looked at some match of dating site a while back and I matched with some 18 years old who were young looking, it’s freaks me out more than anything now, it’s not attractive anymore. Sigh, I don’t know I’m kinda scared that I’m still secretly attracted to that or that this event mean that’s it never was POCD,  I’m surprisingly calm but also depressed about this. Like I sealed my faith or something...

I wrote this part in my work break.
So I’m calmer now, it’s still weird, it felt like this wasn’t this big of an issue wich is weird cuz it’s fucking CP, I don’t why sometimes this memory makes me fucking anxious and depressed and sometimes I’m able to brush it off and I somehow think that I’m sure I have POCD.  Sometimes I’m not sure if I’m ashamed of it, I know I definitely was at some point (I think and I wish) I’m not saying I would look for that again, absolutely not, but I feel it’s mostly fear than shame. Weirdly at some point I was a bit angry and kinda felt like a victim in the situation, I don’t know why it sounds so dumb. It feels like I’m not grasping that I was aroused by a minor ( writing this feels weird, not stressed, not relieved, but weird a bit emotionless). At some point I told myself that I should forgive myself, but wtf why, it kinda feel easy and uncaring, I don’t think it’s my place to do that... or I don’t know. I’m not proud I think, I really don’t want to say this carefree to my doctor... my appointment is tomorrow and I’m confuse now. It’s weird I kinda wanna say that I wish it didn’t happen but something is not letting me think that, but I don’t want to do that shit again either, it annoys me... maybe this was traumatizing idk...

OCD,"Bipolar and OCD sufferer here. Both condition provoke a lot of anxiety, which is like an old friend I can't get rid of, no matter what I do or the medication I use. It's always there leaving me breathless, hyperventilating, accompanied by pressure headache and all that shit you are all aware of. 

Anyway... 

Not so long ago, I was eating some food and as I was eating I thought ""Mate... Have you realised that the only time you are not anxious is when you are eating something?"". So I did some research and apparently our brain is wired to feel safe while eating, hence we don't feel anxious when we eat. 

So then I thought, why not using chewing gum?

And this is what I have been doing since and my anxiety decreases a lot when I chew it (for maximum efficiency, I chew 3 chewing gum at the same time). I'm also more focus and witty. I can finally breath and think properly, and not feel on edge all the time.

It's not a cure but it is a good way to treat the symptoms and without sugar, it won't make you fat.

The only downside to this is that of course, after some time the chewing gum doesn't taste good, but it's a million time easier to deal with that than anxiety. 

I would recommend giving it a try. I prefer looking like a hungry cow than an anxious hamster anytime.

OCD,"hey guys,  
Just wondering if anyone has intrusive thoughts that have latched onto something bad someone has said about something/someone you like, or even you’ve had an intrusive thought about it yourself and it’s never gone away?  
just to be clearer with an example, it sounds really dumb but like my favourite animal is the anteater, and once one of my mates was like why do you like them their nose looks like a dick and it was just a stupid passing comment but I haven’t been able to move past it, I have the same with films/music like if I hear a criticism of something I like it then kind of ruins that thing for me and everytime I see it I think of the bad things

OCD,"hi i understand this is about to make me sound nutty but this has been making me nauseous for like a week. 

so i have been with my bf for over two years. we started hooking up in october of 2018, but we were really close friends before that and would cuddle in his bed all the time— which is something that was pretty special, because i wouldn’t let just anybody touch my body like that. i didn’t hook up with anyone else, even when we weren’t exclusive.

anyways, we were pretty much hooking up (not exclusive) for a few months until march 2019, which is when we became exclusive, and we’ve been together ever since. 

this past summer, i asked him if he had sex with anyone other than me while we weren’t exclusive, and he said yes, one other person. but he knew i would spiral, so he wouldn’t tell me anything about her, and actually told me made up facts to mislead me. 

well, fast forward to last saturday. i had a nightmare about it, and basically begged him to tell
me who it was so i could just know and be at peace. he told me he lied about what he had told me originally, and that it’s actually a different girl who i actually know of. this happened right when we started hooking up, but for some reason my brain makes it feel like it happened yesterday. i cannot get the images of him having sex with this girl out of my head, and it is literally keeping me up at night. i feel so nauseous and disgusted, and i feel terrible because he didn’t even do anything wrong, yet i just feel so grossed out. i had a hard time touching him for a little while, because he just felt “contaminated” even though this literally happened two years ago. i tried to explain the feeling to him, but it just made him sad and offended. i really don’t know what to do— things have been going so well with him and now i feel like i just ruined everything. i’m so frustrated with myself because i know logically that he is perfectly clean and it’s absolutely insane to be obsessing over something that happened two years ago and i’m so tired of feeling grossed out and nauseous all the time, like i’m now dirty and contaminated because of this. does anyone have any advice on how to stop obsessing over this? i feel like i’m going crazy :-( please help me",can’t stop obsessing over my bf hooking up with a different girl over two years ago

OCD has been latching onto my sexual thoughts lately, mostly stuff about ‘is it objectifying?’ and things like that. But it’s also kind of moved onto something else now. I’ve noticed that for whatever reason, sexual thoughts and fantasies greatly increase/become harder to resist having whenever I’m lying down in bed. Naturally, this means it ends up happening a lot when I’m trying to go to bed at night.


My older sister sleeps in the bedroom next to mine, we’re just separated by a wall. The problem here is that I have a worry that I genuinely can’t tell is actually rational or not, as OCD could definitely be involved. The strength of the urges I get while in bed mean that I always inevitably keep giving into them and fantasising over and over again, even when every time I stop and feel ashamed and like a creep for thinking about that kind of thing when my sister is only in the next room. It’s a continuous cycle of telling myself not to do it, doing it, feeling bad, and then repeat.


I’m motivated to post this now because something happened last night that really made me feel awful about it. For whatever reason, the fantasy is most vivid when I lie face-down. Furthermore, when I do that, I often exert pressure on and move my body around - I don’t necessarily know why, it just helps in conjunction with the fantasy. But - and here’s kind of a gross part, just a warning - last night after giving in and doing this multiple times I noticed I’d caused precum to come out, possibly partially as a result of the pressure placed on my groin.


Another gross thing - when I was younger, I used to masturbate sometimes when someone was in the next room. I’ve grown up and realised how disgusting that is, but the proximity of this incident to that worries me. Is it even that much different?


On one hand, I feel like the fact that I’ve never questioned this before means most people probably haven’t and it’s just classical obsessive overthinking, so it’s fine. But I don’t know for sure. Even if it isn’t fine I’m scared to realise I’d still probably find it difficult to stop. I don’t know, I guess I just want to hear another person’s opinion",Don’t know if this is actually an issue or not
OCD,"Hey guys, long post ahead but I could do with a friend. 

  I had my Pfizer vaccine two weeks ago and live in the UK. I was surprised they asked me, I do not have a GP as I have moved lately so had to ask the Dr who reviews my medication, he said he did not know why; they must have looked at my files.
I have severe OCD, which means I’ve essentially been isolating since the start of lockdown, but I’ve never really been helped by doctors or mental health services who just up the doses of my pills and send me away for another year with promises of a waiting list. I’ve been on a psych ward twice for suicide attempts, once for four months , and my eating gets very bad with my OCD; meaning my weight can drop as I stop eating altogether when contamination fear becomes too much and disinfecting food becomes too hard. I also started talking to an alcohol counsellor about my alcohol use which is caused by OCD (I also have to disinfect alcohol).

Now because I’ve been so let down by the services that were supposed to help me over the last ten years, I was naturally suspicious to be invited for a vaccine. Why would people who had put me on antipsychotics for sleep aged 16 because I was having night terrors and then look at me blankly for the next ten years when I mention how they’ve stolen my life as I’m so tired all the time and can’t sleep without them, even though they’ve admitted it was wrong to ever put me in them; suddenly want to help me?  A year into them, I tried to get off them, now it’s been ten. 

Anyway... I took the vaccine, much like I took the pills aged 16, because I was desperate and didn’t care for the reasons, or I did but anything had to be better than living in fear right? 

Now I’ve taken it, I’m wondering why I was offered. I’m not a key worker. It barely seems doctors listen when I talk to them. My pills don’t seem to be immunsuppresants.

One of my OCDS is HIV. Two years ago, I slept with a guy who I was in supported housing with. Only once, and he didn’t cum and I also gave him head once and he didn’t cum.  He died a month or so later of an overdose and I was called in to be questioned on the nature of our relationship; it turned out he had HIV. So, I had to be tested. I had a pin prick test and a blood test at the hospital, then I had another a few weeks later at a clinic. All negative. A few weeks later, I went to the doctors and requested another one - I think it had been around three months since I’d slept with him and I’d read about incubation periods. Again, negative. I didn’t believe it though so a week or so later I requested a full blood count. My tests came back there was nothing wrong with me. My doctor at the time said ‘there is NO WAY you have it. You need to get that out of your head.’ 

I read online about probability and knew I probably didn’t have it; but naturally I went to the articles that said it could have six months incubation period or more, and became convinced I had it anyway. Being selected for the vaccine.. I wonder if doctors know something I don’t? Maybe I have hiv and they haven’t told me?

Thanks so much for reading. 
Do you think I have HIV? Why else would I be selected?",Why was I chosen for the vaccine??
OCD,"Ever since I was young, I remember looking at the world differently. It seemed I always “read into things” more. I always had to know why, for what, who, when, and how?

As I am approaching the age of 18 the monster that lives inside my head has reared its ugly face in it’s entirety. I’ve struggled extensively with POCD, Philosophical OCD, HOCD, Rape OCD, Sexuality OCD, Moral OCD, Relationship OCD, and more. I’ve been through 4 month longs bouts of torturous dissociation and have convinced myself of the most ridiculous things due to my paranoia. 

I genuinely struggle every day. Even when the obsessive thoughts aren’t there, I have a feeling in my chest like there’s something lurking right under the surface: if I look at one wrong image or hear one wrong lyric in a song I am fucked. 

My thoughts have always been extremely loud. The voice I think with is crystal clear and booming all the time. I am so utterly mentally exhausted it’s ridiculous, and I’m at the point where I get a lot of suicidal thoughts... I would never do it, but I find comfort in the thought of putting an end to it.

My dad says everything is in my head and that I’m crazy. Some friends make fun of me for worrying relentlessly about things they don’t worry about: “I drank moonshine last night and now I feel weird, could I have methanol poisoning? I kissed a girl, am I sure it was consensual?! What do you think? My girlfriend likes to go on drives, what if she’s just meeting some guy to fuck? What if? I thought that girl was pretty, should I break up with my girl right now and just save the pain? Am I a rapist? Am I a terrible person? Should I turn myself in?”

It all feels real. I’m getting better but this is such a big beast to fight. Weed barely helps and makes it worse a lot, last time I tripped I sent myself down a dissociative episode for months because I got into philosophy, and alcohol makes me cry. 

This is too much guys. It’s crazy that this is an invisible disease, because to me it’s so apparent that there’s something wrong.

OCD,"The reason why I’m unsure it’s POCD (TW)

So today was a good day, earlier I had in interview for a paid internship who went well and  I also received my college degree by mail. After the interview I was feeling good and happy and I thought « Yeah, this is worth it, I wanna get better » but then BAM, a repressed memory/intrusive thought barged in and fuck me up. 
I’ll give some context, I have had 2 period in my life where I had strong POCD. The first one was 2 years ago and it went on for like 2 months the second started this September and has not stop since. Now my « POCD » is related to teens 15/16-17( sometimes lower but it’s rare). The first period was only toward prepubescent children. So that memory, it happened in the first period, I was barely 19 like not even a month and at the time I was browsing r./gonewild ( I don’t want to link it). At the time I was trying to entertain the idea that I was into adult woman and it’s a addicting format for NSFW stuff. (TW: going forward, I get a bit descriptive)So once I subscribed to this girl, who was cute, like the baby face type cute. I kinda liked her stuff... she was banned for being suspected/or was underaged ( my memory is blurry I can’t recall exactly) I panicked the fuck out, my response was « this is not my fault I would have never looked and subscribed to her if I knew » while it’s true, that reasoning angers me, why was I attracted in the first place. The memory is really blurry and I have difficulty remembering what she looked like, I could tell she was more young-ish looking, today I would have thought that it was sus and not even go there. But I don’t know why I didn’t realized back then, I liked that shit, when posting this somewhere else, they were comments telling me it’s fine that I was a teen also. I don’t know the girls age and I’m can’t recall enough to judge but I should have known, I can remember enough to know that their was something weird. Ironically at the time I thought the fact that my 18 years old friend was in a relationship with a 15 was really weird... I don’t know how but I was able to chase this event from my head and go on with my life. I’ve remembered this a couple weeks ago, I seem to forget easily, I don’t know why. Like know, I have kinda lost that attraction to the baby face type girl, I looked at some match of dating site a while back and I matched with some 18 years old who were young looking, it’s freaks me out more than anything now, it’s not attractive anymore. Sigh, I don’t know I’m kinda scared that I’m still secretly attracted to that or that this event mean that’s it never was POCD,  I’m surprisingly calm but also depressed about this. Like I sealed my faith or something...

I wrote this part in my work break.
So I’m calmer now, it’s still weird, it felt like this wasn’t this big of an issue wich is weird cuz it’s fucking CP, I don’t why sometimes this memory makes me fucking anxious and depressed and sometimes I’m able to brush it off and I somehow think that I’m sure I have POCD.  Sometimes I’m not sure if I’m ashamed of it, I know I definitely was at some point (I think and I wish) I’m not saying I would look for that again, absolutely not, but I feel it’s mostly fear than shame. Weirdly at some point I was a bit angry and kinda felt like a victim in the situation, I don’t know why it sounds so dumb. It feels like I’m not grasping that I was aroused by a minor ( writing this feels weird, not stressed, not relieved, but weird a bit emotionless). At some point I told myself that I should forgive myself, but wtf why, it kinda feel easy and uncaring, I don’t think it’s my place to do that... or I don’t know. I’m not proud I think, I really don’t want to say this carefree to my doctor... my appointment is tomorrow and I’m confuse now. It’s weird I kinda wanna say that I wish it didn’t happen but something is not letting me think that, but I don’t want to do that shit again either, it annoys me... maybe this was traumatizing idk...

When I haven’t done a ritual properly there is actual evidence of things happening that I say can’t happen.

Example: I will do a counting ritual, with going back and forwards, no consistency so I’m not counting the seconds. Then I have to watch something and have a certain word being said before I can finish. The one stipulation though is when I finish the ritual, the second hand on my iPhone clock cannot be exactly on the 4 or the 8. There is a single digit chance of that happening actually, however I check my clock and there it is, 3 times in a row it is on that number. That cannot be confirmation bias because it is consecutive. 

To mention as well I was counting the number of words in a re-edit post just randomly and it equaled 53, I don’t like that it was so close to 50 so I stopped counting at 47. I realised that it averaged out to 50 and I don’t like that because it means I will have an average life. THEN, the very next comment which I had not read earlier mention 47-53.

Anyhow, I am currently in a new relationship (about two months in, but we had about a month or so of getting to know each other/courtship). I’ve managed to keep my confession compulsion at bay this far. How?

When I feel that anxiety, that urges to spill my guts to my newfound love and tell her all the bad I’ve ever done so that she can see the “real me” and decide if she wants to be with me or not. I ask myself this:

Would I want to hear the same things from her? Or would it just upset me? If she told me about some sexual thing from her past, it would just make me uncomfortable. If she told me she found someone else attractive it would hurt me. If she told me she was still chatting with someone else when we first met, it would just make me feel insecure. 

NOT BECAUSE ANY OF THESE THINGS ARE WRONG OR WOULD MAKE HER A BAD PERSON, BUT BECAUSE I SIMPLY DONT NEED TO HEAR THEM. 

I’m just using these as examples of some of the ridiculous things I’ve confessed to previous partners or gotten the urge to confess. 

We all have things we’ve done that we aren’t proud of, and we will likely continue to do or say things we aren’t proud of. 

But please, next time you have the urge to confess what a “monster” you are to your partner. Ask yourself that question. What purpose would it serve your relationship? And would you REALLY want to hear the same from your partner?

At this point I had no idea that was OCD. A bit after this time I found that watching YouTube, a movie, or anything on TV I wouldn’t be able to focus and I would be thinking about a small thing that was bothering me, like the position of the computer mouse or the position of the tv remote or what shirt I had on, little tiny things that would occupy my mind so much.

I’ll just sit there trying to think about what shirt or pants I could wear that wouldn’t bother me all day. Eventually I pick one and then it proceeds to be on my mind throughout the whole day anyway. Small things like this on my mind make me feel terrible and they’re truly on my mind 24/7, even when I’m relaxing or having fun with friends there’s always something in my mind saying somethings off, like what I’m wearing or what shoes I have on or whether or not I have to use the bathroom. The bathroom thing sometimes causes me to go to the bathroom and try to pee over and over again even though i can’t at all. It just feels like I need to get everything out but I can’t so I keep trying. When things like this are on my mind it clouds my thoughts and I can’t think properly. I get anxious when I’m about to meet with friends sometimes because I don’t know what I’m gonna say to them and I feel like they’re gonna lose interest in me because I won’t have a conversation with them properly. As of lately I’ve been thinking about all these things and I don’t know why but it feels like everything I’ve been through the past while has been clouded by these OCD thoughts and I truly haven’t enjoyed a single moment in so long. I start worrying about the future and the rest of my life every day because I feel like all the important moments are gonna be drowned out by a random thought that just keeps showing up in my head over and over and I can never feel comfortable physically or in my mind. It always seems like the best or most fun moments in my life are affected the worst because my brain targets them and any moment I’m having a good time my brain reminds itself that I have OCD to worry about. It just feels hopeless and even though I’m only 16 I feel like I’ve wasted so much time and I want to change it. I wanna live the rest of my life free from these thoughts and just be normal. I don’t know what to do.",Been struggling and I feel hopeless
OCD,"This is just going to be a rant. So I am 17 and live with my mom, and I’m on a phone plan with her. We were talking at dinner with another family member, and we were talking about how my sister was always playing an online game that she loves. My sister plays this game for hours a day and messages about it from her iPad and plays online with her friends. My mom started talking about how she even texts about it and she has seen the things she sends her friends about it, and she talked about a specific video that my sister sent. She said that she gets emails whenever my sister messages someone and is able to see what she is talking about. Then my mom said “my kids don’t know how much I can actually see” and smiled at me. This horrified me. For context, I have obsessions about my online presence and people being able to see what I’m doing online (I’m not doing anything illegal or creepy, I just like being private). This also applies to social media, and I have deleted several accounts on different platforms before because I don’t want to be seen by others. Me and my mom do not really have a good relationship, there is no trust between us and I can’t really talk to her about anything. I am ok with this because I have a couple really close friends that I am very open with and text every day. I talk to my friends about really niche, weird fandom things, people I have crushes on, and overall a lot of really personal stuff. The idea of my mom reading my texts horrifies me. I have said some very personal things to my friends that we keep between us and I do not want anyone else to see what I said. I don’t know how she does this, maybe it’s something with iCloud or Apple ID or whatever, but I do not want her to be able to see the things I say. I did some research and found that people on family phone plays cannot see the content of the messages, only the date/time/number, but my mom implied that she gets emails whenever one of us sends a text. Now I am completely freaking out and considering deleting all apps and accounts on my phone, and I went to text my friends about it but then I realized that mu mom might be able to see what I say. I’m about to have a panic attack about it and it is eating away at my mind. I already have extreme anxiety and obsessions over my online presence to the point where I sometimes can’t even use google because I don’t want my search to be recorded and seen by the “fbi” or whatever. My mom doesn’t know how much she affected me with this, and I feel awful. This may not sound like something to do with my ocd, but I promise you my obsessions about the internet have plagued me for a long time. Just a rant, thanks for reading.",My mom just implied that she reads my texts and triggered my obsessions about using my phone/online presence

And that they do not like me because I can recall certain moments where they were upset with me.

Whenever I get overwhelmed with school and assignments, my intrusive thoughts are like “get in an accident or end up in the hospital so you have an excuse not to do anything.” I’m in a group project right now and someone actually did just get into a car accident, so we have to postpone some of our group work.

OCD,"Through a lot of therapy, and a whole lot of knowing SOMETHING was up, but not knowing exactly what - I finally got a diagnoses. 

Through therapy and seeing a psychiatrist I learned that I have OCD, a diagnoses is SO relieving and through a whole bunch of lurking through this sub I found a lot of relatability and just a safe space overall, I was able to come to terms with the fact that I’m not overexaggerating &amp; I deserve treatment and to feel better. 

So, my issue. My whole life has been centered around control, I’m first generation American and my mother comes from the Soviet Union so I’m assuming her paranoia, narcissism and control issues are results of her own trauma. None the less, I developed a lot of the anxiety I have today as a result. There were so many more things leading up to my mental health, but I’m not here to get into that (maybe at a later time). 

As a result I have so.much.anxiety when it comes to seeing a doctor. I think that everything is wrong with me, and that the doctors and staff will look down on me for whatever reason, it’s this irrational thought I have that I know is irrational but I can’t get any peace. It took me months and months of making appointments, and not showing up to appointments in order to actually make it to one. Then the cycle repeats. I want to be healthy, and I want to see my dentist and other doctors, I want help but I just can’t. 

Does anybody else have this issue? How do you resolve it? I am able to keep in contact with my therapist due to the shift to over the phone therapy ever since the pandemic but it’s weekly and I just never really get to that particular issue since we have so much to go through within the one hour I get to speak to her.

OCD,"I've been having pOCD for about a month now, and it's been getting much much worse in the last week or so... but something happened yesterday and I'm extremely scared/disgusted at myself. (Graphical content ahead) So I was really really anxious yesterday and wanted to masturbate in order to ""test"" myself if I was a p#do or not, I went to the bathroom and started masturbating and thinking about adults/adult stuff, all was well, but suddenly this intrusive image of a child appeared in my head and it just happened so fast, I felt this really intense anxiety/disgust/paranoia feeling in my stomach, as if it was turning upside down, and I ejaculated... but I felt nothing while ejaculating, literally nothing, just disgust and paranoia. At that point I was very sure that I was a p#do in denial, I felt utterly horrible, like my life was over, I just laid in bed and stared at the wall until I fell asleep, I couldn't even cry... so today I tried it AGAIN but I was much less anxious overall (I think), I went to the shower and masturbated, the intrusive child images appeared and I just let them be, I didn't feel aroused by them at all, and continued masturbating and thinking about the usual adult stuff I always think about. I ended up ejaculating but it just felt much better, with actual pleasure while thinking about the adult stuff, not that mix of paranoia and disgust... but I'm still scared whether I might be a p#do in denial or not. I don't feel aroused when looking at children (or do I? idk anything anymore at this point, I just keep testing myself when I see a child or pre-teen, over and over again, to see if I felt something, and I feel a bit of groin movement)... and idk this weird masturbation thing happened in the past as well.. like sometimes I'd masturbate and there'd be intrusive thoughts of incest (such as images of my mom or my great aunt or my grandpa) and I'd get so anxious that I'd cum right away, but didn't felt anything, just felt ""yucky"".. anyways, am I having pOCD or am I just a p#do in denial??

OCD,"I understand the mechanics behind ERP, at least to an extent. And I understand that it might be particularly useful for specific fears that can be treated with exposure in-person: if I’m scared of e.g. dogs, I can understand that gradually exposing myself to dogs to show my brain why dogs aren’t actually scary might work.

What I’m struggling with is imaginal exposure, and what I’m meant to think / respond with when I’m doing it. Suppose I expose myself to a story or narrative about my fear (e.g. I’m going to kill my child). That gives a whole lot of anxiety. But what do I tell myself about the nature of that thought while I’m doing this?

1. If I say to myself ‘that’s not true, I’m doing this for exposure, this is just OCD’ am I really exposing myself to the thought? I am giving myself reassurance, and often won’t believe it even if I come to a conclusion here...

2. On the other hand if I tell myself ‘this is true, or could be true’ I get so triggered and distressed that I can’t get on with my day at all. And it would affect my behaviour: if I really believed the thought and thought my child was in danger I would take steps to protect it.

3. The third route is to accept uncertainty, something I often see in OCD circles, but really this just a variant on acceptance: accepting I could kill my child. Again, if it were that easy I would have done it. And I don’t see how living normally with the idea that I could kill my child is possible. It’s a question of degree. If I genuinely think there’s a 85% chance I could kill my child, I would lock myself away for their sake. And I don’t want to do that...

So how should I view the content of exposure exercises when the question in my head is “is the feared thought true?” Any thoughts here would be welcome.",ERP and attitudes towards feared object

OCD,"Hey, I'm struggling a lot right now.

I can't do anything right now. Anything I do my OCD tells me it's because of some other bad thing. Like, if I decide to do something after reading a post here, my OCD tells me the poster *could* be a bad person, and that would mean I only decided to do that thing because of this bad person, so I end up doing nothing. It's been SIX MONTHS since I did anything with my life. If I say I had enough, then surely it's because I saw random thing Y and that ultimately put me in this line of thought so if I do break free from this theme it's only thanks to Y (which is always a bad thing like a bad person or event). This is one of the worst themes for me, I can't even perform compulsions to escape it. I'm even afraid that if someone replies to this post with useful advice, well what if this person is a pedophile?? I can't let a pedophile be the thing that frees me from this theme!

I don't know what to do. I posted about this before but I'm still struggling. Hopefully someone understands. And of course I'm reluctant to post this because when I started thinking about this some random bad person popped up in my mind, so *maybe* if it weren't for that person I wouldn't have thought about making this post or something.

Today, during meditation, I worked on actively suppressing these muscle movements to try and fully relax. Although difficult, I liked the way it made me feel in that I felt more relaxed overall.

OCD,"i’m really not sure what i can do at this point, a major part of my ocd is impulsive buying, so if i don’t buy something when my ocd tells me to then i will start having ocd attacks or panic attacks. i’m still a teenager so i don’t get much money often. however when i do its spent in ways i don’t want it to be spent because of ocd, please hear me out with this. 

everytime i’m in a shop, if there is a bag of marbles i will absolutely have to buy them or else i will start having either a panic attack or an OCD attack, obviously i want to avoid both of these at all costs, so i obey my ocd and just buy the bag of marbles. however, when i’m doing this almost everytime i go shopping it is starting to waste a lot of money. another thing is is that if i don’t have enough for the marbles i have to put something back that i’m already buying to buy these marbles. this wastes a lot of money.

i used to want this book, it’s about £16 so it’s not that much. however i got some money recently, by the time i got this money i no longer wanted the book. but i had to buy it because my ocd was telling me i had to (i think you all know what i mean by that eh) and so i spent £16 of my money on something i didn’t want because i had to.

it feels like i’m trapped in a cage of my own brain just obeying and obeying constantly in fear of getting hurt. and there are so many things i can’t do anymore just because my ocd says no i’m not aloud. it’s terrifying and i’m at the point where i’m getting ocd attacks from being paranoid about having ocd attacks. i just don’t know what to do at this point i’m scared and i wish i cour just enjoy my life like all my friends can but all of these restrictions from my ocd are stopping me. i know i’m not the only one and i’m so sorry to all of you who are also going through this. just know you’re not alone in this.

I can't take this anymore, I've had religious OCD when I was 13, had harm OCD at 16/17, general OCD (checking stuff a thousand times) my entire life, but nothing comes close to the amount of suffering I'm having with this thing called pOCD right now as I'm 22yo. At this point I'm pretty much convinced I'm a disgusting p### in denial, I can't sleep or eat properly, stopped doing everything I loved (such as listening to music, drawing, playing games), I basically just can't stop thinking about this pOCD all day and night. Whenever I see or think about children, I feel movements in my groin and this weird anxiety feeling in my stomach (I don't get hard though), and I just want to k#ll myself when that happens, I spend a long time just questioning myself stuff like ""did I feel atracted to that child? omg i think i felt attracted, omg"", yesterday something really weird happened, I tried masturbating to ""test"" myself and at first I was thinking about adults (as I always did), nothing happened, I couldn't feel aroused anymore, but then this image of a child appeared in my head and suddenly I got this horrible feeling as if my stomach was turning upside down due to anxiety, and I ejaculated right away, but it didn't feel good.. I felt nothing while ejaculating, literally nothing, and if anything I became even more desperate about being a p#do, at that point I just thought it was a death sentence to me, I went to bed and couldn't even cry myself to sleep, all I could do was lay there and think about how my life was over... eventually I fell asleep and woke up feeling calmer, I remembered that I had this kind of experience in the past, such as when I was masturbating and intrusive images of my mom or my grandpa would appear in my head for example, and I'd ejaculate right away (without feeling anything, just out of sheer anxiety), so that made me calmer... but I'm still scared, I mean there's something blocking me from feeling attracted/horny to adults now, idk whether it's OCD playing tricks on me, or whether it's because I'm depressed, or whether I've been in denial of being a p#do my whole life and now I'm ""finding out"", I'm just so f#cking scared, I can't tell anyone (like a therapist or doctor) because they'll probably think I'm a p*do and report me to the police, can't tell my mom because I think she'll hate me, I'm feeling hopeless right now.
