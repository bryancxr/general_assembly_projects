And it's not worth it to stay here if you don't have at least a good view.   Staff was extremely friendly and polite.   The second day we switched to our actual room. Floor 42, city view.

It is Vegas style so if you do not like that sort of hotels then this hotel is not for you. We loved that it was connected to a shopping center (very expesnive brands) and there were restaurants, spas and hairdressers for pampering. It is also 10 minutes away by metro to the famous shopping street Orchard Rd. The infinity pool on the 57th floor is amazing but not for spending a whole day there. I think it is really for posing for pictures, staying for a drink and then moving on. Stay in a club room if you can as we saw quite a long line for breakfast for non-club rooms.

I did find that concierge was particularly helpful and patient, even with the volume of people they must work with. Once I got to the front of the line, concierge patiently helped me identify a suitable place for a birthday celebration that I wanted to arrange.

In this review I will try to give some tips that I collected from my stay there: 1. Check-In and Check-Out - I did the check-in process in the enterance to towers 1+2. It took 40 minutes. To shorten the process, I recommend having the check-in next to tower 3 - that's much easier and faster. Checkout was done there in no time.. 2. Breakfast - the hotel offers a 48SGD breakfast. You can save it by walking 5-10 minutes inside the mall - you'll find a 10SGD breakfasts+ there.  3. Ku-De-Ta - try to get early, there's not much room to sit at night, as the place fills up pretty fast. Beers are better than the cocktails there... 4. Casino - not anything like",10.0,2015-04-01

Firstly, I'm sure that all rooms in this hotel are equally luxurious, so my first recommendation would be to select a bay view room. From this you will see the myriad of shipping lights in the bay itself plus the illuminated gardens and be witness to the nightly light show and music. The only downside is that the massive ground floor area is more like an airport that a welcoming hotel lounge. That area is constantly busy and there are few places to find solitude.

How incredibly funny when you know nothing about the hotel and are travelling with children.  1.  If you like to queue to check in this hotel is for you.  MBS is MASSIVE with very few staff.  You feel unimportant and one of the masses as soon as you arrive.  2.  Premier Inns are great and serve a purpose.  The rooms at MBS are less well equipped than Premier Inns and not as comfortable.

Also, the free wifi made things much easier, this service really needs to be offered as standard by all 5star hotels.  We booked this hotel simply because of the rooftop pool and we were not disappointed, the views across Singapore were amazing, however the pool does get very busy (especially around 5pm).

The famous pool on 57 is quite amazing, but very crowded, and getting a lounge chair is quite a challenge at times.  Spectacular to look at, but simply too big and we won't return.
