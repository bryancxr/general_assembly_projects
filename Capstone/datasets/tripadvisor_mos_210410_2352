One set of lifts only goes up, the other set of four lifts go up and down, but you have to push the call buttons on both sides to maximise your opportunity to catch a lift.  While this is a first world problem it's irritating and means that you also end up stopping at lots of floors where there is no one to collect as they also push both buttons but were picked up by the other side of the four lifts.

My only suggestion would be to add convenient power outlets on the nightstand.
