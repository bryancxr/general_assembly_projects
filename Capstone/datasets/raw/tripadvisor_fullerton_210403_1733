Try to take a walk to One Fullerton for a great view of the city or to the Esplanade area to Glutton's Bay for a collection of well known local hawker fare. Recommend to sign up for the complementary Heritage tour by the hotel, which lasts for about an hour and the guide provides insights into the history of the hotel, the location.

A wide variety of eastern breakfast and staple western selection was more than adequate however it didn't seem to make an overwhelming impression on my tastebuds. Service was adequate but our table for 6 a bit cramped by the wall.

Another fantastic feeling was staying in a suite room category. All these were made possible by the staff Sharon Ng and Paolo who were helpful, accommodating and served with passion/smiles. Not forgetting the great service by the team from club lounge too; Laura, Kash, Shanti, Denise and Hideo (on leave but showed concern for me). The gym was comprehensive and clean and the spa and gym staff always put a smiling face which made the guests felt welcome.

The building is very impressive, but to my eyes, a little pompous and pretentious. However, that's a very personal thing, and I know others love it. The staff are good, although it took 25 minutes to get our luggage down when we checked out. We booked a Quay - exterior - room, and I specifically asked for a quiet room. We were given a room facing Marina Bay. The view was spectacular, but there was traffic noise all day and night.
