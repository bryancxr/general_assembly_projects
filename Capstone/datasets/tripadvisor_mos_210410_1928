723909441,mos,tripadvisor,2019-11-01,California,Great for a Long Business Trip,"I stayed 11 nights at this hotel for a business trip.  Pros: 1) I had an ""executive"" room, which gave me access to the club on the 38th floor. The free laundry/pressing option alone was enough to merit the extra cost for this room. Being able to get two pieces of clothing washed every day was a tremendous benefit, especially given the hot and humid weather. 2) The club was a great place to go for drinks and appetizers in the early evening. Breakfast there was enjoyable. 3) I ate at Chatterbox twice and the food was great!  Cons: 1) The air conditioning cooled everything off, but it was quite damp in my room. My bedsheets felt damp, the paper left on my desk was damp. 2) I wish there were a gym in the Orchard Wing. I did not like going all the way down to the 5th floor, walking",8.0,2019-10-01

It's greatest asset are the staff  I've been in hotels like Morocco and England where my clothes money and equipment disappear.  On the first night I had to shower and change quickly to go out with my friend . I was terrible leaving everything all over the floor. When I returned at 10pm I thought it's happen again . My clothing was gone , no towels on the floor and tablet missing.  Wait a minute the towels had gone replaced by new clean ones. My clothes hung up on hangers or in drawers. My tablet on top of the safe and the bed sheet rolled back and fruit in the room. I was tired and not meeting till 2pm . I hung the do not disturb sign up. Stripped off and dropped onto the bed.

The hotel staff told me  that my room category  that I have booked and paid which was a Superior Deluxe & non smoking room wasn’t available . So , they left me only with the smoking rooms and it’s located in the Orchsrd wings tower. Upon arrival at the room I could notice that the room category wasn’t the same as my booking and I protested to the front desk and later was moved to the Meritus Club room on the 30th floor and promised to be given my intended Superior room the following day. The next day I was called by the duty manager Dayan informing me that I could make my switch to the Superior room.

However music playing late at night locally made for an unsound sleep. The disappointment was with the staff recommendations for a tourist in town - I asked 3 different staff members where we could find some good reasonably priced food locally. Well - we were told that Dempsey was where all the food restaurants were - a taxi ride out there was a waste - it was such a strange collection of non Singaporean restaurants? - long story short - why would they not recommend Clarke Quay which we found the next day? Or Haji Lane which was groups of cool little eateries? I suggest they sharpen up their skills and help people to discover good food in Singapore which incidentally is not at their in house,4.0,2018-10-01
626876057,mos,tripadvisor,2018-10-01,,Mandarin orchard- NOT GOOD,It is rated as the five star hotel but the rooms are of a lower standard. The main hall and the reception area looks good but rooms make you feel like you are in staying at a 3 star hotel.  It is deceiving for others. We came from One Ferrer Park Hotel and the experience was amazing and now it feels like we are at a 3 star hotel at the madarin orchard hotel.   If you are looking to stay at a luxury hotel please note that the rooms are not renovated. We paid extra for an upgraded room and it is still a 3 star.

The following week when I came back to the hotel, my previous week hotel bill was not send to my email yet. I find that was very late already considering it has lapsed for 2/3 days. So when I checked out on my second week, I’ve decided not to use the express check out option anymore. I went to the check out counter. When the hotel staff passed me the bill, I found out there were extra charges in it which I did not incur. It was mini bar charges.
