It's a beautiful building & linked to the Gardens by the Bay which is also beautiful. However it is very impersonal & very expensive (& I don't think justifies the price tag). The room was huge (probably too big) and the sofa bed which had my 2 sons in creaked endlessly. The furnishings re lovely & it does feel luxurious (especially the bathroom) - and the view over the Gardens is great), however even from the 9th floor you can hear the traffic noice of the busy road below. We spent all day by the pool (1pm - 8pm) and even had dinner there - the views are incredible. But it is so busy and getting pool service was a struggle.

The infinity pool has to be the highlight and we took numerous photos of ourselves with an amazing backdrop.  The obligatory Singapore Sling was necessary although we had two each and a club sandwich and that was £80 which was excessive but we were in holiday mode so we felt we could spoil ourselves!

It’s incredibly overcrowded all hours of the day.   Presumably in an effort to only allow hotel guests on the roof you have to use your hotel key to enter and exit the rooftop, which is fine - but they also have manned key in/key out turnstiles like every 50 feet as you walk the length of the roof - it’s a little much.

Many things failed to impress me at MBS let me highlight a few, the list can go on:-  1.

The Marina Bay is a lovely hotel and we had a beautiful room-a Grand Suite with the club.

The pyrimid of Singapore,"We saw this hotel in the process of being built 8 years ago and it is such a monolith on the Singapore landscape that you must visit at least once which is what we did and were not disappointed. The hotel is terrific in every aspect combined with the usability and spectacular views from the pool to the shopping, entertainment and casino I found the Marina Bay Sands to be quite special. I loved the automation of the curtains opening on entry to expose the beautiful garden by the bay and busy harbour beyond. A little on the expensive side however well worth it except for the outrageously expensive laundry service I was well and truly pleased with my stay at MBS.",10.0,2018-12-01

This is the place to experience once per life and you should experience it as there is no any other place like swimming pool at Marina Bay Sands.

Let me explained.  This hotel is just massive, three hotels in one, only 20 minutes from the airport by taxi around $15-$20 Singapore. You have to make sure you tell the taxi driver which tower otherwise you will have a big walk to the correct lobby.  A big tip is within 24 hours of arriving you can book in online.  This will save you massive amounts of time in the line.  If there is a big line which there was when we arrived I just asked a staff member that I had booked online and he put me straight into the checkout counter.

The pool is amazing which you can’t get to unless you staying.  They really don’t cater for you if you don’t eat meat , if you’re vegan or plant based, you have sadly no chance . Asia is built on meat dishes , try and explain your plant based and you will get a strange look 👀.  Great hotel bangin pool Be prepare to go hungry ",6.0,2018-05-01
586308127,mbs,tripadvisor,2018-06-01,Switzerland,Too expensive for the experience,"The hotel with its remarkable architecture offers magnificent views from the rooftop and from rooms at higher levels. However, there is nothing special about the rooms at levels 15 and below - just a standard 4 star room without views but with traffic noise if your room us located at the garden side. These rooms are highly overpriced. Complimentary internet is slow and is way below standard for a hotel of this class. Rooftop swimming pool offers fantastic views but is generally crowded. Everything is ridiculously overprized.",6.0,2018-05-01

As we were about to enter the hotel, a staff greeted and helped us with our luggage. Upon entering the hotel, I could feel what a massive and luxurious property it is. There were multiple long queues for check in but the process was very quick and swift so it did not take much time. The staff was smiling, pleasant and amiable.  Our room was on 42nd floor and as soon as we entered the room, we were in complete amazement. What a huge room it was ! French window in the room or I should say the glass wall provided such a fabulous view of the city from the room.  The washroom was also substantially big and beautifully done up.

However be warned do not do anything with the front desk as they are totally incompetent.  Eight of us flew over from Australia for a surprise birthday and marriage proposal. The hotel did not provide the birthday request as paid for & reinforced in about 5 emails, rather they took it upon themselves to put ""will u marry me"" on the bed in rose petals in the unexpected couple's room on the day we arrived!  U can imagine the utter shock we all got when this was not what we had paid for / asked for and all of this ruined the weekend and all other plans the groom had planned for his proposal during his stay in Singapore. What a costly mistake - if the groom had wanted to put petals on a bed surely we could have done this",2.0,2018-06-01

There’s a bit of a wait to check in, but the rooms are impeccable and just very comfortable. The mall is great for additional dining options and you can work off the extra calories by talking a walk in the Gardens by the Bay. A special thank you to the staff by the pool who were very kind and personable, and kept the drinks flowing. Great job, MBS!

The hotel itself is very grand and upmarket (you get what you pay for) but we only stayed one night.   Once you’ve had the obligatory selfies and photos in the infinity pool then it’s just a hotel with good views from your room which is clean and a little upmarket. We were surprised that the food wasn’t too overpriced nor were the drinks. The hotels in a great location for the gardens by the bay and the other activities around that end of Singapore.   We also left tea really late and tried to find somewhere open (it was around midnight/1 am) I wouldn’t recommend the food hall as there was one place open and it didn’t look great.

However this stay totally changed my impression of your service provider. My husband fell down and cut his hand prior to arriving at the hotel. While queuing up to check-in, your staff Kateline See, who happened to walk by, noticed & asked about his well being and offered to render him First Aid. My husband was very impressed with Kateline's ability to spot his minor injury even though we don't need any first aid because it was just a superficial wound.  Furthermore, Kateline noticed my 2 year old son was getting restless during the check-in process & proactively distracted him while we were handling the check-in administration.

It’s location means you are severely restricted for food options, which means price is high and variety is limited. The Gardens are right next door but my personal recommendation is head to Orchard Rd as a base then travel via the highly efficient MRT rail system to take in the tourist sights - The Gardens, Santosa etc.",6.0,2018-05-01

This hotel is one of the largest I've ever stayed in. Yes, expect crowds but I was fortunate to get to check in at the lounge, which was faster. There's 4 places to choose your breakfast; that's how large it is.   Pros: -great location. Infinity pool, skypark, shopping mall, all within access. But Merlion is a 20 minute walk away. -fast checkin at the lounge -they said tower 1 breakfast at the ground floor is the best of the 4 options  Cons:  -get ready for crowds. Everybody always going to the infinity pool and skypark.  -if you go through the regular check in, the wait time could be 15 minutes.",8.0,2018-05-01

The pool is completely AMAZING btw and is a once in a lifetime experience!   We were able to check in early and thus enjoyed the pool at midday (it's quieter then because most people haven't checked in yet). By sunset, the pool is extremely busy.   Most people stay for the pool, it's an expensive stay but we enjoyed our time there. The rooms are large, modern and well cleaned, nothing too special (most good 4* and 5* hotels are a similar standard). Ask for a room overlooking the Gardens at the Bay - a much better view!   The hotel is really busy by the way, so if you don't like that, avoid.   Would love to stay again, but couldn't justify it to just to check out the pool",8.0,2018-06-01
