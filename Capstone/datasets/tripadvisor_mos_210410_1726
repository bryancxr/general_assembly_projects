The staff surprised us with a birthday card and cake, provided a room with a good view of Orchard Road, and also wished me happy birthday in person. The room was clean and the hotel was centrally located. The only drawback was the long check-in queue we encountered due to a sudden spike in staycation-goers because of the Singaporediscover vouchers. We queued for only 30 min because we didn’t use the vouchers to book our stay, but heard that those who used the vouchers had to wait even longer. We thought the hotel could have had separate queues for the guests who paid using the vouchers and those who paid in full so as to speed up the process, or at least provide online check-in services so that we don’t have to queue for long.

Hotel is a bit old, but room is clean and well-maintained. They can definitely improve on the TV, which currently feels like 20 years ago (it's not a smart TV), where only pay-per-view is available, with no Netflix or ability to connect to iPhone casting wirelessly.  What is very disappointing are (1) food quality and (2) customer service which is rather impersonal. Breakfast is a big let down (a la carte, not buffet, and priced at $36 before 17.7% taxes if not yet included in your room package), so you would be much better off taking that money and eat at other cafes/restaurants in Orchard.

For example, they sent a birthday cake up to our room when they found out it was my birthday! That was really appreciated. We stayed on the club floor and went to the Meritus Club for our meals. The view was outstanding and so was the food and drinks. We had such a great time. One employee in particular who stood out in the Meritus Club as extremely friendly and helpful was Mr. Jaya.

774001690,mos,tripadvisor,2020-10-01,,Not so good experience overall,"We had stayed for a 2 day 1 night staycation package which includes breakfast and access to the lounge.   We expect that food provided in the lounge to be refillable, however, upon asking for more, the staff nonchalantly told us that only one serving is allowed per person, this also applies to the breakfast, which i think is horrible, we have stayed in many hotels in the past, and not once did we experience food not refillable and such service from the hotel staff.  Also, we had requested for a 1 hour late checkout , it was granted, yet, 45 minutes before the agreed checkout timing, our TV access was removed, and 30 minutes before the agreed checkout time, the staff called us to chase us out of the room. This is horrible service.  Would hope the customer service can be improved,",4.0,2020-10-01
773907868,mos,tripadvisor,2020-10-01,Singapore,A 5-Star Staycation,"It was my 1st experience with the Mandarin Orchard Singapore. The room rate was very reasonable at $188++ with breakfast inclusive. Upon entering the hotel, there was safe entry to ensure all guests had done it. As I was about to head to the reception, I was confused on which lifts to take due to the 2 different towers. I had to approach the staff who was sitting to find out which lift to use. Signages were not prominent for a first timer. The staff was not proactive in engaging to assist the guests.  At Reception, Myra was pleasant & warm in welcoming me. I told her that I was early (11:30am) and was prepared to wait for the room. She assisted me in registration first, without any hesitation & offered to get me a room. After registration, she politely informed me that I might",10.0,2020-10-01

My room Number: 3125. Check in: 8 October 2020. Indeed, it is such lousy guest feeling to stay here. If anyone is reading this article and considering to book staycation to release your stress from Work From Home. I sincerely suggest you to book another international brand such as Accor Group Fairmont or Sofitel , IHG - intercontinental, shangrila..if u own a certain status in those group, they will really take care of you and provide you luxury feeling. I break into a few points here.  1. This is the worst. U must book Swimming pool and gym. I understand it is due to government safety management requirement.

The hotel had offered a Club Indulgence Staycation package that included access to the Top of M (Executive Lounge).  I wasn't expecting much as Mandarin Orchard is a rather old hotel, but the hotel has surpassed my expectations with its cleanliness and great service.  Rooms:  For an old hotel, the rooms are well maintained and are really clean.  We were given a connecting room on the 19 floor, Meritus Club Room.  I have stayed in many hotels and would say that this is one of the visibly cleanest rooms I have had the pleasure of staying in.  The layout of the room is functional as well, with USB charging ports and an HDMI port on the desk beside the TV.  Toilets came with a shower and a separate",10.0,2020-10-01
