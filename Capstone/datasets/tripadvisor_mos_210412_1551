We stayed in the Club Room and enjoying many benefits that we could ask for.  Starting with express check in, free local call, free meeting room to free snack and beverage at the club lounge. We can also choose to have breakfast at the club lounge if don't feel like walking all the way to the restaurant down stairs.  A mall just a lift button away and more in walking distance. My favorite? The massage chair inside the room!",10.0,2015-04-01

Chinese restaurant is noteworthy which is subject of another of my reviews.  Staff friendly and helpful.  Breakfast was so-so. But many choices outside the hotel so was really a non-issue.

We were given our room and headed there. Luckily my husband didn't like how close it was to the elevator so we called down. A young man arrived to take us to another room and low and behold, our first room wasn't IN A CLUB ROOM. Our new room was on a higher floor, the floor greets you telling you that you're on the club floor, and has nicer amenities. From that moment on, everything was great.  We were exhausted from 24 hours of travel. Being able to stay at the hotel to grab afternoon tea, dinner and drinks was worth everything in the world to us. That was the only day we used all the amenities we were able to, but each day, we arrived back and were at least able to",10.0,2015-05-01

With a club room you have the added advantage of access to the club lounge on the 38th floor with excellent views of the city. Breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails are all included in the price. The staff in the lounge really looked after Us throughout the trip, always attentive and welcoming with a smile and happy to chat.

The mall below the hotel was convenient too for restaurants, money exchange, and other services. The eating choices are fabulous at the property, too. The seafood offering at the brunch and buffet is amazing.   The only service issue I had was in the bar. It was happy hour and I asked to be seated at the pool since I could see from the lobby that the pool had a bar and seating on the opposite side of the bar window.
