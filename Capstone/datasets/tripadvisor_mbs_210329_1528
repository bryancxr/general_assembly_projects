But I probably wouldn't stay here for more than one night but instead move to a lesser priced 5 star hotel in the city because what the hotel offers is no different than others (sans the pool). I would recommend upgrading your room to a Club Room for the free breakfast, afternoon tea and early cocktails. It is worth it (if you are staying just one night). But the hotel bathroom products are their own and are not luxurious but more like Holiday Inn quality. The shampoo leaves your hair feeling coarse and smells cheap (like something you would expect at a 3 star hotel like Best Western)  so I would highly recommend folks bringing their own products (esp if one plans to swim).",8.0,2016-06-01

For business trips it is a hotel you should have experienced once in your life. Unfortunately most of the things that make this hotel so special, if you are working during daytime. The infinity pool is the highlight. Breakfast is not included in the room rate. The BF buffet is 50S$. Due to its location you very much depend on taxi and/or public transportation. I usually go to Orchard Road for dinner and this is about 10-15 minutes away by taxi (15S$). I would suggest to stay there on the way to your final destination for a max of 2 days.

While the Marina Bay area is entertaining to look at for a couple hours, the hotel is well away from the more interesting traditional areas of the city.

Bring light sweaters and long-sleeves for the room","Stayed in Marina Bay Sands (MBS) with my wife for six nights.  It was my first time to Asia, let alone Singapore.  Overall, I loved the experience although I'm not a fan of crowded countries or humidity.  The highlights of MBS are its: size (three amazing towers); location (attached to a fabulous mall; across the road from Gardens by the Bay - a good place to run outside; the breakfast buffet; gym; and, the infinity pool.  The drawback to MBS?  Temperature control in the rooms.  I suspect it's not the hotel's fault (faced the same challenge at a 5-star hotel in Lagos, Nigeria) but it's really difficult to control the room's atmosphere.  It's either stuffy or too cold.
