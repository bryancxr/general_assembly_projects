Deluxe rooms are economical than premier rooms. I am not sure on disadvantages of tower 3, but i feel there is no direct access to pool from that tower. To access the pool you need to come to tower 1 or 2, but as I said, I am not very sure of this.  I booked a premier room.

Toilet didn't have a bidet or a hose spray, however this can be forgiven given that the majority of Singaporean hotels lacks this feature.

Although, in the aims of being helpful I'd have to highlight some negatives. All the food is definitely overpriced. For example, the breakfast was simple and for just the meal it was £20 ($ US 30). Due to the location you are stuck at the hotel so factor this premium for all meals and drinks to derive the real price of this place. It's a shady practice and shouldn't be overlooked.

When I mention that the room was not clean properly with sugary drink stain on the table. The reception agree to cancel the breakfast. Now in London just realise that instead of refunding the difference on my deposit the hotel have charge me the refund. Who is an overcharge of more than 300 Singaporean dollars.

The rooms are spacious with beautiful views - we overlooked the Gardens by the Bay and they were gorgeous.  The pool is all that we thought it would be with stunning views.  The only complaint I have is service on the 57th floor.  We went up for a night swim and I thought it would be nice to sit on the lounge chair with a glass of wine and enjoy the evening.  It was difficult to find anyone to take my order, and then once the order was placed, it took a long time for my wine to arrive.  Given how expensive the drinks are, I would have expected better service.  In order to maximize our pool time, we decided to eat breakfast at the cafe by the pool in the morning.

We arrived and checked in no issue got an upgrade to a garden view deluxe room on 36th floor.  The only thing I can say, which I have not seen in any other view, is the city view rooms don't have a balcony, only the garden view rooms do. Viewing the hotel from the street, has windows all the way up that side of the building.  It was easy to get about having the MRT station under the hotel, you can",10.0,2014-10-01

That is why we decided to book the The Club room and it was a very clever idea! The room was just great, clean, large and with an outstanding view over the city. Our breakfasts were served at The Club 57th floor and the choice was excellent as well as the food quality. I can'd but admire of the staff, which was always friendly and helpful. The Club at the 57th floor also offers afternoon tea and evening coctails, which could be like a light dinner, we took that advantage several times and enjoyed it pretty much. Especially the evening visits. I agree with many reviewers that the check-in line looks deterrent and I saw that people",10.0,2014-11-01

Aside from that, the service was just ok and the food was not outstanding at the hotel restaurants.  The best thing about the hotel was the easy access to the subway that can take you to the real parts of Singapore, Little India, Chinatown and Arab Street.",8.0,2014-11-01
240472806,mbs,tripadvisor,2014-11-01,Philippines,top of the line efficient service!,"stayed at Marina Bay Sand for two nights- service was flawless from valet to check in, breakfast, use of amenities, check out and even airport transfers. Staff were curt but courteous as they were precise in instructions and directions. The breakfast spread is definitely something to boast of. The infinity pool can get quite crowded several times a day, but for a leisure traveler, waiting for the perfect moment to take a dip is no issue. The fact that the hotel is adjacent to one of the premier malls in the country is a sure advantage. And did I mention the view of the city is simply divine at any given time of the day? Definitely worth another stop in the near future!",10.0,2014-11-01
240470118,mbs,tripadvisor,2014-11-01,Australia,Ridiculously amazing pool,"Stayed at this hotel in a premium room  for two nights on the 41st floor with a garden/sea view.  (Make sure to ask (politely) for a high floor). I think this is nicer than the city view - especially since you can see the city from the pool. Also you can watch the Gardens by the Bay light show from our room (the music is a little hard to hear).   The room was very large with small balcony and large bathroom with a stand alone tub. The staff were very good - we got complimentary fruit plate and 40% at the buffet (buffet was ok, plenty of fresh seafood). Honestly, its all about the pool - its truly an amazing view although it can get very busy. Just find a spot on the edge, take a selfie and watch the city below!  Hotel is around 20 mins from the airport (~$15 by taxi) and 5 mins",10.0,2014-11-01

240345984,mbs,tripadvisor,2014-11-01,China,Overstated inelegance,"Let's be clear, this is not a luxury hotel in any meaningful sense. It's vulgar, massive, impersonal and isolated from Singapore proper. There are no thoughtful touches, no personal service and not an iota of style in the entire place. Expect to queue for everything, including check-in and breakfast.  My non-smoking room smelled of cigarettes, even though there was a balcony where one could easily smoke without causing a stink (precisely the reason it was put there, I guess).  People rave about the views from the 57th floor but... Singapore is a totally flat and very small island. Those skyscrapers you can see from downstairs? That's what you can see from upstairs, just from a slightly different angle. Glass and steel built on reclaimed land around an artificial marina. Welcome",4.0,2014-11-01
240345171,mbs,tripadvisor,2014-11-01,Australia,Amazing infinity pool & stunning views of the bay,"My husband and I stayed at Marina Bay Sands for 3 nights. I have given a 5 star rating due to the amazing infinity pool and the lovely spacious rooms. If you expect 5 star service then this is a bit of a hit and miss. Some staff members have exceptional customer service and others, appear to be very robotic. As soon as you enter the lobby, it feels like you are in a busy shopping centre. The rooms are extremely comfortable, clean & well designed with brilliant views - one of the bonuses was that we could get a smoking room (which is rare these days in 5 star hotels). Once you are in your room, it is just amazing as you have direct access to the pool and all other facilities. Edgar, the guest service agent who assisted to collect our luggage on check-out was excellent. This hotel",10.0,2014-11-01

The room is elegant, modern and spacious. The rest room is spacious, modern and cozy. The city view is amazing. Unfortunately I was not able to go to the afternoon tea and evening cocktails at the club room on the 57th floor for the 3 nights I was there coz I was busily shopping and hopping around the city haha. The breakfast buffet in the club room is also good. The spread though is not much unlike in Rise. Though I always ordered in-room service for my dinner. The service of the wait staff and the housekeeping staff is also impeccable and commendable. I would definitely stay here again.",10.0,2014-11-01

The facilities were absolutely stunning the decor in the hotel wasnt bad thought it may have been a bit more suave. I ordered inhouse dining got a really tasty pizza to go with the bottle of champagne i got at the airport whilst looking at one of the most spectacular skylines ive encountered from own hotel room.

There are other top hotels in Singapore with Infinity pools and views such as the Westin far better value.The impression I got was a vast money making mill, lots of expensive designer shops and casino and we the customers, the grist. A typical Las Vegas ideal,transported to Singapore, as they say a fool and their money are easily parted. The all",4.0,2014-11-01
