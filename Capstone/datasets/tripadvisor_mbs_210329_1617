We were also happy with the service at the pool.  Our only small complaint about the room is the sensitivity of the Mini bar and being charged if you did need a fridge.  The other thing is that the lobby of the hotel definitely feels more like a tourist attraction rather than the lobby of a 5 star hotel - I think something can be done to make this more private for hotel guests.

Really, the only reason to stay here are the pool and the views. There are other hotels in Singapore that offer a service just as good or better... For people who want a 5 star hotel experience this must be somewhat a letdown since this place is overcrowded with tourists staying here for a night just to be able to go to the pool and take selfies. It really depends on what you are looking for. Of course, the hotel rooms are very big and the view from your bedroom is spectacular. So if the rooftop pool and the views are worth the price for you, this is the place to be. I am glad I stayed here but I don't think I would come back. Location is good.

It was interesting to see and swim in it, but not sure it was worth the stay. The lobby was a madhouse.   You are also across the harbour from the main downtown attractions.

Also the lifts were constantly full.  We stayed on the 33-34th floors in Towers 3 and also rooms in Tower 2.  It could take up to 15 minutes to get down during check in and check out times, breakfast etc...

In addition, for the amount charged per night, I wish the hotel could have at least given me a pillow case in good order. The one I had had several holes in it. Time to change the bed linen?

View is magnificent and service is near perfect (we had a Club formula: waiters are just super good). These are the only good points. For the rest: it's a touristic industry. A Disney land (you'd pay 500€/night). Charmless international hotel. Getting a bit old anyway already due to intensive use I guess. You hear your neighboors receiving SMS, spitting and pissing. Swimming pool is like a lunapark. I'd rather say selfie-swimming pool. Impossible to find a couple of seats due to over-affluence. In fact we didn't even get in. Not fun to fight for a spot.
