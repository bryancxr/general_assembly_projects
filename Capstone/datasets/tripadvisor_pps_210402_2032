We have stayed in our fair share of big city hotels, but the Pan Pacific was really a step up from a lot of the hotels we've stayed in previously; if I was to compare it with anything, I would probably say it had a feel of a Vegas resort hotel about it (especially with the interesting design and awesome lifts!).
