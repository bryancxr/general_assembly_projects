While the hotel sells itself as a heritage hotel and the appearence of the hotel from the outside is certainly very grandious and is justifiably a prominent landmark, the inside feels completely re-done in a 90's style hotel with little of the heritage feel (but still nice).  Little issues that I had with the hotel were that as they did not have a double available, I took a twin room, I do not think I have seen such small twin beds in a hotel before, they reminded me of my childhood bed. Also the coffee cups in my in-room coffee set were not cleaned, which is a bit careless.",6.0,2019-10-01
